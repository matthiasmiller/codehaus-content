Unknown Speaker  00:03
I'm gonna go log up to my My big screen, in

Unknown Speaker  00:18
general, it's i

Speaker 1  00:50
Okay, switch, I'm gonna hang all right. Signal up, somehow. Oh, you did already. Okay? I did all right. Well, where to begin? So shall we just start talking about the ads and then work on the page? Sure, and I'm going to try to pull up Caleb's actual post while we're talking.

Matthias Miller  01:20
Were you still thinking to try to mimic his model? Or were you thinking, I know you talked about Joel Erway power offer,

Speaker 1  01:29
so Caleb's and I'm probably behind the times or asleep at the wheel or something, but Caleb's post and nothing held back said, message me for samples, and I did, but he never sent me an ad sample. Did he send you one? No. Did he describe the ad somewhere else, and I missed it? He

Matthias Miller  01:55
I don't know that he did, but I'm gonna guess it's gonna be easy to find funnel hackers, funnel bandits. Let's see if funnel bandits is running traffic. By the way, I've been playing around with messenger ads on my little hobby project, and it's absolutely fast. Anyway, I'm just having a fascinating time with traffic. It's just the weirdest thing

Speaker 1  02:28
that's great. Well, what kind of conversations are you getting as a result in Messenger?

Matthias Miller  02:34
Oh, this is, this is just my blog stuff as a side note. Okay, so I took my highest performing posts, assumed there, and then turned them into a hook. And so the biggest one was freeing up 10 hours a week, and and then just saying what the root pain point is, and how much people are willing to talk to a complete stranger about what's going on, and, and have they? I mean, I had one who was like, she hasn't replied yet, so I don't know if she's working, but she just, she sent a message at like, 5am saying, ultimately, confessing that she works at Hardee's, and, you know, kind of embarrassed about it, but it pays the bills. And I'm like, Okay, so, you know, no no judgment, but basically, sounds like you want a higher paying you need a higher paying job to free up time. She's like, Yeah. I'm like, Well, I mean, that's pretty obvious. Anyway. The other fun thing is, while we're distracted, before we get focused, and I'm also looking up, I got distracted because Facebook was notifying me about this. I also, after years of hankering to have a podcast, I am finally launching one just for fun as a strict hobby project. So there you go.

Unknown Speaker  04:06
Did you put some in the chat? I'm way up looking for

Matthias Miller  04:08
no. I mean, I could send you the link, but

Matthias Miller  04:18
this is the this is the link. I

Unknown Speaker  04:24
there just one more second. And here's the text of what he said

Matthias Miller  04:33
so he doesn't have any ads on the funnel bandits page.

Unknown Speaker  04:40
Caleb Shaw.

Speaker 1  04:53
I like his. This is totally Russell Brunson, by the way, these hilarious little hand drawn i. Graphics on his page.

Unknown Speaker  05:11
Charles posts. I

Unknown Speaker  05:25
trying to look at Springboard funnels. I'm

Speaker 1  05:46
I'm just asking him right now for that, because he said we run a three part ad sequence. That points okay.

Unknown Speaker  05:55
Now there is some

Matthias Miller  05:58
Springboard drive

Speaker 1  06:00
I was, I did. I'm looking at his post again, and he talks about what the ad should be, and that had gone over my head, or I had forgotten it, one of the two. So that answers that question is, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  06:26
Okay, now

Matthias Miller  06:28
I know I had put some stuff together into document, HubSpot, buyer, psychology, no, not there

Unknown Speaker  06:34
shit. Titans,

Matthias Miller  06:39
okay, this is annoying.

Speaker 1  06:42
Okay, and I got, I need to go now. So what if you don't mind put you on I'll put myself on mute and All, and I'll be fast As I can Cool You.

Unknown Speaker  22:40
And I'm back.

Matthias Miller  22:41
am I supposed to be looking at something specific? It's I'm trying to get it to spit it all out right now in a readable fashion, so it only was allowed to share it three, yeah. And I'm. M back. All right, so, sorry, with delay. All good, what I have been doing for the last 15 or however long it's been has been hacking the My bad. I had you meet it now, you're back. What I've been doing for the. last. Since You've Been Gone, is hacking the $5 GPT to get me it's knowledge, and I have I uh, here, let's do so I'm going to see If I can get clod to stitch it back together and in A whole document form, I'm but I think This will get us some sample ads. I E sentences at a time. So I'm now having Claude stitch it all together into a single document.

Unknown Speaker  25:08
Interesting I do have I

Unknown Speaker  25:23
let's see,

Matthias Miller  25:34
there's a folder here with with All kinds of materials in it. Um,

Unknown Speaker  25:46
got it. I'm

Matthias Miller  26:38
there's an AI prompt, an unlocked AI prompt that allows copywriting for their vision to funnel wizard.

Unknown Speaker  26:51
There's also i

Matthias Miller  27:35
All right, I got it here, dropping in a document in here. I'm Um,

Matthias Miller  27:52
okay, it's in the document as Springboard actually dropped off. That's fine.

Unknown Speaker  27:59
Sorry, sneezing. Oh, good, yeah, okay, the sprint board process, which

Matthias Miller  28:07
one? Yes, Springboard client process. It's supposed to be that. And if you go down, I

Unknown Speaker  28:23
Yes, down to where,

Matthias Miller  28:28
somewhere here, I was sure I saw Yeah. Ad Copy examples on page I don't know where, where I'm highlighted. Click the name.

Unknown Speaker  28:35
Do you see it? Yes, yep. So the

Matthias Miller  28:40
video script, if you're still doing sales calls, you have a hook, promise of value, value bomb, humble brag. The content solve one small problem. Next step, here's the springboard,

Unknown Speaker  28:59
and then I'm phase two.

Unknown Speaker  29:16
So I'm

Speaker 1  29:26
I'm thinking, give me one split second. I'm thinking, we can drop this into chat DPT and get it to, like, convert over from his pitch to our pitch.

Matthias Miller  29:33
Yeah, I think so. And also, I want to do one other thing I've been playing with, sorry, playing. I've been exploring a training around

Unknown Speaker  29:49
find this.

Unknown Speaker  29:56
It's in SAM card. I.

Unknown Speaker  30:14
So Google Doc with props. I

Unknown Speaker  30:25
Yeah, so if

Matthias Miller  30:38
so something like, I'm not sure if I want to use chat, GPT or cloud here, but can you help me use the springboard client, Springboard method and process to put together A campaign for HubSpot to go high level migration. Can you please ask questions

Unknown Speaker  31:07
about the offer? If you need so? I

Unknown Speaker  31:27
client process that we Have. I'm

Unknown Speaker  31:44
then we have I'm

Matthias Miller  32:30
gathering my thoughts. Great. I'm

Matthias Miller  32:45
okay, well, do you want to help?

Matthias Miller  32:52
Help to help me fill this out. Yeah, let's do it step by step migration. I'm going to throw freedom the microwave step by step. Migration process, what do you like? What do we,

Speaker 1  33:03
Hey, real quick, because before we proceed, where did the prompt itself come from?

Unknown Speaker  33:09
It came from the, I mean, it came from the, from the, I had to give it

Matthias Miller  33:22
to me from the the prompt itself came from their custom $5 GPT that they sold. And he has a client process, PDF and an instruction that PDF. That's part of the prompt knowledge base.

Speaker 1  33:32
Oh, so you bought this from Caleb. I didn't even realize that was an option. Okay.

Matthias Miller  33:36
I well, I mean, I bought a link to the custom GPT and then got the information out.

Unknown Speaker  33:41
Uh huh, okay, all right,

Matthias Miller  33:45
sure, it's not the intended design, but whatever.

Speaker 1  33:51
Okay, hey, I'd love to help you build out a springboard campaign. Yep, okay. Define transformation. Migration costing is based on what you shared, yep, so you deeply understand audience, yep, okay, and what makes you or so? What's your step?

Matthias Miller  34:10
I think it's, I mean, the Steps are something like this. I

Speaker 1  35:10
I would add a beginning step that's kind of like onboarding and analysis, onboarding and discovery, something I don't know what The Right. Yeah. I

Speaker 1  35:41
and then pause before you hit go. I don't mind, sure.

Unknown Speaker  35:58
Okay, here, let's do this.

Speaker 1  36:20
Before you hit Enter, let's cover a couple of quick bases. How much HubSpot Have you worked with? In my case, just barely,

Matthias Miller  36:32
a decent amount. And we set up a custom API integration to suck messages out.

Speaker 1  36:42
How similar is it to GHL? Like same thing it does, email, automations, SMS, automations, generally

Matthias Miller  36:48
the same. Potentially it's got different. I mean, it's ballpark the same. I mean, I'm not sure who will I have access to Yoders finally kicked me out, out of some of their systems, at least, okay, um.

Matthias Miller  37:12
But like, they've got contacts, companies, deals. They call it deals instead of opportunities, tickets lists. I mean, it's just

Speaker 2  37:22
um. They do

Matthias Miller  37:26
have landing pages. They do have, I'm going to guess work workflows. We don't have access to them anymore because we're on the free plan, basically, dashboards, I mean, very hand wavy, broadly speaking, is basically the same, obviously, depending on we're assuming that people don't have super complex workflows

Speaker 1  37:52
correct, and if they do, they're literally not the right case for us. And they probably do need their HubSpot Well, they probably

Matthias Miller  37:59
won't even show up at her front door. But, I mean, in a weird situation, they might, but very unlikely.

Speaker 1  38:05
Yeah, okay, are the line so on your bullet point number one, the end of that, look for opportunities to improve the sales process. Are we literally talking about follow up and nurture automation, because technically speaking, this doesn't Sell.

Unknown Speaker  38:32
Should we? What

Matthias Miller  38:36
are you suggesting?

Speaker 1  38:42
Are we? Are we hoping to offer that we improve their nurturing and follow up sequence stuff,

Matthias Miller  38:49
not at this offer that should be an upsell down the road. I think, okay, so then I

Speaker 1  38:53
think deleting that line is the right thing to do. Do you agree? My two cents, see what they use. Yeah, I'm thinking for this, and I'm open. I'm not I'm not dictating. But for this past, this, like entry level offer, or what, or whatever we want to call this that we're doing today, this is, like, literally, the value is pure migration. Just save you money by moving platforms. There might be all kinds of details involved in that, but that's techie, and is not marketing, sales, support, optimization, really, in any way. That would probably be an upsell. I think

Matthias Miller  39:34
I would agree. No reason why not. I'm not easy, yeah, I'm not even

Speaker 1  39:38
wearing my money making hat. I'm just thinking like one thing at a time. Thing at a time

Unknown Speaker  39:43
here fair. I.

Speaker 1  40:00
It is interesting to consider that this whole strategy could be a foot in the door to quite a number of things. So consulting for you, or ads or who knows what copywriting agreed.

Matthias Miller  40:17
All right, anything else before I hit Enter, I think it's good. You can tell I'm very lazy with how I communicate with AI.

Unknown Speaker  40:25
I think you do way better than average. I

Speaker 1  40:48
i like the power move, not a panic move in terms of messaging, not quite correct, or analyzing their entire tech stack. I

Matthias Miller  41:55
Hey, what do you think about This?

Unknown Speaker  42:01
I like it exactly. Yep, I'm

Speaker 3  42:39
that's pretty good. Yep, why is it swearing at me, but

Matthias Miller  42:52
the source documents had the F word in it.

Unknown Speaker  42:56
Okay? I

Unknown Speaker  43:41
It's good. Oh,

Unknown Speaker  43:53
boy, I'm

Unknown Speaker  44:12
typical price Point. I'm

Unknown Speaker  44:20
I think You think Seems good. I

Unknown Speaker  46:15
What is that about? I'm paying for

Matthias Miller  46:17
their $500 a month premium support, which gives me a Slack channel with their team, which

Unknown Speaker  46:23
is

Speaker 1  46:28
side note, real quick, I've been having a bunch of a to pay a to P failures this last week. How did your last shot of that go? They went through

Matthias Miller  46:36
Heather. I need to get with podium to transfer the Twilio number over, but the other one went through earlier this week. She gave me the wrong ein so that It failed the first time. But okay, do

Matthias Miller  47:28
How old Am I?

Unknown Speaker  47:30
We've got where I'm

Matthias Miller  48:15
does his conversation? History tool have a name? History bridge, condo, Vault, message, rescue.

Unknown Speaker  48:30
What do they call it? I

Matthias Miller  48:45
HubSpot, risk, HubSpot rescue history, rescue Do you?

Matthias Miller  48:59
Do you have any brilliant ideas on what to call that? That thing I

Speaker 1  49:04
do one second? Okay, I was thinking that rescue sounds too much like recovery, which has nothing to do with it. It's more like preservation. So how about some synonyms for preserve or conserve. Message conservatory. Some others are, keep, Safeguard,

Unknown Speaker  49:31
protect.

Unknown Speaker  49:35
Message protector.

Matthias Miller  49:38
I wish I could like, is there an antique like, if I would love a name that taps into fear of loss. I.

Matthias Miller  50:00
There's almost like this undelete, except it's not an undelete.

Speaker 1  50:11
Defender. Message defender, no, it's not all right. Message shield, that's all a little too strong. I almost think. Message guard, guards, not bad. History. Guard, actually, that's not bad. What about that? History? Guard, message. Guard, or something like that. I

Speaker 1  51:06
Why do you write? I am literally talking only about when speaking to AI, why do you write self deprecating things like but I don't know if it's possible. Possible.

Matthias Miller  51:20
I don't know I it. It means I don't I can't think of anything. Okay, I don't know why. It's just speaking my brain. I should say it'd be more accurate, but I can't think of anything off the top of my head.

Speaker 1  51:38
You're not just migration technician, so better process. Angle, history, ball. Convo, safe, the memory bank, history, shield, never to lose the conversation. TM, can you tolerate me telling a story for the fun of it? Sure. Um, so there's this fellow. You may have seen him. I have no idea what his name is, but he goes around interviewing successful business people, and he was asking some and so he always asked like, a question or two, like, you know, what was the biggest change for you, or what made you the most you know something. And this fellow said that his biggest secret in business is trademarks, and that the reason it's his business secret I'm referring to this never lose a conversation. TM right here in front of us is that you can make claims as a trademark, and people cannot prevent you from using your trademark, and yet you can say I didn't make a claim. That's just my trademark. So you could say, Never lose a conversation. TM, if, in fact, you have lost the conversation or two, and it's not a claim, it's a trademark. I'm actually kind of liking this, except that, you know, I think trademarks are a little hard to get the guy in question that I'm referring to classic entrepreneur thing. He just tried niche after niche after niche after niche. And what finally made him a multi millionaire was vaping, sadly, but he said, in New York, he trademarked, what was it? The the most trusted, like something like that, the most trusted vape, and put that in advertisements on taxi cabs, even though most trusted according to who or what, nothing. It was smoke and mirrors, okay and No, no steady, no feedback. That's not even customer reviews. It's literally just words in a trademark. And he said it made him, I can't remember, like 100,000,500 million. It was a lot. It was not small. And he said he was so successful with that from that campaign that he never even expanded to the West Coast. Anyway, whatever I thought of that as soon as I saw I'd never lose the conversation, which, like my first reaction was, ooh, that's risky. And then I saw the trademark emblem over there.

Matthias Miller  54:10
The the conversation bank is also interesting. Yeah, yeah. Or conversation vault,

Unknown Speaker  54:18
conversation vault, yeah. Or

Speaker 1  54:28
guard kind of like the guard you like the guard

Matthias Miller  54:32
conversation? Guard, yeah, what had I suggested? Message? Guard, history, card, conversation. I like conversation better than message.

Unknown Speaker  54:39
I do too, yeah? Yeah,

Speaker 1  54:47
are, I mean, I can see that fitting perfectly in their little i.

Speaker 1  55:02
Before you okay to share your honest opinion, there you go. It's, it's own little quote immediately above, we could use it in copy, like most migrations abandoned two plus years of conversation history, our conversation guard technology ensures like I think that flows really well.

Speaker 1  55:33
Hey, I like the rating. Let's ask, What if you want my real opinion. I think Convo vault is slightly because vault improvisational protection and value,

Unknown Speaker  55:48
conversation, vodka,

Unknown Speaker  55:59
yeah, says, Great,

Matthias Miller  56:06
I love, I love, like, I know it's such a dumb eco trip, but man, it's fun. When AI says, Wow, that's a really good one. It often happens with subject lines. I have a subject line writer.

Speaker 1  56:31
I'm probably too much of an IT guy, but vault doesn't sound like money or value to me. Vault sounds like storage or archiving, and we're not archiving, we're preserving.

Matthias Miller  56:47
Well, it's like, are you putting it into the vault instead of,

Unknown Speaker  56:52
there's no vault, though, like, we're not a backup service, or, I

Speaker 1  57:09
It's it too, Yeah, yep, yep, yep, yep,

Matthias Miller  57:56
I don't know,

Unknown Speaker  57:58
maybe We were thinking I'm

Speaker 1  58:00
pretty sold on conversation guard. I'm not trying to twist your arm either. I just don't like better.

Matthias Miller  58:07
I don't have a I don't feel like I've got a good sense of what i i

Speaker 1  58:28
You want to run it together with no space? I

Matthias Miller  58:48
I don't know it doesn't have a trademark. That's fine. I mean, I don't I mean, I don't care. I

Matthias Miller  59:05
uh, I'm thinking, I guess, what do you think Audrey and I had talked about potentially doing something like a burning cash offer, like $1,000 to free up 15 grand or more. But there's also this conversation guard in which we could sell them. It's a little bit of X, a little bit of work, but where we could sell them an export of their data. They set up the API key, they feed it over to us. We do the exports, send the files back

Unknown Speaker  59:55
as $1,000 offer.

Speaker 1  59:59
Uh. I like as an upsell. I'm sorry, I'm trying to understand, if you're wondering, right, the two,

Matthias Miller  1:00:07
okay, so I don't know. I'm just saying Caleb stack is $5 and $1,000 and maybe 1000 and then, and then there's more on the back end. But are we, are we literally selling a are we literally selling the full implementation off of this attend to 25k engagement,

Speaker 1  1:00:31
as as an upsell, I just have this feeling I'm misunderstanding you so, like, this is step two,

Matthias Miller  1:00:38
yeah, I guess the question is, do we go from Okay, Caleb's is zero to $5 to $1,000 and then he's got some kind of backs back end, which I'm gonna guess is just manage, just like management, like ongoing Ad Management or something. I don't know. What is our what are our offers and for how much?

Unknown Speaker  1:01:07
Does

Speaker 1  1:01:11
that make sense? Yeah, it does. So first, I don't think we have anything. That's the $5 version. Are we? Are we agree on that? I

Matthias Miller  1:01:19
don't know. He seems to think it's a good idea, but I don't know.

Speaker 1  1:01:23
But okay, so let's Daydream for a minute. What could we possibly offer that is still on the same track, meaning not a distraction or diversion, something to do with migrating away from HubSpot, but, but that would only cost, like less than 100 bucks.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:44
What would that be?

Speaker 1  1:01:49
You know, Caleb, given that he was posting and nothing held back, he probably more or less followed Alan, Alan's sultanics model, right, which is a low ticket funnel. I By the way, I've never taken the time to read exactly how that goes, but it's a low ticket funnel. So there's probably jolly good reason to start with a $5 offer, however, and his $5 offer was literally a chat GBT prompt to help you start to build this funnel. You come up with a plan, I guess. And he's probably thinking, which is smart, that like 99 anybody is going to pay five bucks without blinking an eye. They're going to start this. They're going to spend half an hour talking to Claude, just like you and I are doing right now. And then they're going to say, You know what, I really want Caleb to do this for me instead. And he's probably counting on that. So like, but how could What is your version of that?

Matthias Miller  1:02:42
You could have a GPT that gives them a checklist. I mean, it's still a plan. Gives them a checklist and all the scary things that can go sideways.

Speaker 1  1:02:54
If we were real suave and sophisticated and experienced, I would say it could be almost like a Are you ready to migrate checklist like, you know it's worth spending $5 to buy my custom chat GPT to find out if you can save yourself $40,000 a month. Oh, I don't know what that would look like, and I'm not sure how necessary or helpful it is to trying to sell our service. I'm not shooting it down either. I'm just saying, literally. I do not know

Matthias Miller  1:03:32
well, but it's very easy to sell. Spend five, $5 see if you can, you can save 50. I mean, it's not quite that, but that's pretty wild.

Speaker 1  1:03:44
Can you picture what such a GPT would actually check says this? The other problem is, like the GPT that Caleb sold you is kind of like just producing copy, which is really easy for an AI theme to do, whereas a GPT that is going to actually check their HubSpot, you know, data quality or something, is going to have to have an API key in the HubSpot. There's going to be some setup involved and all that, because it's not purely external.

Matthias Miller  1:04:22
Yeah, none. We're not going to do an export. I'm not going to do an export for less than 1000 I don't mind setting an API key for 1000 and doing an export for 1000 bucks. That's fine, but and potentially having a way that they can get, I don't know, daily exports or something,

Speaker 1  1:04:40
um, that's fine. Everything I just said was literally in the context of what can we sell for five bucks?

Matthias Miller  1:04:47
So, what can we sell for five I don't know what does well, okay, I.

Speaker 1  1:05:46
I'm assuming it has context from one of those docs that it went in red, I think so. I'm hoping, by the way, we have any proof that it actually read and understood the doc. So what it said, right there, is very true, but also very generic. Yeah, there next line down, that's, that is literally what crossed my mind is, this is a readiness assessment, like a, you know, are you in a good spot to do that?

Matthias Miller  1:06:16
Well, it seems to, like it, um, do you have any psychology reasons from your from the materials I shared to inform why you are going this direction, not

Matthias Miller  1:07:00
I mean, I am almost positive. Let me see if I can

Unknown Speaker  1:07:15
find it. AI tool I was

Matthias Miller  1:07:22
thinking, there's An explanation,

Matthias Miller  1:07:32
ideas You're getting. I

Matthias Miller  1:08:31
um, is that the right price?

Speaker 1  1:08:38
And, yeah, fine, like I literally, there's no reason to be stuck on a price meat, anything. Totally don't care. I

Speaker 1  1:09:26
I love I love the you have approximately 47,000 conversations at risk. That's like straight out of antivirus. You know, your computer or malware scanner has detected 52 suspicious files. That's awesome.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:46
Oh, that is great.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:57
Um, I.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:20
Maybe I should throw this at A

Unknown Speaker  1:10:58
um, I

Matthias Miller  1:11:04
Hang on. I

Speaker 1  1:11:23
I'm rereading Caleb's post just just talking for the fun of it. I did notice the very first thing Caleb said is, if you've got a mid ticket offer, so literally, that's the plan is to sell something in the $1,000 range. And then a little further down, he did specify that the page and use has multiple CTAs for a $5 offer, there's an AI tool, so like that is literally what Caleb's system is built around. My point being that it's probably essential to do this. In order to do that, Caleb's funnel to do AI. I think you're right. Well, well, to do a $5 $5 AI offer. But if so, $5 no brainer offer. In his case, AI tools. So why not mimic what works? Right?

Matthias Miller  1:12:14
By the way, we should make The

Matthias Miller  1:12:22
I know we had I

Unknown Speaker  1:12:52
offer sales sheet.

Matthias Miller  1:12:55
It was in here. Oh, here it is. I'm

Unknown Speaker  1:13:07
okay, let's take the shed rescue.

Matthias Miller  1:13:12
We're gonna genericize this. Isn't

Unknown Speaker  1:13:17
it frustrating?

Matthias Miller  1:13:21
It is frustrating it is frustrating to me how much of marketing is really has

Matthias Miller  1:13:37
nothing to do with marketing. It has all has to do with business. Yeah, I out

Speaker 1  1:13:46
of curiosity, you want to shut your webcam off and save bandwidth sure i

Unknown Speaker  1:14:02
Okay,

Speaker 1  1:14:04
this is the generic CRM offers and price points. Okay, yep, generics. Here you

Unknown Speaker  1:14:44
What do you terrifer standard, blah, blah

Speaker 1  1:14:55
you're saying. I agree with this. What's funny is it feels like we're playing in. The corporate or large business space here,

Unknown Speaker  1:15:06
Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:15:37
okay, so We have The I'm

Speaker 1  1:17:59
because of the audit, While looking at migrating he discovered that one of his sales per People was not working. I

Speaker 1  1:18:57
HubSpot makes you piece together multiple tools go high level. Has it all native? Is that true?

Matthias Miller  1:19:04
I think typically, I'm sure

Matthias Miller  1:19:29
well, it's for an add on,

Unknown Speaker  1:19:33
meaning that it costs extra, right? But it is there. I

Matthias Miller  1:19:47
But does it actually have it's SMS marketing. But does it have SMS conversations? Whoa, I.

Matthias Miller  1:20:24
Okay, it does. It's just an add on that most people don't want to pay For.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:38
Um HubSpot does not have a power dial. Oh,

Matthias Miller  1:21:22
all right, some team members, well, some I'm

Matthias Miller  1:21:43
Yeah, exactly. That's, that's Yes,

Speaker 1  1:21:47
uh, apparently you read much faster than me. Guys, nothing it can't do is this nickel and diamond with add ons. Is that what you're saying? Exactly, too?

Matthias Miller  1:21:54
Yes, that's what they charge. Is

Speaker 1  1:21:57
extra extra for calling, extra for texting, extra for everything. Yeah, I love it. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:22:11
it's awesome.

Matthias Miller  1:22:15
Gonna go with the one page restructure. Yep, I

Unknown Speaker  1:22:23
we got through all the questions. Number six was the last one?

Matthias Miller  1:22:26
Yep, that's the one last one they had up above. They started taking me down a different

Speaker 1  1:22:30
path. Did you happen to feed it? Caleb's current one pager as an example? Um,

Unknown Speaker  1:22:46
let's see.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:57
Do you have I

Speaker 1  1:23:08
what I'm trying to decide if I should bite my tongue or not. Does it bother you at all to call out HubSpot by name?

Matthias Miller  1:23:22
Um? Uh, why? I mean, why should I I'm not disagreeing, I'm just curious,

Unknown Speaker  1:23:30
um, suffering the wrath of HubSpot and its lawyers.

Matthias Miller  1:23:37
So theoretically, we might build a whole business and have them come cracking down on me because

Speaker 1  1:23:43
you're giving them a bad name, or whatever corporations like to have their lawyers do in their spare time. Well, you could

Matthias Miller  1:23:49
not call it HubSpot. You could call it hell spot or something like and it would just be funnier

Unknown Speaker  1:23:59
the spot

Unknown Speaker  1:24:02
that's funny.

Unknown Speaker  1:24:05
Okay, I probably shouldn't worry about it right now. I mean, who's hub spots? Next, biggest competitor? I

Speaker 3  1:24:29
Salesforce, Zendesk, Zoho.

Matthias Miller  1:24:37
I would almost it is almost too funny not to just straight up,

Unknown Speaker  1:24:54
just give it

Unknown Speaker  1:24:57
a nickname, like it's. Just think it's

Matthias Miller  1:25:08
calling it out.

Speaker 1  1:25:18
Spot it's body CRM. She didn't say, are you Tired of your spotty CRMs?

Matthias Miller  1:26:12
Yeah, I don't know. Should I be concerned?

Speaker 1  1:26:15
No, which is why I said I was sitting here trying to decide if I

Speaker 1  1:26:53
Okay, we'll have to. I love the if you're emotionally attached to the HubSpot logo, save us. That's awesome. If you're under 1 million. I like the line. I think 1 million is way too big. More like if you're under, I don't know, 100k

Unknown Speaker  1:27:07
okay, let's do this. Let's do let's

Matthias Miller  1:27:13
go back to this guy. We're going to start adding prefixes. This is the are you aware that

Speaker 1  1:27:22
you're really good at this? You're like, you're actually doing it. I'm just watching you, and you're doing it so fast I can hardly keep up.

Matthias Miller  1:27:30
Well, I I, but you're catching all the things I would miss, um,

Speaker 1  1:27:36
mostly by being a silly goose in Here, speculating, or whatever.

Matthias Miller  1:27:44
All right, so

Unknown Speaker  1:27:53
interesting note.

Unknown Speaker  1:28:02
I once again,

Matthias Miller  1:28:18
they're overseas somewhere. I

Matthias Miller  1:28:25
A ethically AI driven.

Unknown Speaker  1:28:34
Sorry, what is ethically AI driven?

Matthias Miller  1:28:36
The perfect fit CRM, anyway, Perfect Fit CRM is actually something that is used. Okay? I

Matthias Miller  1:29:20
now remove migration is interesting.

Unknown Speaker  1:29:24
I like that.

Speaker 1  1:29:26
Yeah, I really like that, and it fits one to one with everything it's already been saying. Anyway,

Matthias Miller  1:29:31
so let's go find myself. I

Matthias Miller  1:29:46
All right, if you're an agency paying $2,000 a month an agency, if you're a you're a small business,

Unknown Speaker  1:29:56
do you want to i? If you're a business owner,

Speaker 1  1:30:06
about if your business is, if your business is tank

Matthias Miller  1:30:12
and you know you're getting and you know you're getting nickeled and dimed, your single process in the next today's exact migration process we use to help businesses like yours escape HubSpot without losing a single conversation like your hours last month alone. This is not last month. I

Matthias Miller  1:30:43
and This year alone Doesn't sound impressive. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:31:55
I'm actually interested in I

Matthias Miller  1:32:04
I mean, this is interesting,

Unknown Speaker  1:32:07
of it

Matthias Miller  1:32:17
makes me Sound I

Matthias Miller  1:33:37
All right, does a an Eight? Does an eight year old coder qualify as building and optimizing tech stacks? I suppose it's true, even if it's not meaningful Tech

Unknown Speaker  1:33:52
where would you adapt it?

Speaker 1  1:33:55
You're trying to contrast your 31 years experience to an eight year

Matthias Miller  1:33:59
old. No, no, I'm saying 31 years includes anything since I was eight years old.

Unknown Speaker  1:34:05
Yes, it does, absolutely, yes It does.

Unknown Speaker  1:34:19
Okay, so I'm

Matthias Miller  1:35:09
All right. Cloud web page sometimes freezes. I'm

Speaker 1  1:35:30
all AI, something went wrong there. Maybe it can understand it anyway, all without losing

Unknown Speaker  1:35:38
it's too abrupt.

Matthias Miller  1:35:42
I think we would just do something like this. I

Matthias Miller  1:35:49
think this is better, and we help them fix it all without losing

Unknown Speaker  1:35:59
I love it

Matthias Miller  1:36:01
like the like the business owner whose sales person had a full voicemail was refusing to return leads or the win i

Matthias Miller  1:36:33
Well, even I'm

Matthias Miller  1:36:54
What HubSpot plan gives you deals I

Unknown Speaker  1:37:03
uh, sales up.

Matthias Miller  1:37:12
No, it wasn't quite true. He was using some deals,

Unknown Speaker  1:37:18
so say, but barely using them, or not getting his money worth, or, you know,

Matthias Miller  1:37:23
like, well, barely even using deals. There you go. This is only possible because we spent 31 years.

Matthias Miller  1:37:42
Okay, come on, complied. You know, better than this. I

Matthias Miller  1:38:00
What are we going to say? 200k I'm

Matthias Miller  1:38:26
okay, 250, 500

Speaker 1  1:38:28
well, what's the minimum that you find people actually paying a significant, significant chunk a month for HubSpot?

Matthias Miller  1:38:38
I would be surprised if you would see them much under a million. But am I wrong?

Unknown Speaker  1:38:45
Yoder making

Matthias Miller  1:38:46
they were doing two.

Speaker 1  1:38:52
What's the minimum price to get started with HubSpot? Is it 2k? A month? Oh, it's free to get started. Okay, what's the first plan that? Yeah, let's just look at some pricing here. Okay, so we're literally not looking to interact with the small business users. We are actually looking for the people paying for the enterprise plans and not doing anything with it.

Unknown Speaker  1:39:20
Yeah.

Speaker 1  1:39:23
Yeah, you're probably right. I'm somehow just like, shocked at the idea that it has to be 1 million or higher. But okay,

Matthias Miller  1:39:31
well, I mean, I think for the migration offer, it makes sense. I mean, or I mean, but maybe I

Unknown Speaker  1:39:47
I don't know,

Unknown Speaker  1:39:50
let's call it half a million.

Matthias Miller  1:39:58
And if I'm charging. I've been charging 900 a month. I don't know if I can sustain that on this, especially if I don't have any kind of moat that gets people, I mean, I think, you know, they can argue I can, I can go, get a go high level for 90 $97 a month. Why am

Speaker 1  1:40:17
I paying you 900 paying you 900 you're doing sub accounts and just charging them 900

Matthias Miller  1:40:23
Yeah, the main ones I am though, are have custom Shut up integrations and but I have discounted, like, a secondary location at 600 Heather, I'm only charging 297 because I just it's a one man show at this point, it just doesn't make sense to charge more than that.

Speaker 1  1:40:44
I agree strongly and how much. I can't even remember how their commission structure works. If you were to have people start signing up for their own GHL, what do you get? Like

Matthias Miller  1:40:56
if they did it on their own as an affiliate? I get 40% but they sign up under SaaS mode. Under me, I get 100% of revenue.

Speaker 1  1:41:06
I guess I'm not familiar with SaaS mode, but that's cool. SaaS mode just means they have a sub account, which

Matthias Miller  1:41:15
means I have, I basically pay $500 a month, and I get to keep what

Speaker 1  1:41:19
I make. Yep, you're right, yeah. Okay, that's awesome. So, but at that point,

Matthias Miller  1:41:23
are we planning to, if we're planning to sell them at 297 I think you can justify 297 I think you can also say, hey, look, do you want to hire to your support? Like, that's going to be 900 a month. Like, if you want, you want my level of expertise, that's 900 a month. But if you just want to whatever show up and figure things out. Go, just pay 297, whatever. Okay, I

Matthias Miller  1:42:03
they put this at 497, AI,

Matthias Miller  1:42:12
technically is an upsell,

Unknown Speaker  1:42:19
and AI for just $100 more.

Speaker 1  1:42:31
Do we want to point high level out at all? I don't know. I think not, not until they're a little deeper in with this. Meanwhile, your

Matthias Miller  1:42:44
competitors get it all for 297, a month.

Speaker 1  1:42:48
I like that. Yeah, there's, I think there's no reason to bring up high level at that point on the page. Right.

Matthias Miller  1:42:56
Most businesses we audit, I

Matthias Miller  1:43:07
they didn't Even audit. It's Like, no, okay. I

Unknown Speaker  1:44:00
you. About it like this.

Matthias Miller  1:44:24
No, You're mixing it up. You

Speaker 1  1:44:45
the one time I tried to do anything like this in chat GPT, I found that after about this long, it just started getting totally lost, like it couldn't read its own document or something almost worth starting a new session or. Something, um, I'm

Unknown Speaker  1:45:28
here we go.

Unknown Speaker  1:45:30
Let's try this started

Matthias Miller  1:45:36
the real dream of the promise of all you want, everything you need. I'm

Matthias Miller  1:45:45
it's like doing a gym charges extra.

Speaker 1  1:45:47
I actually really that is good, yeah, still don't think we need to mention go high level there, then we build exactly that for you. I I

Speaker 1  1:46:09
wouldn't even say none of the ones you don't, because they actually get all the features in jhL, whether they need them or not, we're just not charged. We're just not nickel and diming them. So I

Matthias Miller  1:47:00
I kind of like that. That's what it's leaning towards.

Speaker 1  1:47:16
Do you have a preference? I figured it's really exact process we use think so.

Unknown Speaker  1:47:28
Can you go back to the list again for a second?

Speaker 1  1:47:38
I like the here's how we do. What others say is impossible, but it's also very generic, meaning it doesn't address the what we're doing at all.

Unknown Speaker  1:47:46
Ah, I like this. Let's see this.

Unknown Speaker  1:47:54
Yeah, combine them or something. Yep, I

Unknown Speaker  1:48:21
There we go. I love it,

Unknown Speaker  1:48:26
yep, yep. Again.

Matthias Miller  1:48:34
3400 it's probably true. I don't know if I could completely defended if the FTC came after me, but

Unknown Speaker  1:48:45
Oh man,

Speaker 1  1:48:58
got a more specific, non rounded number.

Unknown Speaker  1:49:21
Three, two and A half,

Unknown Speaker  1:49:29
2708 3700

Unknown Speaker  1:49:38
i All right, I'm.

Unknown Speaker  1:50:13
Hang on, let's okay. Any comment? Have you read

Unknown Speaker  1:50:18
this right now? I

Unknown Speaker  1:50:28
I like it. No, no

Matthias Miller  1:50:29
critique. Okay, setting the stage is where magic happens. Build your entire setup. This is a strong statement, but I guess nobody else,

Speaker 1  1:50:45
okay, you can change that a little bit. Nobody else excels at the conversation migration the way we do, or something like that.

Unknown Speaker  1:51:00
We're the best. TM,

Matthias Miller  1:51:03
we're the best. TM, with Bee's Knees. Do you like it like this? Do you have a better

Speaker 1  1:51:11
I have one. This ESP is happening to me. Are we really revealing automation and workflow for 1000 bucks? Are we not even talking about No,

Matthias Miller  1:51:20
no, that's, that's probably 25 grand or so. I don't know 15

Speaker 1  1:51:24
or 20 nothing, nothing in this implies, or could be misconstrued that way.

Speaker 3  1:51:31
I hate, well, we haven't. We haven't.

Matthias Miller  1:51:38
There is no mention of $1,000 if you want just the conversation guard, then you can pay us for conversation guard.

Speaker 1  1:51:49
Okay, got it. This is the one page sales page, right? Totally, yep. Okay, yep. We just haven't told them what we're selling them yet. That's about,

Matthias Miller  1:51:58
sorry, this guy, migration readiness assessment. That's

Speaker 1  1:52:01
about, that's literally, what I was about to say, is that it's going to suggest that the way to get started, or the next thing to do is to do the $5 deal. Yeah, yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:52:11
Okay. This is just dumb. Let's

Speaker 1  1:52:16
we should, by the way, if this takes off at all, trademark, them all. Yep.

Matthias Miller  1:52:24
Okay, so then we're at seamless. Go live the moment of truth. We put your numbers to final data migration, flip your forms, get you operational, import your numbers, port your phone numbers. You

Unknown Speaker  1:52:43
to get the latest

Matthias Miller  1:52:59
does not usually happen overnight. I'm sorry.

Speaker 1  1:53:07
I think we should take all those time stuff and like all the the 24 hours and the zero downtime, and just say minimized or minimal, small as possible. I uh, all with little to no disruption, like, you know,

Speaker 1  1:53:31
disruption to your business, which is probably true is we probably could do the worst of it overnight if they're like, you know, trying to dodge between sales hours or something,

Matthias Miller  1:53:41
potentially. But you typically can't schedule porting. That's the big issue. I

Matthias Miller  1:54:05
this wasn't a migration, though.

Unknown Speaker  1:54:20
This guy, did? I?

Speaker 1  1:55:22
I'm I mean, that's like, I don't even have HubSpot, and I want to spend $5 to save 2000 right now,

Unknown Speaker  1:55:31
exactly,

Matthias Miller  1:55:37
We don't get nobody wants to get ready today. I I like that sweet. Now we got the one pager.

Unknown Speaker  1:55:48
You good? I love it, yeah. Okay,

Speaker 1  1:55:55
you got the one that one pager is in the folder, right? Yeah? New. Funnel, one beta got it.

Matthias Miller  1:56:18
Let me write all three for you. I

Speaker 1  1:56:40
Yours is so much better. We should totally test this. We should test everything under the sun. But I think that vo three video you made where the Secretary is like, saying, are you ready to pay your bill again?

Matthias Miller  1:56:53
Well, I mean, I would still put that hook at the front.

Unknown Speaker  1:56:58
Oh, I edit this immediately after, okay, yeah, I can see that. Yep, yep,

Matthias Miller  1:57:01
yep. I think this is better than the musk method.

Speaker 1  1:57:04
I don't I think the most method was just great, but let's test it all

Unknown Speaker  1:57:15
right.

Matthias Miller  1:57:20
Well, I mean, we can build everything else behind here, and then

Unknown Speaker  1:57:25
it totally Yep, yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:57:48
Okay, so this isn't quite right, but we can, I can clean it up so it's accurate. Now, they weren't paying 3200 they were paying more than that.

Matthias Miller  1:58:16
I wonder if I've got no i

Matthias Miller  1:58:24
I wonder if I can,

Unknown Speaker  1:58:28
if I've got billing history, account, billing

Unknown Speaker  1:58:34
transactions, there

Speaker 1  1:58:42
you go. I like the specificity and 20 cents and 14 cents and 56 cents, highly specific numbers.

Matthias Miller  1:59:00
Well, they were paying this every This is every quarter. Though, did I do the math wrong? I don't know. I

Matthias Miller  1:59:27
Oh, crumbs, I did that is nowhere near as impressive as it literally was three months and I thought this was a monthly rate,

Unknown Speaker  1:59:49
okay,

Matthias Miller  1:59:52
that changed the economics. But if we're selling it for 297 because that means we need to go back to the one pager. Okay?

Unknown Speaker  2:00:02
Because this wasn't

Unknown Speaker  2:00:12
they were at the

Matthias Miller  2:00:23
they had it no divided by times, or they were only paying 17 grand a year. And technically I am billing them out at nine Times, 7200 I

Matthias Miller  2:00:45
nine times 12 is 7200 so.

Speaker 1  2:01:07
Nine times 12. Nine 900 times 12. What are we actually doing?

Matthias Miller  2:01:16
I'm charging them 10,000 No, I mean, I guess if we would they were paying 17,036 17 236 17 236 and if we would take 297 times 12, then technically they would be Paying 13, 672, I

Matthias Miller  2:01:59
and 1002 1000.

Matthias Miller  2:02:05
It's really 7% is the minimum. Well, they're gonna have other costs anyway, including the business is bleeding.

Unknown Speaker  2:02:20
So we had said, we had said, it was the here, let's go backwards.

Matthias Miller  2:02:39
27 a month was actually 2700 divided by three, it was actually just $900 a month that they were completely wasting.

Matthias Miller  2:02:54
But it does mean it appeals to smaller size businesses, probably too. That's

Unknown Speaker  2:02:58
what I was thinking. Yep, I

Unknown Speaker  2:03:15
You still leave the 7000 I

Matthias Miller  2:03:52
certificate savings and

Unknown Speaker  2:04:03
set it,

Matthias Miller  2:04:14
then we can't charge a economics on A 15k migration really doesn't look quite that interesting. We can sell a guided migration for 5k and that's really easy to sell, like you get the readiness assessment and a few things thrown in, but you don't get workflows rebuilt. I

Unknown Speaker  2:04:44
uh, oh, that's a bummer.

Speaker 1  2:05:04
Yeah, and that's not just that one that you happen to open, right? That applies to all of them,

Matthias Miller  2:05:10
the all the companies. I don't have numbers on the other companies, okay?

Speaker 1  2:05:20
I'm sure there's more expensive versions of HubSpot as well. I

Unknown Speaker  2:05:55
Sorry. I'm

Matthias Miller  2:06:15
marketing hub, sales hub. I'm

Matthias Miller  2:06:34
10 to 50 most mid sized. I'm

Matthias Miller  2:06:48
I guess we could still say, up here, let me do all this stuff. Let's go back to where we were. I

Matthias Miller  2:06:59
don't know what do you think this is where we were for a mid sized company. This could actually be right.

Unknown Speaker  2:07:09
You could say this, oops,

Speaker 1  2:07:11
this meaning the original, or this meaning the lower priced one. The original for midsize company, the original is closer to right, yep.

Matthias Miller  2:07:22
So if we just say, you can be spending, including the business bleeding now, we haven't seen the business bleeding 40k per year. We've seen, um,

Matthias Miller  2:07:45
we haven't seen them bleeding that much on software. They not on HubSpot features, although it's implied we could do it as a multiple that looks more impressive. I

Unknown Speaker  2:08:01
um, like, literally,

Matthias Miller  2:08:18
literally, I think they negotiated a discount. That's why,

Unknown Speaker  2:08:25
if we would take the discount too, yeah,

Matthias Miller  2:08:34
but operation sub was completely unused, so 18. Okay, we do this is it, Team Plus 1360, 1361, three divided by 4309 73% i

Matthias Miller  2:09:03
What if we said that? Yep, I'm

Matthias Miller  2:09:26
okay, so this isn't right. You.

Matthias Miller  2:10:10
Okay, so if we go back here then, so we said, 2670 plus 750, plus, 1500 plus, 2400 is that? 7320 43 Oh, 9.2 divided by this so they negotiated a 41% discount. I

Unknown Speaker  2:10:57
How's that? Quite good.

Matthias Miller  2:11:17
50k I don't know it could be up To 5000 i, okay,

Matthias Miller  2:11:40
so Let's say that's Good. Now I'm

Unknown Speaker  2:12:37
okay, So they had The I

Matthias Miller  2:14:06
not true. Did not pay for itself before it started

Unknown Speaker  2:14:13
with this client.

Matthias Miller  2:14:18
We're not going to I'm

Unknown Speaker  2:15:03
That's good, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  2:15:10
Okay, So this is I'm

Unknown Speaker  2:16:02
You think of that.

Unknown Speaker  2:16:12
Love it, Yep, Yeah, Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  2:17:47
I thought I had A i

Speaker 3  2:18:30
No, you didn't That's not what I meant. I

Unknown Speaker  2:18:46
Come On, you.

Unknown Speaker  2:21:36
What is an artifact in that context?

Matthias Miller  2:21:38
It's Their it's their version of the canvas.

Matthias Miller  2:21:40
Let's just do this Your I the canvas. S. Okay, cool. It's like a docky document. Does chatbot straight into go high level. does. go higher level have a if more if we could just tie this chat bot. into go high level. Just kind of ask them questions, ask them Yes, ask them questions, and I'm this is very clearly copying from where they were, So that'll Be gracious. I This may be completely overkill, but then We'll go through and edit it and

Unknown Speaker  2:26:20
oh, this is going to be fun. That

Unknown Speaker  2:26:38
is really long,

Matthias Miller  2:26:41
yeah, what does it get into?

Matthias Miller  2:26:50
All right? Well, that's comprehensive. Now we get to

Unknown Speaker  2:26:57
hold it nine pages. I

Matthias Miller  2:28:20
I'm sorry, am I moving too fast? Nope, still reading, still good. What do you think about this question? I

Speaker 1  2:29:00
think it's fine. It introduces some doubt, like literally, plants the seed of doubt about their current situation, which is probably good.

Matthias Miller  2:29:19
Actually, these might be unnecessary, But we should have a i

Matthias Miller  2:29:48
These should need numbers to make it easier for people. I.

Matthias Miller  2:30:48
Okay, so do we want to I have gotten other quotes from other companies doing CRM migration within the Shit industry that they're charging 10 to 15k okay,

Matthias Miller  2:31:06
but we could say, Well, okay, but then if I just find it, if somebody saves $500 a month, well, then that's 30 months. I

Speaker 3  2:31:23
uh, that's just not

Matthias Miller  2:31:30
compelling in my mind. I I thought, obviously this is, this is such a dumb but somewhat typical mistake, the economics are way different than what I thought, and I'm less convinced it's about money, and I think it's more about control and customizability and AI and keeping up with the Joneses. And,

Speaker 1  2:32:02
yeah, you're just saying you want to not stop appealing solely to money and appeal to some other things too.

Matthias Miller  2:32:09
I mean, I think we kind of need,

Unknown Speaker  2:32:12
okay. What do you think?

Matthias Miller  2:32:22
No, until Okay, let's say if, if somebody's paying 3000 a month, yep, that's that's 3000 that's five months. That's great, and maybe we're just appealing to those people.

Unknown Speaker  2:32:37
I don't have any problem with that at All. I

Matthias Miller  2:32:49
What's the basis for saying this? I

Speaker 1  2:33:04
trying to make you feel like a slacker and get you to get with it.

Matthias Miller  2:33:10
The assumption is that if you're not Using GHL, you're in The bottom 20% I

Unknown Speaker  2:34:15
We don't Know. I

Matthias Miller  2:35:06
Do we want to is there a cut off point where we don't want to talk to them if they're not saving

Speaker 1  2:35:14
Not, not for the basic migration, that's fair we would have, I mean, if we literally can't save them money, okay, but if we can save them even 100 bucks and getting paid $1,000 to do so, why not?

Matthias Miller  2:35:33
Well, I mean, migration pays for itself. I mean, I think you could say Converse conversation guard pays for itself in

Matthias Miller  2:35:55
as little as if they just do the advisory Man, if I could sell, if I could, if I could sell, I could sell a stack of advisories, like, if I could sell as little as five to 10 advisories a month, I'd be quite pleased.

Unknown Speaker  2:36:20
Sorry, which one you call it the advisory. The advisory

Matthias Miller  2:36:22
is just where look. We'll be the expert support. You guys do all the grunt work. We're just here to guide you through the process so you don't screw things up. So it's conversation guard, plus, don't screw it up, but you do all The work. Okay? Um,

Matthias Miller  2:36:50
okay, that makes economics work. I'm

Speaker 1  2:37:05
I mean, another way to look at this, if we're just talking about money and income, on our side, is every customer you add, you're stacking recurring revenue, and you're by charging to do the migration, you're practically getting paid to acquire a customer. Yep. Obviously that doesn't change the fact that they need to be saving money on their side in order for to have incentive. But I think that's a self solving problem.

Speaker 2  2:37:36
Yeah. I I

Matthias Miller  2:38:02
don't it's a little tough to say they're likely using, using these. I'd be inclined to nix this, but

Speaker 1  2:38:17
this is still the assessment. No, I think it's a great question, because actually, we're going to filter them out if they're using that fancy stuff,

Matthias Miller  2:38:27
do you do you use, but you're you're not necessarily paying for them? Do you just use any of these premium features?

Unknown Speaker  2:38:35
That would be true.

Unknown Speaker  2:38:41
So

Unknown Speaker  2:39:00
what was the wording on 13 before you changed it?

Unknown Speaker  2:39:05
The step?

Speaker 1  2:39:07
Oh, okay, I get it's all car. I got. Never mind, yeah, and what

Matthias Miller  2:39:18
I want to do is I want to put this in chat based or something where I can review people's conversations and then improve it, yep, if there are flaws, yep.

Unknown Speaker  2:39:34
I love the accidental enterprise.

Matthias Miller  2:39:41
Okay, 14,

Speaker 3  2:39:44
1516, I'm.

Unknown Speaker  2:42:30
1617,

Unknown Speaker  2:42:34
18. I'm

Matthias Miller  2:47:09
Less than how spot charges you Every two hours.

Unknown Speaker  2:47:15
I love it.

Unknown Speaker  2:47:15
Oh, we don't apply. We don't allow markdown, just i. I love it. I Don't lose some people with this type of language. I'm 12. My numbers are off, 1818, 2021, it's a lot of steps. There's a lot of steps. Um, I guess we'll be able to see if we lose people, though, should be okay, but you are at the chat bot. Let's try this file download as a markdown. I'm Says it'll take a doc.

Matthias Miller  2:50:05
That's fair. I should have just put in a doc.

Unknown Speaker  2:50:08
I've got a text file.

Unknown Speaker  2:50:18
Okay? I

Matthias Miller  2:50:26
I thought I just told you to create a new agent.

Unknown Speaker  2:50:30
Here it is, create agent.

Unknown Speaker  2:50:37
Well, that's fast. That try this.

Unknown Speaker  2:50:50
More like,

Matthias Miller  2:50:59
Okay, but

Unknown Speaker  2:51:07
how do I

Unknown Speaker  2:51:21
sources, I don't need this source anymore.

Unknown Speaker  2:51:30
This guy, I'm

Unknown Speaker  2:52:11
smart. I'm

Unknown Speaker  2:52:23
I would be gracious.

Speaker 1  2:52:41
Strikes me that starting with name, collection and revenue collection at the beginning is a bad idea.

Unknown Speaker  2:52:52
Key starts with name. Okay,

Matthias Miller  2:52:56
we're not asking for revenue yet.

Speaker 1  2:53:01
I Sorry, that was an odd way to say that. But what I mean is the second question was asking how much They were spending, right? I

Matthias Miller  2:54:31
so this is where you really should be so asking how much you're paying.

Speaker 1  2:54:36
Probably so, and we also could deduce that from their answer to these questions, anyway, true. I.

Unknown Speaker  2:55:18
I meant to Say I'm

Unknown Speaker  2:56:00
what's one of having that revenue question at all?

Matthias Miller  2:56:25
Yeah, I don't even know.

Unknown Speaker  2:56:37
Okay, so you would put i

Speaker 1  2:56:48
i would prefer to say anything that makes the user feel like they're in the right place, and this is going well before asking their name. I could be wrong about that, but that's kind of an old standing ask method principle that you don't start off trying to collect name, phone, email, so on and so forth. At the beginning, you just kind of get right to it, and then it's kind of a universal marketing principle that people don't like to answer money questions, especially early on, because they feel like, oh, he just wants to know how much money I spend so he can charge me more, right?

Matthias Miller  2:57:26
So this really should be, is there any reason not to use this interface for the chat?

Unknown Speaker  2:57:32
No, I like it. Okay,

Matthias Miller  2:57:34
it's an app. It's an app. Sumo deal.

Speaker 1  2:57:37
I've actually seen it and maybe even bought it, but never used it.

Unknown Speaker  2:57:53
And I wonder if I

Matthias Miller  2:58:08
Okay, so then here we start with that.

Matthias Miller  2:58:19
How about we mix these two paragraphs and just get straight to the point.

Unknown Speaker  2:58:27
Do you think

Unknown Speaker  2:58:33
like that? Yep, yep, okay, so do. Let's go.

Unknown Speaker  2:58:46
Okay, so then we're going to do,

Speaker 1  2:59:00
see, that's that's a great opener. In my opinion, there's like no pressure is also not fully expected.

Unknown Speaker  2:59:10
Seems great.

Unknown Speaker  2:59:16
Okay, so

Matthias Miller  2:59:19
I would actually do isn't pain point better than the triggers.

Unknown Speaker  2:59:31
No strong opinion either way, it probably is good to have pain point first. I

Speaker 1  3:00:02
Regarding the name thing, yeah, they they've paid before they get here, right? Yeah, can their name be passed as a dynamic variable? Somehow,

Matthias Miller  3:00:13
I have no idea. I

Speaker 1  3:01:13
20 messages every 240 seconds. That's actually quite a limit. It's not a bit tight. 20 a minute would be reasonable.

Unknown Speaker  3:01:28
Sure it's

Matthias Miller  3:01:31
every three seconds that's fine.

Speaker 1  3:01:39
Say, Whoa, there. Partner, yeah, can you slow down? Isn't

Matthias Miller  3:01:52
it weird how

Matthias Miller  3:01:59
you AI is supposed to make people talk in a more natural language. And it's still so not okay. I don't know if you can there's a contacts thing. I don't know what that is. Oh, that's after they fill it out. I

Speaker 2  3:02:20
real

Speaker 1  3:02:24
quick. Let's look at contacts. That's only after they fill it out. Man, what's with all the bugs?

Matthias Miller  3:02:32
Well, it's a one time. It's a lifetime offer. So you know, I

Matthias Miller  3:02:42
Okay, so let's go Back to this. I'm

Unknown Speaker  3:03:21
now these should be split out.

Matthias Miller  3:03:30
So you're thinking, we should ask for these things

Unknown Speaker  3:03:36
separately, literally, one question at A time I

Matthias Miller  3:05:15
Okay, this is going to take a little bit, might drop for a few minutes While this runs,

Unknown Speaker  3:05:22
Yep, I'll Be back A Few Yep,

Matthias Miller  3:08:47
well, five minutes to put together a plan seems fairly aggressive, but

Speaker 1  3:08:57
I would almost say that it's stuck, or else it is really, actually crawling the web. I

Unknown Speaker  3:09:04
mean, I think it is

Unknown Speaker  3:09:07
under 90s, also aggressive.

Unknown Speaker  3:09:11
Is aggressive.

Matthias Miller  3:09:13
Never actually, I've never had it get stuck.

Speaker 2  3:09:20
Oddly, I I

Speaker 1  3:09:25
did have a situation like this, just one time with chat GPT, and I literally said something like, are you still there? And it woke up like it actually started talking again. I

Unknown Speaker  3:10:24
Type I'm that's so Bizarre.

Unknown Speaker  3:11:22
Yes, there's no hope for it. Let's let it run.

Unknown Speaker  3:11:24
Just let it run. I suppose, put

Unknown Speaker  3:11:40
them against each other. You

Unknown Speaker  3:12:25
Well, I

Matthias Miller  3:12:27
might, you might have actually wanted a complete breakdown so that you could use it for features to use or don't Use. Hey, I

Matthias Miller  3:14:31
Okay? Well, it is writing and citing report now, so there's that maybe it wouldn't even have required research mode. I.

Matthias Miller  3:15:37
See, I'm not sure if people actually are going to know this. I'm

Matthias Miller  3:15:48
seems like it's almost easier to let them spitball a monthly number. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  3:15:56
am I wrong?

Speaker 1  3:16:00
No, I like the I like the tip there on number six, typical Pro, 3000 enterprise, 7000 that helps. It's 5.6 which is weird.

Unknown Speaker  3:16:18
That would be helpful for them, if they like, don't know, but they it just jogs their memory. In other words,

Matthias Miller  3:16:34
okay, cloud research as well, As he says, completed. I

Unknown Speaker  3:16:45
on set completed. I'm

Matthias Miller  3:17:41
Well, I mean, here is this. I don't

Matthias Miller  3:17:52
know this looks extremely overwhelming. It feels like it's complicated.

Speaker 1  3:17:57
I agree i was i How would this actually get utilized? It's almost like it's its own separate prompts. Now, well,

Matthias Miller  3:18:10
I mean, if you want to not ask them their monthly fee, i

Matthias Miller  3:18:27
This seems really weird this early, actually, this seems like something after you run feasibility.

Unknown Speaker  3:18:35
I Yep, I agree. I

Matthias Miller  3:18:44
um, okay, so we have this, you have the pain point. Then you say, just so I can run some numbers and

Speaker 3  3:19:05
234, let's see. This is where, like, this doesn't matter. None of these questions matter.

Speaker 1  3:19:18
I'm definitely all for shortening it, I I do think that one about which plan are you on is, yeah, how could they not matter when we're supposedly doing an assessment like every one of those things is stacking up the core cost, which, at the end of the day, we're trying to save them cost. Mm,

Matthias Miller  3:19:53
well, in this case, we can ask them about their use, and we can defer their Yeah. I like, Okay, here's what I like about it. It lets us put the

Matthias Miller  3:20:17
here's what I really like about it. These are stupid, simple, non threatening questions. I think

Unknown Speaker  3:20:25
I agree. I

Speaker 3  3:20:27
agree for five

Speaker 1  3:20:32
place to ask for a name would be right after team members, and it would be easy to turn it into a joke. Does that include you? Oh, by the way, what's your name yourself?

Matthias Miller  3:20:51
And you would just say, would you put it into one question?

Unknown Speaker  3:21:01
You explain I,

Speaker 1  3:21:04
I was, I was in church. Okay, you know what? Yeah, great. That's very logical. Yes, does that include you? Yes, no, by the way, what is your name? That's that is great. That's one of the nicest segues on that kind of question I've ever seen. Um,

Matthias Miller  3:21:19
you're almost as encouraging as chatgpt or plot. Yeah,

Speaker 3  3:22:24
should these go earlier years of conversation history?

Speaker 1  3:22:31
No, they actually, to me, they segue pretty nicely into a pain point, because now they're thinking, Now they'll start to think, not just like, Oh, I'm on the Pro Plan, which is a nice vanilla question, but more like, oh, wow, I've got a million things in here to save. Okay, but, yeah, it feeds into the readiness to act idea very well. I think I

Matthias Miller  3:23:00
I don't like to sting a little.

Unknown Speaker  3:23:16
I agree with that. Yep, I

Speaker 1  3:23:28
or let me ask you a question that this is this is not great, but basically that might trigger a fresh insight for you. There's probably a better way to say that. But like changing angles here, let me ask you something that you may not have thought of before, right? Like, that's not quite it, but

Matthias Miller  3:23:51
I like the idea of Just you might not have the answer.

Unknown Speaker  3:23:55
That's fine. I

Matthias Miller  3:24:20
Well, this is definitely more than the 20 minutes that

Unknown Speaker  3:24:39
Caleb advertised. Oh, that's

Unknown Speaker  3:24:41
always the case. And actually, I think this is going pretty well. I'm not complaining, courtesy of your expertise on these things,

Unknown Speaker  3:24:52
all right. Oh, we took it

Matthias Miller  3:24:55
all right. Download, markdown. I.

Unknown Speaker  3:25:09
Jet base. Here we come. All right, playground,

Unknown Speaker  3:25:20
yes, let's go.

Matthias Miller  3:25:23
It's your current ability. Just, Oh, you are kidding me. What did you

Speaker 1  3:25:26
do? Um, didn't run it through the markdown process from the new or didn't paste correctly.

Unknown Speaker  3:25:36
It's pasted right? I

Unknown Speaker  3:25:46
It's like it's cashed.

Matthias Miller  3:26:02
Okay? Let's go here. Let's refresh this.

Unknown Speaker  3:26:10
What

Speaker 1  3:26:12
can you delete it and start a new one? Copy it and start a new one. System prompt, Custom Prompt. Create agent.

Speaker 3  3:26:29
Ai, there's the Custom Prompt,

Unknown Speaker  3:26:41
712, 12

Matthias Miller  3:26:45
automatically retrains every 24 hours and checks for the latest

Unknown Speaker  3:26:50
update. Oh, come on.

Unknown Speaker  3:26:54
I'm almost certain the fastest thing to do is to do a new one. Yep, it's the PMM v2

Unknown Speaker  3:27:05
I don't have sources. Text. I

Matthias Miller  3:27:28
at your sources. I'm trying to if you would make it difficult.

Speaker 1  3:27:34
There you go, training in progress. Well, that's a nightmare that you can't edit live. What a massive bug.

Matthias Miller  3:27:46
Well, it's not a bug, it's a limitation. They want you to upgrade to

Unknown Speaker  3:27:51
pro, Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  3:27:53
Okay, so

Matthias Miller  3:27:59
free And my Friends, you

Matthias Miller  3:29:07
it should not be nice to Meet you just a God of Matthias I

Unknown Speaker  3:31:08
I like that

Matthias Miller  3:31:10
pays for itself in about 12 months. I

Speaker 1  3:31:14
don't know where that math is coming from, but I Like, like where it's going with that whole conversation. I

Speaker 1  3:32:03
just say, typically pays for itself in a month or two, or, you know, less than a quarter, just something that minimizes the

Unknown Speaker  3:32:16
yep, I

Matthias Miller  3:32:25
but even this is just wrong, the 5000 like, that's two months, 2500 what?

Matthias Miller  3:32:40
What if we took that? I think that just AI is getting it confused.

Speaker 1  3:32:47
I think so, because it's got some kind of, like formulaic stuff, and it's trying to maybe subtraction or something, or something. Yeah, I

Unknown Speaker  3:33:09
this question here is, I'm

Unknown Speaker  3:33:35
could we just i?

Speaker 3  3:33:54
We can we just merge these Two together? Sure? I

Unknown Speaker  3:34:11
Hey, I'm

Speaker 1  3:37:19
basically. other thing that's missing is kind of the i info. Okay, so the main other main thing that's missing is kind of the. Here's the thing. I'm not sure about. thing that's missing is kind of the. As long as we get info. But he didn't actually. here's the thing I'm not sure About i Here's the that that goes off somewhere that goes? Well, we need a different call to action at the end, like it's trying to set an appointment, but I'm not even sure we should show I think, I don't think we should show investment options. I think we should book a call or start a converse, a messenger conversation. So I'm guessing Caleb did not address this. So if you think about it, what you're building here, the chat bot is the product. It's so Caleb's funnel ends with the one page sales letter, and we're selling them the $5 product. The product is the AI tool for five bucks. Did you go through his own AI tool, and did it end with that? CTA? Is that what you're saying? I think so I can go pull up the history. And so we probably should like it makes sense to then say, If all this, you know, if saving XYZ a month sounds good to you, you tell me what you want, but you know, the next step is to let us know, and we can outline your migration blueprint for you, or, you know, basically, like, get in contact with us again, and we can get you started. Yeah. Hang

Matthias Miller  3:40:25
on. I'm trying to get a free delivery here. All good. I

Matthias Miller  3:40:46
literally have flash flood warnings. This is crazy in Colorado, like, literally, like, I'm on Main Street and there's like, a foot of water.

Speaker 1  3:40:59
Wow, that's rare up in the woods. Yeah, it is so much weird weather lately. I'm sure you've heard about all that flooding in Texas, West Texas and all that. Yeah, I have a client in a lot.

Matthias Miller  3:41:15
He said, he said, it's never been this green.

Speaker 1  3:41:21
Yeah, I know people in lot. Who do you know a lot? Uh, Mark, Mark

Matthias Miller  3:41:26
Miller, I think, okay, I don't know him in particular, as a shed company. My boss, Dan, Dan lived there, really,

Unknown Speaker  3:41:35
I knew, Oh, what was his name? Bishop Andy. I've forgotten his last name.

Matthias Miller  3:41:50
My boss would have been with the you would have been

Unknown Speaker  3:41:54
Baptist, if you know any.

Speaker 1  3:41:58
No, just submit. Just some Mennonite folks from there.

Unknown Speaker  3:42:01
Okay, yeah, I don't

Matthias Miller  3:42:05
know that. All right, so we're gonna meet in the back.

Unknown Speaker  3:42:11
Mullet. That's what it was. Andy mullet. Does that ring any bells? I

Matthias Miller  3:42:14
mean, it sounds like a good minute a name, but that doesn't

Speaker 2  3:42:19
that's great. I All

Matthias Miller  3:42:32
right, right on. Talk about crazy Rain Man, everyone you

Matthias Miller  3:42:48
great.

Unknown Speaker  3:42:52
So let me go pull up

Unknown Speaker  3:42:56
this document here. I'm

Unknown Speaker  3:43:04
I had a

Unknown Speaker  3:43:11
no not that i

Unknown Speaker  3:43:25
Here we go.

Unknown Speaker  3:43:31
Trial offer.

Speaker 1  3:43:40
So, yeah, yeah, okay, good, good, good. Can you go back down to the bottom? So, literally, next steps. Basically, this is what you're gonna do. And then, in his case, he's saying, like, that's an upsell, right, right? Basically, here's what you should do, or pay me to do it. So this is where you would do, probably the classic, hang on. I think I have a total solution to this problem, but give me 99 and a half seconds to go hunt through a bunch of PDFs.

Matthias Miller  3:44:15
You need a bot train on your Oh,

Speaker 1  3:44:18
man, I have so much stuff, but I think I, I'm almost certain I know exactly where this is freedom multiplier, either, right one, I want that blue brute blueprint,

Unknown Speaker  3:44:30
um, I

Speaker 1  3:45:08
Hey, that's not a good one. Consulting book is almost same thing, but it's at longer i

Unknown Speaker  3:46:04
Okay, not quite what I thought.

Speaker 1  3:46:12
Let you know that's email swipes. Let's see here. I

Speaker 1  3:46:37
Okay, so I thought I knew exactly where this was in a Frank Kern swipe. But I'm a little bit wrong. I guarantee this must be one of those things where I've seen it everywhere. So basically this close is, and you can probably ask chat GPT to help you put this together, but essentially hanging on my wallet, like, basically, it's like, okay, so you, you know, this is awesome. We have figured out how to save you all this money. Does that sound good to you or, like, are you ready to do this? And when they say yes, you say, you know, and, and Matthias, I'm just making suggestions. There's, there might be better ways to do this, but basically, like, okay, so you can go, you know, do this all yourself, but we are the experts at this, and we have the system and the skill ready to get this done. Do you want to, you know, do you want us to contact you to, you know, get the ball rolling, or outline the blueprint, or, you know, get it started, basically, and you don't, I'm of the opinion that you don't have to say anything about the price or whatever there on the close just like by can. All you need to do is convince them that, yes, I really do want to start saving $1,200 a month. What do I do next? And basically it's, we're going to contact You with the plan For phone

Speaker 3  3:48:19
Number You

Speaker 1  3:52:07
Here's a good one, John Carlton. Here's what to do next. Go to John carlton.com buy everything for sale on that page. Help others And tell Your Friends You Here's a good one. John Carlton, here's what to do next go to John carlton.com, by everything for sale on that page, help brothers and tell your friends. Here's a good one. John Carlton, here's what to do next go to John carlton.com, by everything for sale on that page, help brothers and tell your friends.

Unknown Speaker  3:56:40
I am cannot find what I'm looking for anywhere. Are you still able to hear me? I cannot hear you.

Unknown Speaker  3:56:53
See if I got

Unknown Speaker  3:57:01
Or So, this is where, and I can't believe I can't find this. I've seen this a million times. So basically the idea would be that right before your step 20, you. talk it through and get pretty close. Is there. disconnected during. all my wondering around. I wonder I wonder if. a way, maybe we could talk it through and get pretty close. Is there a way can we just is it too likely to lose Okay? Can we ask them to confirm their phone number without getting suspicious, or without raising or should we just ask them? Say, look, do we tell them to text us? I would. And then I maybe, yeah, what's your phone number? And then, like, just, you know, I Well, let's see Yep. No, I want to say, just so we know We have the right one on file. And then, how about back to this conversation instead of back to your purchase? Right? I How's that? Sure? Yeah, it's great. And then do you, I mean, is it? Is it, basically? And it's like, Hey, look. So give the phone number, then what happens next? Do they do? Do. We give them something they can do if they want to. Say something like

Speaker 1  4:00:09
in essence, so you can go do all this yourself, and you got a busy schedule, and you know it's gonna take you 15 months to get around to it and La, la, or you can hire us to do it for you. Make sense, like in a nutshell, it's the classic. You can do all this yourself, or we can do it for you. You're busy. We're the experts. You

Speaker 1  4:00:48
and then, to make that even better, see if you're if you're an ad agency, you rattle off the 5900 steps to actually build this campaign. And then you say what I said, knowing that nobody wants to do the work. That's still true here. They don't want to do the work of researching and learning how to migrate to DHL. I'm just not sure how we would stick that in there briefly, as they like. So here's what needs to be done, right? Because, because the assessment was a readiness assessment, not a blueprinting session.

Speaker 1  4:01:29
Maybe, maybe we should move that whole idea off to the blueprinting session itself. I'm definitely not trying to create a longer funnel or more friction, but interesting

Unknown Speaker  4:02:00
that it's reworking the entire thing from the Top down.

Matthias Miller  4:02:05
Yeah, it's getting a little i

Speaker 1  4:02:30
Oh, I don't know that it needs to be I mean, that that's totally true, but my goodness, it's like 50 feet long. When I was thinking of one pair, exactly, I right? This is totally the right idea.

Unknown Speaker  4:02:52
It's just too much. I

Matthias Miller  4:05:27
Um, I'm and then it's just like a I think

Matthias Miller  4:06:01
it can be just this simple. I

Unknown Speaker  4:06:32
reach out to you. Okay, applause,

Unknown Speaker  4:06:46
that's great. That pre frames the text, yep, I'm

Speaker 1  4:07:16
how's that? It's great. And I would add one more, like, yeah, we're just scrapping all that. So I would just that you Okay.

Speaker 1  4:07:40
Is there any question? Is that good to restart the conversation after we closed it, not really. If there was any other questions I would i

Speaker 1  4:08:05
Is that too aggressive power movement can call the movement that's fine. I was going to say, if you're going to ask for any other questions, I would put it above the phone number request. So the only other thing that I would do is, after they say, It's okay if we text, that's very passive and it's good, it gets their permission and La, la, la. But what might make you punchier would be to say something like, you know, if you or if you want to reach out right now, send me a text and give your phone number that also will help them recognize that number when it i i would keep the is it okay we text because they're overtly agreeing to move forward with the conversation. But then, like,

Matthias Miller  4:08:58
great, well, how about this? Great, if you want, if you want to jump ahead in line, feel free to shoot us a text right now. Text right now. At 719, I don't know my number.

Unknown Speaker  4:09:18
43071024, 7102,

Speaker 1  4:09:29
yeah, I love that. And that allows anybody who's, like, really into it and in the mood to, like, just call or text you up on the spot without this kind of ambiguous, you know, any, because that goes it feels like, sorry, go ahead,

Matthias Miller  4:09:45
even if it's even if I even if nobody reaches out it. It gives them a sense of control, like I can reach this guy, yep. Okay, well, so now we have v3 E, are we good to just, do we need to run another round through the chat? Or do we call it good?

Speaker 1  4:10:08
Add a page break in there, if you don't mind. Just for fun, and then, let's just scan it, eyeball it real quick. Okay, so that's Yeah, got it. So first things first. I love that, yep, makes sense. La, la. Subscription level, very nice, yep, uh huh, and your name, yep. Pain point. I love that biggest frustration, that kind of pre frames that it's frustrating, can run some numbers. Maybe understand and use frequently, yes that line, but the middle

Speaker 1  4:10:55
of it, excuse me, yeah, that's all good. I I actually use weekly. I love that. Yep, the step 11 helps you filter out somebody who really, actually might need to stay with HubSpot. So that's good. Got extra capital low in your step 12 conversations in your Colorado conversation, oh, exactly how many years that that is, twist the knife, right there. I like it. That's good, yep. And you're paying extra for all that. And then, you know, here's your potential. Yeah, getting to the point already I like that,

Matthias Miller  4:11:42
but new monthly cost is Four and 297

Speaker 1  4:11:51
yep, I see zero reason to repeat 297 within one inch of each other. Just jump straight to monthly savings, yeah, just like that. All right, you

Matthias Miller  4:12:24
this is a hard to read sense.

Speaker 1  4:12:26
I'm not there yet, getting there almost. If you've discovered your subsidizing HubSpot yacht parties, I love it.

Speaker 1  4:12:41
Yeah, there you go, peer, trigger peer. You might not have the answer. How do you think your CRM costs compared to similar businesses in your network?

Matthias Miller  4:12:50
How about to your competitors? It's not peers. But

Speaker 1  4:13:00
that's good. I like it, yep. And when innovative leaders in your industry makes, I think that's almost useless. It's attempting to on the Travis Sego, what is his famous acronym for his 12 things that you have to put in your offer, timer, right out of timer. This is somehow related to like identity or tribe or something, but it just feels kind of, maybe it's

Matthias Miller  4:13:34
good as a leader. It's trying to tap into identity as a leader.

Speaker 1  4:13:42
I don't think we need it. What do I know? The shocking revelation of seeing a clear pattern we can call an accidental enterprise. I love that accidental enterprise. User did chat? GPT, come up with that? Claude, yeah, that is really quite good, yeah, yeah, thank you for the Oh.

Matthias Miller  4:14:20
Like, can we just make it sound complicated? Phone lines, ATP, ATP, automation, configuration, conversion history, and that's just getting started,

Speaker 1  4:14:55
I love it and the light and the load. Question is. Is the terribly simple, wonderfully simple version of what I said anyway, because it implies that somebody or something else is going to lighten that load.

Matthias Miller  4:15:12
What if we sit Okay, let's chat about or is it just literally, are you open to ways looking at okay, what's your phone number? Do you just say, in that case we need to talk, or do you just literally go into you've been looking at least Yes.

Speaker 1  4:15:34
So it's a great question. I am inclined to go ahead and say like we can roll out a blueprint for you,

Unknown Speaker  4:15:42
what's your phone number.

Unknown Speaker  4:15:52
Okay,

Matthias Miller  4:15:54
here's what's next. We're going to read through this conversation and reach out to you

Unknown Speaker  4:16:00
to go over, to go over.

Matthias Miller  4:16:04
Lou Brent, is it okay if I text first text before I call? Most people want that. Great. Also. You want to jump headline? Shoot us a text right now.

Unknown Speaker  4:16:29
Good now, dun,

Matthias Miller  4:16:32
dun, dun,

Unknown Speaker  4:16:56
okay, good,

Matthias Miller  4:16:59
lucky, not good.

Unknown Speaker  4:17:02
I should show you this.

Matthias Miller  4:17:05
This is, this is, can I take the chance for a rabbit trail?

Speaker 1  4:17:09
Yeah, always, that's a good way to blow off steam.

Unknown Speaker  4:17:16
So I

Speaker 2  4:17:25
no this one. No, this one, this one. Fire psychology expert, I want to

Matthias Miller  4:17:30
understand the true emotional identity level reason why high level client would invest in a high end round table, slash mastermind by Perry Marshall, go five layers deep, start with a typical surface level and peel back each layer was trying to purchase, subconsciously, fear, desire, safety, belonging, identity protection or legacy. Plot twist fires me the real purchase. You're not buying marketing strategies. You're buying identity insurance. You're purchasing proof that you're still climbing, still worthy, still special. It's a talisman against the imposter syndrome that successful people rarely admit to, but always universally feel. The Mastermind. Is your way of saying, I belong here, not to others, but to yourself.

Speaker 1  4:18:04
Ah, cheesy. Do you like that?

Matthias Miller  4:18:08
Don't you think it's still true?

Speaker 1  4:18:11
It will be true for certain people. I have no idea if it's true for you. Does it resonate?

Matthias Miller  4:18:21
It made me think I've given thought to what I actually get out of roundtable, because it's, it really is two things, I think I derive a fairly strong sense. Perry is very I know, I know some people talk about the group of the types of people he curates, which is good, but I actually think I derive more of a sense of identity from my relationship with Perry and who He is then, and certainly he's helped with star principle and other stuff like that. I don't feel like McGee has given good I've never been happy with his marketing advice. I mean, it's felt really it felt like it makes sense on the surface. It just doesn't land for me. Bob rignares is supposedly a resource, but I have no idea how to use him. And he's moving out of, you know, and he's moving into coaching, and that's what you pay him for. And all the peers are wonderful people. There's lots of high energy, really great caliber people, and they come back really motivated from it, which I love. But they're all ideas people, and they're always telling me what I could be doing differently, which is the last thing that I need. I don't need more I like, let me ask you this, from what you know of me, do I need another idea?

Unknown Speaker  4:19:47
No, definitely, not

Matthias Miller  4:19:50
exactly. And so I feel like there's a sense of, there is a sense of identity and groundedness that I get with Perry. I don't know if it's have. Arrived or got it. I don't know how else to describe it. I just, when I'm sounds kind of weird. When I'm when I'm around him, I just, I feel more at home, I feel more grounded, I feel more at peace, I feel more whole. I feel feel like I make I feel it feels more like the world makes sense, and that probably is the nucleus of why I'm in Round Table.

Unknown Speaker  4:20:22
Access to Perry, access to Perry.

Matthias Miller  4:20:26
It's an expensive relationship.

Unknown Speaker  4:20:33
Anyway, you know

Speaker 1  4:20:36
that's funny. I just had about 30 things go through my head with regards I did I get this from Glenn Livingston or Dean Jackson or somebody like that, somewhere a million years ago, somebody was bringing up the idea of why people pay for a recurring membership to something, I think, I think it was a tiny membership that Glenn ran for a while. And some pay for membership, and then, apparently, don't use it, right? Don't come to the calls, don't use the forum. Blah, blah, blah. And, you know, there's this tendency in the whole internet marketing space to look down on people who pay for and don't use the resources. And there is some valid stuff there, like it's it's real. And I know a guy that will not sell info products, and I asked him about it once, and he literally said, because I know people need a solution. They're buying it because they, thanks to the marketing, they think it's a solution and it's an impulse buy, but they really probably should have spent that same 20 bucks on, you know, whatever, a bottle of vitamins or something else. And we all know why they bought it, and they're never going to use it, and then that PDF is going to sit on their their hard drive unused forever. And he literally said, When I die and stand before my maker, I don't, I don't want to be responsible for having done that to people which, which is pretty awesome, by the way. But on the flip side, somebody, I think it was in Livingston, said they brought up this idea, like, why are people paying a recurring membership fee and then not coming to the calls or whatever, and somebody said it's because they want to have the potential access to you. And upon thinking about it, that is literally why I have continued to pay for anything I've ever continued to pay for it is literally to keep my spot in line so that if I want to post something to the new renaissance group or Perry's forum day or whatever, I can, at least in theory, if the door is open to me, right, for whatever all that was worth.

Unknown Speaker  4:22:55
I

Matthias Miller  4:22:58
I like that. And I think I mean, we can also use that to my I remember the first time I emailed you about a tracking problem for true point. I think, cool. And at that point, like, I've, I've, I've broken down every barrier to being able to contact you, but you were the busy guru sitting on the top of the top of the mountain that was impossible to reach and expensive to talk to.

Unknown Speaker  4:23:24
Are you serious? Yeah?

Matthias Miller  4:23:27
Me, yeah. Bright brothers, you were the guy who was always too busy to show up to the calls. You were the one naming rates higher than I was willing to name.

Speaker 1  4:23:40
That's fascinating, absolutely fascinating. No, I'm the low life rascal who can't get a grip and already always has his hair on fire, and probably not a good enough reason for the fire.

Matthias Miller  4:23:55
That's a funny picture. Yeah,

Speaker 1  4:23:57
that's that is just awesome that it looked that way. I did not try to do that, by the way. I

Matthias Miller  4:24:04
just assumed it was intentional. No,

Speaker 1  4:24:07
totally not intentional. It's more. It's more like a sign of an out of control life.

Unknown Speaker  4:24:14
Fair,

Speaker 1  4:24:15
that's that is, I can't wait to tell my wife that later. That's great.

Matthias Miller  4:24:21
All right, so let's to, let's try to recreate this thing with the right settings. Dashboard, new AI agent.

Speaker 1  4:24:29
It's really, yeah. It is really fascinating how people see themselves versus how other people see them. Now I want to, there's a there's a young fellow in my church who's the son of a minister who I have massive respect for. I'm talking about for the son. And he said something in church the other day that like it never he's a great kid. The whole family is great. Every everybody's totally awesome. And he said something in church the other day that made. Think, like, Oh, wow. He doesn't know that the rest of us think he's awesome.

Matthias Miller  4:25:04
Yeah, you know, I've thought about that. I really feel like I have a friend of mine who actually offered this is like, I have good friends. I don't anyway, that's, that's just true friend of mine who's like, you know what? You're so awesome. I never think to tell you. I'm going to put a reminder on my phone to tell you every month how awesome you are. That's great. I'm like, good gracious. How do you get friends like that? Okay, so it has to be 50 characters. So I'm creating a 50 space document because I don't need any knowledge in here. But it's being too stupid to it's being too stupid.

Matthias Miller  4:25:49
So we have this Custom Prompt of this.

Unknown Speaker  4:25:54
We have this guy, download. Down,

Matthias Miller  4:26:07
well, then you're gonna have to I think that's also one of my weird quirks. I am constantly fascinated, but we'll never ask people constantly fascinated, how people see me and experience me, but will rarely actually ask people that all

Unknown Speaker  4:26:24
right? So we have Settings General.

Matthias Miller  4:26:30
We've got

Unknown Speaker  4:26:33
general

Matthias Miller  4:26:36
power move, migration.

Speaker 2  4:26:39
Sky's toast. I'm credit limits on the agents

Unknown Speaker  4:26:47
we have aI

Matthias Miller  4:26:50
chat interface, initial message chat interface,

Unknown Speaker  4:27:13
uh, save,

Matthias Miller  4:27:21
security, public 60 seconds. Why do they have to make everything so hard? See, they just found things they could lock down to make it

Unknown Speaker  4:27:33
time limit. Oh, that's not what I wanted.

Matthias Miller  4:27:39
Custom domains. No, I don't need custom domains. I don't need web hooks.

Speaker 1  4:27:51
They lose you. Um, no, I'm sorry. I'm totally distracted by one of my VA is telling me that something is wrong, and His English is so bad I can't quite understand him. You

Unknown Speaker  4:28:11
will have my attention back in just a moment.

Matthias Miller  4:28:13
No worries. All right, so then here we have i

Matthias Miller  4:28:28
If All right, activity, chat, log, sources,

Unknown Speaker  4:28:34
files. We

Matthias Miller  4:28:37
don't need a blank space

Speaker 1  4:28:38
file, and I'm sorry, what were you asking me when you asked if you'd lost me.

Speaker 3  4:28:44
I have no idea. Nope. Deploy, embed, a public. Okay. Settings, General,

Matthias Miller  4:28:59
AI, chat interface, security, custom domains, public, yep,

Unknown Speaker  4:29:08
deploy a bit, all right. Well,

Matthias Miller  4:29:13
we have our chat bot, our $5 chat bot, is the next step? It seems like, literally, the next step is to

Speaker 1  4:29:23
take the sales page and actually get it up live on the web somewhere.

Unknown Speaker  4:29:30
Yeah.

Matthias Miller  4:29:36
Is that best suited for work, for go high level with a funnel with payment links in there. Or do you have a better

Speaker 1  4:29:44
yeah? Is Yes? Is that your preferred so I have one complaint with go high level for landing pages, and that is that it is slow, and it is statistically proven that page speed is a big deal. What's What's the fastest server you've got access?

Matthias Miller  4:30:00
To turn house WordPress running on

Speaker 1  4:30:04
WpX page, and then we can, I'm totally fine with the form being on go high level or stripe, or anything you want. Sure we could put the page itself on whatever loads fastest.

Matthias Miller  4:30:14
Totally this is, this is by far the fastest. Okay, so we will Utah with thanks for showing up for me.

Unknown Speaker  4:30:26
Generic

Matthias Miller  4:30:30
funnel, one pager,

Unknown Speaker  4:30:38
okay,

Matthias Miller  4:30:53
it's not work for everyone. Let's be clear. Okay, this is me. Can you write a Google App Script for a Google Doc that changes h1 to h2 h2 to h3 etc? Do?

Matthias Miller  4:31:23
See, there is no limit for my late I mean, there's no limit to my laziness. I

Unknown Speaker  4:31:53
That's awesome.

Unknown Speaker  4:31:56
What was what was awesome?

Matthias Miller  4:31:59
So I said, chat GPT, can you write a Google script that changes h1, to h2 h2, to h3 paste it in here. Ran it, it, did it, and now I get to paste it in here, somehow.

Unknown Speaker  4:32:12
Oh, cool.

Matthias Miller  4:32:15
Switch to code editor and delete and switch back to I was just saying. This is me being notoriously lazy. H2 Yeah, I mean, even this could really be h3 we could almost take it down another level.

Unknown Speaker  4:32:35
Let's try it. I

Unknown Speaker  4:32:44
so there should be h3

Matthias Miller  4:32:52
There we go.

Matthias Miller  4:33:01
All right, then the next question I would have is funnel bandits.

Matthias Miller  4:33:16
He has a results image. He's got I

Speaker 1  4:33:29
um, I love those particular images. Those are like Russell Brunson style, um, I'm gonna ask chatgpt How to get that and see this is gonna be fun. Oh, you know what circle?

Matthias Miller  4:33:58
Where is that? Is there a comic style that's XKCD. I love that one.

Unknown Speaker  4:34:07
Do you read XKCD?

Speaker 1  4:34:10
I have not heard of that in 20 years. I seen all that from my Linux System Administration days ago. Is it a comic strip? Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  4:34:25
It's like geeky comics.

Unknown Speaker  4:34:28
I love it, like it's just

Unknown Speaker  4:34:39
that is great. Anyway,

Matthias Miller  4:34:46
it is totally, it is totally such a geeky thing. I had a 20 year old in my office for a few weeks, and I got to introduce him to.

Unknown Speaker  4:35:28
I am asking chat GPT. I'm

Speaker 1  4:35:48
chat. GPT says This is commonly known as a sketch note or hand drawn infographic, and it has recommended a bunch of tools. For this, I'll open the link. Never seen that before. Miro, that's weird. I'm

Unknown Speaker  4:36:30
x calendar, draw all of Your fascinating

Unknown Speaker  4:36:36
notes. What is this? I

Speaker 1  4:37:07
paste me. That's, can you paste me exactly what you have on your screen in? Signal, yeah, and signal, yeah. Signal, I

Speaker 1  4:37:59
you're still at Oh, you're in chat. GPT, does cloud do graphics?

Matthias Miller  4:38:03
I don't know. I haven't used

Unknown Speaker  4:38:22
it all. That's not funny enough.

Speaker 1  4:38:32
I think, yeah, okay, I think the thing to do would be to tell it to turn the i

Unknown Speaker  4:39:07
i turn it

Matthias Miller  4:39:12
into a that's, it has to be funny. It's, it's,

Speaker 1  4:39:15
yeah, so I was gonna suggest, like, feet of the paragraph and have it do the funny part in words first and then make the illustration. Wait for this one. This is like, this is Dilbert. This is for that's

Speaker 1  4:39:38
not bad. It doesn't get the, yeah, it might be a distraction in the midst of the sales page. Might

Matthias Miller  4:39:57
be, it would be, it would actually be a funny hook. On the video. Yep, break into four images,

Matthias Miller  4:40:13
like just second each, or something that would Totally that would totally stand out in The feed I'm

Speaker 1  4:41:50
so, okay, Hey, not bad. It is bad, and it's not, yes, I'm we're on to something here. Look at this. So I gave the samples copy and paste back to you, look at your signal I got. I fed it the samples, and it actually is spot on with like the font and the look and feel. But I think I'm right. It's it's trying to cram way too many words in there. So first we need to decide what we want the graphic to say and then have it it's like too big of a leap to have it digest all the info and also do the graphic at the same time. Okay, so this is

Matthias Miller  4:42:39
the title. What do we? What do we? Power? Power, move, migration, yeah, flow chart, featuring, look before you leap. I

Matthias Miller  4:43:07
that I think is Actually, yeah, you're right, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  4:43:45
This is great.

Speaker 1  4:43:52
Can you imagine the absurdity of a couple of Anabaptists sitting around using AI to crack Dilbert

Matthias Miller  4:43:57
jokes for business? Did you know that in my high school publication, I did a hand drawn Dilbert parity?

Unknown Speaker  4:44:06
No, I did not

Matthias Miller  4:44:08
great. I mean, you wouldn't have had any reason to. But yes, okay, I

Unknown Speaker  4:44:26
Okay, so this needs to

Unknown Speaker  4:44:40
be, what are these? It's creating two. I'm.

Matthias Miller  4:45:30
Generous is a little extreme with

Unknown Speaker  4:45:33
comfortable.

Matthias Miller  4:45:39
Okay, So that's that one one pager elements. He is playing a little bit on the old versus new approach. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  4:45:56
we also don't have a ton of we could show A

Unknown Speaker  4:46:13
possible

Matthias Miller  4:46:17
we could show a redacted version of CSCs. I still don't think it's that impressive, but of their, of their invoice,

Speaker 1  4:46:30
not a bad idea. I'm going to see, we're going to look at Caleb's sales page sample and rattle some things off with regards to the use of graphics on the page. Okay, um, first graphic is a screenshot of his Stripe account, like Cha Ching, cha ching Cha Ching, showing that he sold a lot of $5 and some $1,000 sales. Now, even though we're looking at a sample, clever fellow, the sample is the sales page. He's trying to get us to buy his product, even while looking at the example, right? So he is literally trying to point out that you'll get money if you do what I do, which the whole point was for us to do what he does and pay him to do it right so, or at least buy his $5 thing. So that is like, what do we call that? Proof that is financial. Proof is screenshot number one, yep, and it is pretty close to the top. It's interesting. So if you think about it, he is starting his sales letter with proof quite Top Of course, he knows what kind of person He's appealing to. Internet marketers. Every internet marketer's dream is for their stripe to go to Ching every five minutes. So makes sense. Um, then there's a lot of text followed by some value bullet points that are reinforcing a, you know, I can help you achieve X without y bullet points. So just qualifiers addressing the problem.

Speaker 1  4:48:28
He is using kitchen remodeling as an example. Think about how home renovation companies operate. He says,

Matthias Miller  4:48:38
so this is where we should pull in a gym.

Speaker 1  4:48:42
Yes, very good. They don't just hand you a brochure that would expect you to hire them, that would be dumb. Instead, they send you a designer who does all this fancy stuff, and they give you a rendering of exactly what that kitchen is going to look like in your home. So painting the heaven Island, as Travis sago would probably say, they do not give you a generic image of a random kitchen. They show you what your kitchen will look like when they're done. Why do they take this time to do the 3d rendering? Because they know that the company that builds the plan is almost always the company that gets the contract. When you see your future kitchen visualized in your actual space, you are already mentally cooking meals there, and the very next thing is the first graphic, the kitchen renovation metaphor, graphic I am, my brain is trying to convert all that over from Caleb speak to what we need. And I'm just trying to picture that so the gym

Speaker 1  4:49:59
I would love. You to take that graphic that's on your screen right now, yep, and literally remove the custom discount and change all those prices back to what they would be in full. Probably

Speaker 1  4:50:22
nobody's got time for that, but I think it would be,

Matthias Miller  4:50:28
it's not that hard reinforce

Speaker 1  4:50:29
the pain. Okay? I know that the point of this graphic is literally to appeal, because nobody reads a wallet text. It's to break up the wallet text and to get some interest. The graphic, in this case, is simply reinforcing the point that was made. Now, where is our this is immediately under, under the section called Okay, Caleb, but what exactly is the springboard strategy? Do we have a section of our sales letter that's called Okay? Matthias, so what exactly is the power move

Unknown Speaker  4:51:22
that

Speaker 1  4:51:28
I see flaws emerging, which is fine, totally fine. Scroll down, slowly, please. Where does the gym part come in?

Unknown Speaker  4:51:41
It's up above, little higher,

Matthias Miller  4:51:44
yeah, hang on

Unknown Speaker  4:51:47
the OCD.

Unknown Speaker  4:51:53
Oh, wait, wait, what

Matthias Miller  4:51:55
exactly is,

Speaker 1  4:51:56
yep, what did that say before you're undo? I do, oh, you got, where is that um? Is the so vibration method, yep, the no question mark. Okay, so, so hang on, just go back up a little bit to the gym part. It's like so, so literally, we just need a graphic

Speaker 1  4:52:37
that is representing in the same style. Um, yeah, someone at the gym being charged extra to to lift, you know, per per weight, or however you would say that, let

Speaker 1  4:52:59
me try that some GPT. And can you just gonna start a chat? GBT window.

Matthias Miller  4:53:07
Here's this guy, power booth migration.

Unknown Speaker  4:53:11
How's that? You like it?

Speaker 1  4:53:13
I do like it, but I think we need it a little further down the page. Give me a second. Well, take this concept and turn it into a humorous, humorous, I could spell joke that would go well in a comic style graphic and the the line, or the concept, is, I

Speaker 1  4:54:07
now that's chat bot. Or what's the one page? One page, one page. There it is. I

Unknown Speaker  4:55:26
Hey, to lift. That's great. I

Unknown Speaker  4:55:30
Don't know if this is i

Matthias Miller  4:55:40
Yeah, It doesn't know how to do That. I

Unknown Speaker  4:56:18
do you know what i

Unknown Speaker  4:56:23
font,

Matthias Miller  4:56:29
Lex and DECA. I don't know if I

Unknown Speaker  4:56:32
can Get that in Canva or Not. I

Speaker 1  4:57:45
HBT appears to be doing what I asked it to do, and I like it is just being a fantastically slow to paint the image.

Unknown Speaker  4:57:54
See this one came back. Here's this one.

Speaker 1  4:57:59
I love it that is good. Save that please.

Speaker 1  4:58:15
I make these slash commands in WordPress. Cool. I

Speaker 1  4:58:24
I got another one. Where's the download button? This is good, and I want it downloaded. And I'm going to change the layout. I'm dropping this back to you in signal you

Matthias Miller  4:59:09
this would make a really good it's funny, but it's almost too hard to understand. But this would make a good format for an old versus new. The old way, get started for free. Start with a plan, or start with the basic start with one plan, or start with sales hub, ad marketing hub, ad operations hub. Add 5000 contacts, add 5000 text messages. Hmm? And then the new way, and only use a few features. And then the new way, pay two set 97 a month, get access to all features. Actually use it. Mm. What

Unknown Speaker  5:00:11
do you think,

Speaker 1  5:00:17
meaning that this screenshot here is showing how you're being nickel and dime.

Matthias Miller  5:00:24
Okay, I'm not sure what what I'm doing with the screenshot. I'm just doing what I'm told here

Speaker 1  5:00:29
for you, I'm suggesting that we use this in the same spot that Caleb is using his stripe screenshot, right? But in his case, he's trying to show, look how much money you can make. And in our case we're going to start with, look how many you can save. And actually that starts with, look how much money you're losing. Yep,

Speaker 3  5:01:09
okay, so we have this, this, this, this, this, this,

Matthias Miller  5:01:16
move layer, move To top, bring to front. Okay, so then,

Unknown Speaker  5:01:38
presto, I

Matthias Miller  5:01:56
so let's use that online for the right alignment. There we go. I'm

Matthias Miller  5:02:14
unfortunately, I can't match HubSpot fonts and make it bold.

Unknown Speaker  5:02:22
I That's fine.

Matthias Miller  5:02:24
Oh, the custom discount is probably go to, yeah, if you can just

Unknown Speaker  5:02:27
white it out or something, Yep, there you go.

Unknown Speaker  5:02:36
I can't drag it. There we go. Ah,

Unknown Speaker  5:02:59
12 month commitment, yeah, we can

Matthias Miller  5:03:03
trying to highlight that.

Speaker 1  5:03:05
No, I was just gonna say, like, we can tell we actually should probably clip that out. But no, no, not clip it out. We actually should almost highlight that as not in the graphic, but in terms of,

Matthias Miller  5:03:17
like, if we do the old way, 12 month commitment, yeah, I mean, the The fun thing about it is that, when you upgrade, if you, if you have to upgrade your SMS in the middle of your contract, you pay it for the rest of The contract.

Unknown Speaker  5:03:33
Yeah, wow. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  5:04:06
Review your order should come off. I'm

Unknown Speaker  5:04:26
Is there a title we should put on here

Speaker 1  5:04:31
and look at Caleb's thing? But I don't think so. Now there is no title on his there's in in text, not on the graphic, but HTML text in parentheses, it says results of one day from one day of running ads. We can do the same and say like, you know, typical HubSpot users

Unknown Speaker  5:04:57
or actual.

Matthias Miller  5:05:01
It, yeah, extra actual HubSpot Bill

Speaker 1  5:05:10
and his is horizontal, which what we're looking at here is very not horizontal, but you know, spawn could turn it at a crazy angle.

Matthias Miller  5:05:25
I have an idea. I

Matthias Miller  5:06:05
I thought maybe I could very easily.

Unknown Speaker  5:06:12
That's interesting.

Matthias Miller  5:06:18
I'm gonna guess there's none of These we actually Want to Use. I'm

Unknown Speaker  5:07:40
yep, I Like that action,

Unknown Speaker  5:07:43
actual HubSpot invoice.

Matthias Miller  5:07:50
Okay, but then that makes it when you have a caption on it, I don't know that we want the caption. That's not where I thought the caption would go.

Speaker 1  5:08:02
So the way Caleb did it is he wrote it in text on the page right above the image and centered like see where it says. Let me show you exactly how to do it. Just add a line of text below that.

Unknown Speaker  5:08:21
It seems to me like you

Unknown Speaker  5:08:32
should be able to maybe not.

Unknown Speaker  5:08:44
It's a row, add a row.

Matthias Miller  5:08:53
It's another row, add a Table. I'm

Unknown Speaker  5:09:25
okay, well, I'm

Unknown Speaker  5:09:56
there we go. I'm.

Matthias Miller  5:10:08
That is actually pretty good. Now we're getting somewhere,

Speaker 1  5:10:11
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I like that. Yep. Are we gonna leave the whole page white,

Unknown Speaker  5:10:17
white background. I mean, I don't know. What do you want.

Speaker 1  5:10:22
Yeah, that's fine. Is it boring? It's morning, yeah. And now, okay, thanks for pointing that out. So when Caleb's case that graphic, and I know this is on purpose, it is, it is visible above the fold, like the top edge is C or it's on the one two, so there's only four lines of text, and then the parentheses, and then a tiny peak at the Yep. There you go,

Unknown Speaker  5:10:55
yep.

Matthias Miller  5:10:57
And I was trying to move this guy, not the other guy.

Matthias Miller  5:11:12
And then this reinforces that I love it. That's

Speaker 1  5:11:14
the whole point. You can probably move those next two or even three lines above the image, yes,

Speaker 1  5:11:28
yeah, I like it. No, no, I like that. Then, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, very good. I like it. Okay, so then down to the section called,

Unknown Speaker  5:11:44
where does it go?

Speaker 1  5:11:46
What exactly is the X strategy. Get paid a lift. Check out real quick. I like that a lot, but check out real quick. The graphics I put in signal

Matthias Miller  5:11:58
the last one, the last one's really it's really good. The only thing I would change is like,

Matthias Miller  5:12:11
the hook could almost be like, free. CRM,

Speaker 1  5:12:19
I don't know that chat GBT will cooperate, but let's try

Matthias Miller  5:12:24
your prompt doesn't dictate that.

Speaker 1  5:12:28
So like I would, I'm just talking to chat GPT, and so I can tell it's something new. So like, redo that, do exactly that again, but in the frame, hanging from the fishing pole on the left, change the text to read,

Matthias Miller  5:13:00
and then also,

Unknown Speaker  5:13:03
are you CRM?

Speaker 1  5:13:11
Hang on. I've never, yeah, I'm hanging I've never seen

Matthias Miller  5:13:21
you can't ask it for the prompt that it used to generate

Speaker 1  5:13:24
the last one. How you do that? I've never seen that.

Matthias Miller  5:13:27
Just ask it. Say, can you give me the prompt that you use to generate that last image? Can you give me the text for the prompt or something? I

Unknown Speaker  5:13:45
what it'd be called an internal prompt. I

Matthias Miller  5:13:51
mean, you just, I mean, you could, you can,

Speaker 1  5:13:54
I'm trying it your way. Can give me the text of the prompt that you used to generate that last I

Speaker 1  5:14:14
oops, oops, oops, oh, oh, Wait and canvas, ah, come back. I'm going to say,

Unknown Speaker  5:14:28
Can I touch it?

Speaker 1  5:14:37
Can I highlight it No. Describe what you want to add or replace. I want to replace the words all, all in one at. Everything you need with the words free CRM.

Speaker 1  5:15:18
And then I want to replace the words I'm

Matthias Miller  5:15:40
if you had to choose between all in one and everything You need, wouldn't you keep everything you Need? Yes, you

Matthias Miller  5:16:44
I think less words is more. I mean, that's what I'm after.

Speaker 1  5:17:00
I'm gonna take all in one out of that as well, just see what in the world happens here.

Unknown Speaker  5:17:18
It really did give me the prompt, by the way. I had no idea you could do that.

Matthias Miller  5:17:37
Oh, there is a vo three. I was

Speaker 2  5:17:39
reading on that I forgot.

Speaker 1  5:18:00
Oh, like, Are those yours? Like, is everything on the screen, something you had it make? Yep, the newscaster looked professional, like a lady in a blue newsroom office.

Matthias Miller  5:18:18
Okay, the clink, link, the clinking sound you

Speaker 1  5:18:20
probably can't hear. Can't hear and not

Matthias Miller  5:18:24
probably can't hear it, but that's kind of a fun automation.

Unknown Speaker  5:18:27
Yeah, I cannot hear it. I see it here. The audio

Matthias Miller  5:18:33
is, I mean, the audio is terrible, but this would make a great intro clip for a podcast. Anyway, let's not get distracted. Focus, focus, focus. Okay, so

Matthias Miller  5:19:02
you Yeah, I was using, I was playing around. I don't even know what the, what it was

Unknown Speaker  5:19:08
doing with the with the,

Speaker 1  5:19:11
yeah, that that looks, that looks very realistic, especially the top row,

Matthias Miller  5:19:18
10s of 1000s of business. It was trying to put captions on it, and it completely botched it,

Unknown Speaker  5:19:26
getting costly. Up, up,

Unknown Speaker  5:19:30
exactly,

Unknown Speaker  5:19:33
great. What do you think

Matthias Miller  5:19:34
about this version?

Speaker 1  5:19:38
You beat me to it, yes. How did you get exactly what I had? Did you upload mine?

Matthias Miller  5:19:42
I uploaded yours. I create the problem. I take the prompt, I read it, run. I'm literally doing

Unknown Speaker  5:19:47
it. You're still faster than me. That's so funny.

Matthias Miller  5:19:50
Where does this thing go on the page?

Speaker 1  5:19:53
I think right there where you have your pay to lift, you could almost put those side by side. Okay, well, I like literally when get get the edited version of mine, but it whatever. Go ahead,

Unknown Speaker  5:20:08
let's try this.

Speaker 1  5:20:16
I've got I've got my version now. Your chat CBT is faster than mine. I've got mine now, and I like mine just the hair better, because it says free CRM in the box.

Unknown Speaker  5:20:26
Send it coming.

Matthias Miller  5:20:31
I You obviously typed in your prompt. I didn't in

Speaker 1  5:20:37
mine. Here it is, all right, that's amazing how, like it really did just edit the image, or if it did regenerate, it got everything else about it exactly the Same. Somehow. It's pretty insane.

Unknown Speaker  5:20:55
Downloads.

Matthias Miller  5:20:58
Okay, where's my I

Matthias Miller  5:21:40
I'm not quite sure if I like this with every bell and whistle, but I don't want to get caught

Unknown Speaker  5:22:01
over thinking. Stuff. And

Speaker 1  5:22:05
then we have the mic. Let's change it with every bell and whistle with every function you need, with every i

Speaker 1  5:22:24
Very good, no extra cost. That's exactly right. But let's not say add on with every part you need. I need a better word with every

Matthias Miller  5:22:33
feature, tool, like tool, yep. Okay, so then here, where does the power move migration go? Does that image go here? Oh, it's down here. Where do you want

Unknown Speaker  5:22:47
it? Let me compare to famous Caleb. Looking for famous Caleb. I

Speaker 1  5:23:04
uh oh, some Okay, remind me so he's got, so after that, yeah, right there. The next there's, like a lot. Here's how the springboard strategy works. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, 123, um, XYZ is dead in 2025, do we have a section that matches that? And then header to the three step Springboard strategy, how we make it work on a low budget? And then this is like the implementation section, step one, step two, step three, step four. And that is the top of that after the headline in the first line is where Springboard strategy,

Matthias Miller  5:23:47
before the steps that

Speaker 1  5:23:49
go down one more section. What do we got? Is ours significantly shorter than,

Matthias Miller  5:23:53
yeah, real results in your next move.

Speaker 1  5:23:57
Okay, looks like Fine. Leave that there, and let's just add the next graphic right there. So here's how we do and after that line, right where your cursor is, hit, enter and add the image. Yep,

Matthias Miller  5:24:07
which, which image is that? This is the

Speaker 1  5:24:13
you have it, it's, it's, it's a copy that. Oh, it's that one. Yeah, it is that one. Sorry. So like that one up,

Matthias Miller  5:24:21
if I can, if it lets

Unknown Speaker  5:24:24
me or her, okay?

Speaker 1  5:24:29
And then what goes down here? Okay? And what he's got down there, he has a section. It's actually his section two, right, step two, talking about one pager elements, and it's just like four boxes showing Hold on one second. Hello, hello, hey, thanks a lot. Yes, got the post reset I'm running to get some batteries program that sounds good. How long do you think. Can be all right, you for you together. Great. The post is reset, okay, awesome. Thank you.

Speaker 1  5:25:21
Point is, is that right here, like it's the equivalent of your step two, setting the stage. He's got a graphic that says one pager elements, and it's four boxes. Who is this for why it works step by step? CTA, he's describing the layout of the page.

Matthias Miller  5:25:41
So it could just be. I mean, if we just had a What, if we did Something like this? I

Unknown Speaker  5:26:43
That's a great idea. Um,

Unknown Speaker  5:27:02
hmm.

Speaker 1  5:27:14
While that is loading, can you go to Kayla's page on your screen? Second tab there from the left. Scroll up. Oh yeah, that's fine. Either one see those long, horizontal yellow boxes where he's got a CTA? Yep, he's got those, like, several times through the page as well. Okay, so we need something like that. I'm

Unknown Speaker  5:28:18
I'll be selling hamburgers before you know it?

Matthias Miller  5:28:33
Well, we don't know where it needs to go to yet. Are we going to create we'll create a second page. Is that right?

Speaker 1  5:28:39
Yeah, I'm thinking that's just a checkout page in GHL, which

Speaker 3  5:28:46
you don't care if it's slow, correct, okay,

Matthias Miller  5:28:51
So what if I just did this? Going to I

Unknown Speaker  5:29:04
our new migration

Unknown Speaker  5:29:06
readiness assessment, and

Matthias Miller  5:29:10
then we'll just add a redirect to it.

Unknown Speaker  5:29:21
Is that the wrong?

Matthias Miller  5:29:22
Is that too harsh?

Speaker 1  5:29:30
Dark blue? Yeah, blues. I like that first blue, pretty well. You like that? Sure.

Matthias Miller  5:29:42
Okay, so then we do duplicate and,

Speaker 3  5:29:53
oh, wow, you really don't want me to move. Do you what just happened? I lost it.

Unknown Speaker  5:30:03
You lost what? Oh, you said, duplicate and disappear. Okay, again. Click off of it for a second, then back on.

Speaker 1  5:30:21
It doesn't like the it. It thinks you're dragging it into the bulleted list, and it doesn't want to

Unknown Speaker  5:30:36
go has to do with the blocks,

Matthias Miller  5:30:40
okay? Well, there's a way around this.

Unknown Speaker  5:30:46
Where do we want to

Speaker 1  5:30:51
his first one shows up a little below the first graphic, not the not this financial one, but the first illustration, yeah, a little below there, like right here, Yep, okay,

Matthias Miller  5:31:18
and then presumably another One here.

Unknown Speaker  5:31:21
Yeah, All right, I'm

Unknown Speaker  5:32:06
Hey, we prevail.

Matthias Miller  5:32:13
Okay, is this good to go? Then

Unknown Speaker  5:32:18
we had another image generating somewhere.

Matthias Miller  5:32:20
Yeah, we did. You're right. Do you like this one?

Unknown Speaker  5:32:28
Good enough for today?

Matthias Miller  5:32:33
This one would be like, right here,

Unknown Speaker  5:32:37
correct? I

Speaker 1  5:32:57
move. Nobody else does the conversion, conversation, migration, like we do below the image. Love it.

Speaker 1  5:33:12
Go, maybe a pinch of extra space there, I don't know, whatever. It's fine. And then we could

Matthias Miller  5:33:19
almost, I think something that would help would be

Unknown Speaker  5:33:23
centering these.

Unknown Speaker  5:33:29
Yeah, actually, okay, yeah, I can see that.

Speaker 1  5:33:38
So then Caleb has between that nobody else line and the step three line. He has another line that says, want more guidance. Question mark, hint. You're reading my one page right now. And then he has a CTA, again, immediately below that and still above step three. Want more guidance. I

Speaker 1  5:34:03
and yeah, and obviously you're getting Yeah. There you go, getting inside. You

Unknown Speaker  5:34:23
Yes, again, I didn't

Unknown Speaker  5:34:25
really Orna in it.

Unknown Speaker  5:34:32
See everything attacked. I

Matthias Miller  5:34:46
about making it difficult.

Unknown Speaker  5:34:59
Okay. Should probably

Matthias Miller  5:35:06
let's publish and then let's change the I

Matthias Miller  5:35:34
Do you want to take the menu off?

Unknown Speaker  5:35:41
Yes, see, I think there's a template.

Matthias Miller  5:35:53
No, not a template. I want To swap templates. I

Matthias Miller  5:36:04
Okay, fine. I'm

Matthias Miller  5:36:25
page without title. We have a blank

Unknown Speaker  5:36:29
footer only. I'm

Speaker 1  5:36:48
Wow, new space. Okay, there you go. He does have a logo and his bio photo at the top of his which I gotta admit, makes it look lively.

Matthias Miller  5:37:13
Are they side by side?

Speaker 1  5:37:16
The bio photo, the logo is by itself at the top, and a little band, like a header band, and the tiny little profile photo is next to his name, so where it says, by Matthias Miller, yes,

Matthias Miller  5:37:37
There's a way for this. There's a word

Unknown Speaker  5:37:39
text

Matthias Miller  5:37:46
I don't know which guy to use.

Unknown Speaker  5:37:50
I do that. I was kidding me. Way down. There you go, which makes

Matthias Miller  5:38:00
it look like a blog post. Yep,

Unknown Speaker  5:38:03
I think that's the goal code. Haas feels huge to me there and we shrink it,

Unknown Speaker  5:38:12
yeah, and I also want to,

Matthias Miller  5:38:22
I also want to figure out a way to, well, maybe there's enough margin at the top. Now, okay, but that's not showing up support. Why not?

Unknown Speaker  5:38:37
It's above, it's above the first headline.

Matthias Miller  5:38:45
Oh, is it yanking?

Matthias Miller  5:39:00
Okay, that looks tacky, but

Unknown Speaker  5:39:05
something to do with the template. Yeah, I

Unknown Speaker  5:39:31
Oh, I didn't scroll What the

Matthias Miller  5:39:35
I don't know what's going on anymore. Okay, so

Unknown Speaker  5:39:39
here we can do something

Unknown Speaker  5:39:50
like that, yeah,

Speaker 1  5:39:53
okay, um, I'm gonna scroll back down. Yep, that's hilarious. Is okay. And then so we got too many of those blue boxes down, down. Slow down. Scroll a little more slowly, please. Yeah, the second blue box can go, maybe not go. It needs to move, probably, but hang on, let me find the right spot again. Kitchen renovations three more strategy. One pager is your post it notes, and we have one right below that. Then he has step three, okay, so then he has step three, and he's talking about time, and you have a section there talking about time. The result is mind blowing. And let's see. I'm just trying to figure out she has a step four. Oh, his step three is very wordy, and he has a very wordy step four that you don't have. Okay? And in the middle of all that, where is your next move?

Matthias Miller  5:41:02
What if we would put it in here?

Speaker 1  5:41:07
Yeah, we're gonna put a graphic right there, not the box, but a graphic. Okay, so the box another set, yeah, I think so when you delete it, oh, the anyhow, you do have one more below, right like, way down, yeah, yeah, okay, perfect. Um.

Speaker 1  5:41:33
So then somewhere right in there, he has a graphic he is literate. Of course, he's selling a funnel, and he's talking about landing pages and how well this works. And now he has a graphic there that says lead magnets versus custom plans. The left side of the graphic says 2023 approach. And it's like PDF, you know, blah, blah. And on the right side it says 2025 approach. Custom, personalized plan, high conversion rate. It's like good and bad, bad on the left, Good on the right. Yep, old way, New Way. I

Unknown Speaker  5:44:41
Nice

Speaker 3  5:44:52
AI included. It's not included. I. A good way to put it optional. You

Speaker 1  5:45:17
want to say graphic your he says, Can you help me with but it Doesn't say that you want it to Make The I

Matthias Miller  5:47:49
when we were generating our podcast logo, somebody was worried about generating the logo because they were afraid it was promoting alcohol, and therefore would be promoting, effectively adult content that's

Speaker 1  5:48:05
referring to that one with the clinking glasses you showed me a bit ago. Yep. Okay,

Matthias Miller  5:48:14
it's easier these days just to mark your podcast is explicit, rather than worry About getting banned by somebody, some weird bot,

Unknown Speaker  5:48:24
yeah, I

Unknown Speaker  5:49:00
I don't love it.

Speaker 1  5:49:07
Yeah, I would, I would paste it. I would maybe paste the example again and say, No, make it a little more like this, including the yellow header. Or actually, wait, wait, let's give it the right one. Hold on. I'm gonna paste you what it's actually supposed to be like,

Speaker 1  5:49:38
coming there it is in your signal. Maybe just upload that to chat. GPT, I'm.

Unknown Speaker  5:50:25
Pay for everything. Is nothing

Matthias Miller  5:50:28
that's a hair strong. It's a hair strong. Search for free, pay for contacts, pay for SMS, pay for everything,

Unknown Speaker  5:50:39
or per you can say, Pay Per Everything,

Matthias Miller  5:50:47
then would you do? Paper, contact, paper, SMS, I.

Speaker 1  5:51:12
It looks odd to say per that many times. Yep, pay for, okay, yeah, if you're gonna say that, change it all back to four. Yeah, I like that. Pay for things you don't use. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  5:51:31
sign annual contract. Yeah, I

Speaker 1  5:52:12
optional, optional ticket. I'm not sure what the word ticket means there, yeah, I train. Oh. What

Matthias Miller  5:52:37
about this? Pay for everything, like 297, from

Unknown Speaker  5:52:41
like that, yeah,

Speaker 1  5:52:48
pay for every No, I want to say everything included with AI part kind of undermines that, but I

Speaker 1  5:53:05
pay for, because up above, every time you use the word, The phrase pay for, it's a negative. Yeah, unlimited. I

Unknown Speaker  5:53:26
There you go.

Matthias Miller  5:53:32
I mean, that makes me kind of want to bite, if I'm honest, do we want to throw this in? Yeah, it's not completely transparent with the AI thing, but

Matthias Miller  5:53:58
I'm also not sure at what point you want to just stop it. We're thinking it.

Speaker 1  5:54:08
Do you want to specify? Yeah? Keep going. You might want to fix your Yeah, uh, way down at the bottom. Let's see if we can get it to put the only 297 in that yellow box and the last lower right yellow box.

Unknown Speaker  5:54:30
Let's do it

Unknown Speaker  5:54:34
on you're not joking about the overthinking everything easily, very easy to do, not 8020

Matthias Miller  5:54:44
not 8020 at all, all.

Matthias Miller  5:54:52
Right. Well, we're getting close to the landing page, which means we need to put together the funnel, which means that we then we need to put the ads together.

Matthias Miller  5:55:12
Water I keep not filling up my water bottle. It's not good. I

Matthias Miller  5:55:24
It's so dumb, but the details like this end up being feeling overwhelming to me. If I'm doing it solo,

Unknown Speaker  5:55:31
and it's

Matthias Miller  5:55:33
actually not dumb, but anyway,

Speaker 1  5:55:36
not dumb at all. It is actually great, like I'm doing almost nothing. You're doing all the work, and somehow I'm helping you.

Matthias Miller  5:55:45
So Kevin and I on our podcast, we're talking this morning like their core theme is union, which is so he's he's gone down deep down almost every rabbit hole you can imagine, in terms of therapy, training and stuff, and then just stopping short of actually becoming certified, because get your hands tied at that point. But he says everywhere, the core wound of of humanity, the core lie, and the core wound of humanity is separation. Moving from we to i.

Unknown Speaker  5:56:28
Okay,

Matthias Miller  5:56:29
so the tradition of how I have historically solved these types of problems is, well, I should be the kind of person who can do these. And why do I need somebody else? I need a better myself so that, and I think I have, for a long time, and in the process surrender of saying, Okay, I need people. It's fine if I bring people along who feel like they don't do anything, and I need that to get things done. But that's kind of the migration from, in my opinion, the i doing it all me and trying to fix me, and some, some various capacity we experience life in which we are rejected from getting the help we need, and then we look inward and dig deeper and do it ourselves and get get frustrated. It doesn't work. It's very clearly, I don't know, I mean, it's very clear that really, there's genuinely next to nothing that gets accomplished solo, ever anywhere.

Unknown Speaker  5:57:41
Yeah, absolutely serve for free.

Matthias Miller  5:57:42
Paper contest, pay for that. Pay for things you don't use. Signing no contracts. Miss the AI train, new way, unlimited contacts, unlimited SMS, unlimited, everything, 297, per month. What

Speaker 1  5:57:52
do you think the balance is awkward, but it did almost right. Let's literally use it right now and we can somehow improve that later.

Unknown Speaker  5:58:08
I just have

Matthias Miller  5:58:11
about this much care in me right now about that. All right, this guy down here.

Speaker 3  5:58:37
There you go. I like it. What do you think

Speaker 1  5:58:42
I am pretty happy. Let me go over the ending. I'm looking at Kayla's page again.

Matthias Miller  5:58:47
He does have a text me,

Speaker 1  5:58:49
yes, I think, well, yeah, I think you should as well. Have you seen can you go? Can you scroll up a little bit? Yeah. Okay. So then there's one last thing. He's got a little stack of review, testimonial, social proof. Ah, oh, this is hilarious. I literally did not see this earlier, but Caleb himself has what I was describing. Option one, take the process I laid out and go do the work yourself. Or option two, have us do it. That is so funny, and I didn't that's not subliminal either. I never scrolled that far down the page, but that's hilarious that Caleb did exactly what I was dreaming of. Um, just a hair above that. He has social proof, so the whole thing is like starting right where you are. He's talking about the cost and the time. He goes over the last step of the process. Then he says, here's why this works so well. Then with some you know, stuff. With it, then this isn't working. This isn't just working for us. And he's got screenshots, social proof, and then he's got the closer, yeah, close anyway, literally, you got two options, either go do this yourself, or you can have us do it for you. Blah, blah, blah, send Caleb a message and whatever. So he's got social proof there.

Matthias Miller  6:00:23
I don't know what social proof to put in. You don't have any right not, I mean, not really.

Speaker 1  6:00:32
His social proof is like, it's clearly screenshots from a school group. The strategy is killing it for my coaching offer, turn my ads on Tuesday, and I've already had 10 people buy. Hey guys, I got 14 sales. I've already got 7k in revenue. This is solid. So on and so forth. Um,

Matthias Miller  6:01:13
that's discovery focus, not CRM. I mean, I don't even know

Speaker 1  6:01:19
you have any generic like Matthias is the best person in the world To work with kind of stuff.

Speaker 3  6:01:24
Screenshots, yeah, um,

Matthias Miller  6:01:42
it's let's see, not about CRM stuff.

Speaker 1  6:01:49
The classic thing to do in this situation, when you're getting started and don't have relevant screenshots, is to use anything like literally anything, not about this product, not about this service, maybe not even about this company. Just like, you know, working with Matthias was such an awesome experience from some guy 20 years ago. I

Matthias Miller  6:02:16
can do my book reviews mamas,

Unknown Speaker  6:02:20
it doesn't mention the book, it'd be great,

Unknown Speaker  6:02:24
like I have no

Unknown Speaker  6:02:28
no social proof.

Unknown Speaker  6:02:31
It's terrible. I know it is. I

Matthias Miller  6:02:45
I mean, I just don't, I

Matthias Miller  6:03:03
so, I mean, that's not relevant.

Unknown Speaker  6:03:09
Gemini, I

Matthias Miller  6:03:42
I'm maybe I wanted to

Matthias Miller  6:04:26
Yeah, that's not Helping.

Unknown Speaker  6:04:35
That's fascinating, but

Unknown Speaker  6:04:42
not helpful. Here we go. I'm.

Matthias Miller  6:05:15
What if we just throw these? I should look it up in a incognito or something so it shows or there's a way to view it like somebody else is seeing it.

Unknown Speaker  6:05:36
Let me see if I

Matthias Miller  6:05:38
can. Oh, you have to be logged in to see it so that doesn't help.

Unknown Speaker  6:05:46
Oh, maybe You just i

Unknown Speaker  6:06:13
What about these?

Unknown Speaker  6:06:21
I bummer, not overshoot a little bit.

Unknown Speaker  6:06:38
I it's about the newsletter. I'm

Speaker 3  6:07:00
I can't hear it. It's about the newsletter, okay,

Unknown Speaker  6:07:14
you had some more folders. There anything else? Oh, lots of empties. I

Matthias Miller  6:07:23
this same one we found before.

Unknown Speaker  6:07:34
That's no I'm

Unknown Speaker  6:07:43
those are all

Matthias Miller  6:07:45
unrelated. I mean, Gabe,

Matthias Miller  6:07:53
but there's no testimonial photos.

Speaker 3  6:07:57
Oh, those are those testimonials. I But where was this? This was on,

Unknown Speaker  6:08:10
not that I

Unknown Speaker  6:08:25
that's not bad. Stay right there, please.

Unknown Speaker  6:08:34
Yeah, let's use that.

Matthias Miller  6:08:38
This is also really good one. I

Speaker 1  6:08:51
Yeah, yeah, let's use those four I guess you could call it the four verticals. And we're gonna have to massage it a little bit, but basically it's gonna be like, you know, why? Why work with us, or something like that, or, you know, you know, maybe you can turn it into, alright, alright. But do you really know what you're doing, you know, something like that, and then just say, like, I've been building software and systems for 30 years. I'm

Matthias Miller  6:09:43
Come on, but I don't have to okay for i.

Matthias Miller  6:10:03
So then,

Unknown Speaker  6:10:06
effectively, just my, I,

Speaker 1  6:10:27
Caleb section says this isn't working just for us, it's the headline. We have dozens of clients running the springboard strategy in numerous different verticals, selling all kinds of different offers. Maybe instead of, do you know what you're doing, maybe say, Okay, but why choose you?

Unknown Speaker  6:10:58
Guess that would be, Why Choose Us? I us right?

Unknown Speaker  6:11:09
And how do I add an image well or another column? I

Unknown Speaker  6:11:27
That's what I'm after. I'm

Matthias Miller  6:11:50
okay, we had somewhere. We had testimonial photos that We're going to download. I'm

Matthias Miller  6:12:28
I'm going to share the window. Let me know if any of these You think would be good to I'm

Unknown Speaker  6:13:06
Which one did I use For Dan?

Unknown Speaker  6:13:15
Edit this one And I flipped it. I

Matthias Miller  6:14:00
I would really rather avoid referencing the client name,

Unknown Speaker  6:14:03
because I agree.

Matthias Miller  6:14:13
Okay, do you don't like this one?

Speaker 1  6:14:17
Why not? I said didn't like it. I tried to find someone deep down. No, I don't, I don't think so maybe I said something wrong. I do like that. Well, no, it was, that's fine. I

Unknown Speaker  6:14:40
I wonder if there's another

Unknown Speaker  6:14:59
title that we could.

Unknown Speaker  6:15:26
I don't know what's

Matthias Miller  6:15:34
could also call him a Silicon Valley CMO. Okay. Do you have an opinion?

Speaker 1  6:15:46
I don't. I well, I do. I don't think that's not gonna I don't feel like those titles are gonna prove or disprove anything. Why not do like Dan D, so you don't have to give his whole name. You know Dallas, Texas brat roll Brad Roland, you know Springfield, Illinois,

Matthias Miller  6:16:20
hometown or working town.

Unknown Speaker  6:16:22
I really don't care. Whatever sounds more impressive.

Unknown Speaker  6:16:26
Rad, R,

Unknown Speaker  6:16:27
nevermind

Matthias Miller  6:16:31
that people can pull up the images and probably probably see it. Most

Unknown Speaker  6:16:34
people won't. Literally, most people won't.

Unknown Speaker  6:16:40
Okay,

Unknown Speaker  6:16:51
the one about meetings is not so helpful. What

Unknown Speaker  6:16:55
about this one?

Unknown Speaker  6:16:59
Yep, that's good.

Speaker 1  6:17:07
And I would totally use the first line of the next one, where he's talking about competent software setup and the numbers, because, Like, that's what the whole page is about, right? I

Unknown Speaker  6:17:43
we got to crop.

Unknown Speaker  6:17:55
How do I? I?

Matthias Miller  6:18:05
This guy looks nothing like this anymore, but okay, um, how in the world do I

Matthias Miller  6:18:20
I literally Can't,

Unknown Speaker  6:18:29
literally can't,

Matthias Miller  6:18:31
can't crap.

Unknown Speaker  6:18:39
Okay,

Unknown Speaker  6:18:41
let's do this.

Unknown Speaker  6:18:44
You can do it from here.

Unknown Speaker  6:18:57
Interesting, okay, I

Matthias Miller  6:19:16
Well, that's stupid. I'm

Unknown Speaker  6:19:43
like, literally,

Unknown Speaker  6:19:51
okay, then we're going to do, I'm.

Matthias Miller  6:20:22
To talk about making it difficult.

Unknown Speaker  6:20:38
Where's the crop at? Okay? So we you

Matthias Miller  6:21:14
have you ever do you know Scott?

Unknown Speaker  6:21:18
No, I I

Matthias Miller  6:21:29
used to be in plant period years ago. Don't know what happened to

Unknown Speaker  6:21:37
him. Ever cross paths with him that I can Think of? I

Matthias Miller  6:22:57
but no, it doesn't Save I'll talk about flaky. I'm

Matthias Miller  6:23:41
This is just, this is beyond frustrating.

Matthias Miller  6:23:50
Open image, a new tab, that's What we're going to do. I'm

Matthias Miller  6:24:40
I think it's guys. Mills, but yeah,

Matthias Miller  6:25:20
and there would be one more

Unknown Speaker  6:25:30
in this. One is this worth?

Speaker 1  6:25:36
I think four is quite good enough. Did you get the one about the numbers? Yes, I think that's and then what

Matthias Miller  6:25:44
about this one? I could throw this one, it'd be an even number. Do you like that one?

Unknown Speaker  6:25:50
It's already an even number. I feel like I'm missing something.

Matthias Miller  6:25:54
Oh, you want these four? That's what you're saying. Okay, I get it.

Unknown Speaker  6:25:57
Yep, okay,

Unknown Speaker  6:26:01
save and publish, And let's take a peek. I'm

Matthias Miller  6:26:28
could we kill this second? Could we cut it down to this?

Unknown Speaker  6:26:31
Yeah, please.

Unknown Speaker  6:26:41
Nice. You.

Unknown Speaker  6:27:11
This one is almost worth

Matthias Miller  6:27:20
renaming you just really would prefer not to get, really like to fly under the radar, basically,

Unknown Speaker  6:27:37
like, use an entirely different one. If that's not too good,

Unknown Speaker  6:27:40
no, it's,

Matthias Miller  6:27:43
I don't mind using this. I just want it renamed to use it. Got it. I

Speaker 3  6:28:26
Okay, don't make it Square, just to match sure I'm

Matthias Miller  6:29:33
and of course, it's not going to play The crops, because why would we do that? Because I

Matthias Miller  6:29:58
wait the 1000 back to. 1000,

Matthias Miller  6:30:13
okay, something like that.

Unknown Speaker  6:30:16
I love it. Look at the page. I

Speaker 1  6:30:24
good enough for now, so I can go back to the editor. So just add, where's my Caleb page? So here's what others have to say. Let's add something very similar to what Caleb has done. So what he says is, we have dozens of clients running the spring springboards. I'm just going to drop it into signal. Let's start with this, and let's massage it. And this

Speaker 1  6:31:01
would go above, not below. Having that there is fine as well. Please leave that there. That's fine. And let's take the bit I just put you in the signal and put it above. I would put it before the line. Here's what others have had to say about working with us.

Matthias Miller  6:31:20
Okay? And are we selling our I mean, why not just say, Well, I don't know. We don't have dozens of clients running the power move migration.

Speaker 1  6:31:41
How about this. How about this, something like Countless people have countless businesses have saved 10s of 1000s of dollars using the power move migration method, and I would leave, because here's the thing, and yes, I know I'm pushing it, but even though you personally have not yet done this for countless businesses, a whole lot of people have saved money moving to GHL. And that's undeniable. Is

Unknown Speaker  6:32:15
it hundreds? 1000s?

Speaker 1  6:32:17
I like countless, because we're not claiming any number, and who would ever know?

Speaker 1  6:32:36
Here's what a few of our clients have had to say about working with us, a few of our clients have, have to say, I don't think you need the word had, yep, okay. And then someday, Lord willing, we'll get some actual testimonials about this and make it better. But this is, this is the best way to start.

Matthias Miller  6:32:59
All right, are we good with the landing

Speaker 1  6:33:01
page? Um, let me compare the very bottom footer. So scroll up. Just a hair, please. Just a little hair.

Unknown Speaker  6:33:09
Oh, this one.

Unknown Speaker  6:33:12
I was gonna that's fine, whatever.

Matthias Miller  6:33:15
Well, it was half written, so at least we should write it the whole way. Okay, write

Speaker 1  6:33:18
it the whole way, please. I think having a little bit of text before the next title is good, like basically, And so can you whatever that would actually be? I

Unknown Speaker  6:33:40
uh, 60,000 and still counting? Well,

Matthias Miller  6:34:03
that was back in 2020 2024,

Unknown Speaker  6:34:13
have currently is the Next question down?

Unknown Speaker  6:34:18
Where? Yeah, how many?

Speaker 1  6:34:35
Alt? 70,000 i And

Unknown Speaker  6:34:58
what were you suggesting? I. Uh,

Speaker 1  6:35:01
some variation of, so can you Right? Like, I'm not saying that's the way to say that, but just like,

Speaker 1  6:35:11
you can make the switch, yeah, you can be come one of them.

Speaker 1  6:35:20
Do you want to appeal to something like think of all the things you can do with the money you save? Maybe not.

Speaker 1  6:35:36
I love it. Very nice. Very nice. Okay, next line, so you have a different clothes than Caleb has this is so funny that Caleb's is like, literally what I was dreaming of, even though I didn't read it. Um, I would say the part where it says, This isn't some generic calculator that is begging a question and brings up a thought that I don't think should be brought up. Um, let's just head straight for what it is. This is a full diagnostic calculator of your HubSpot account. Okay, that is the full diagnostic of your HubSpot account,

Unknown Speaker  6:36:14
personalized and your ability to make this move or the change makes the power move, yeah, yeah, yeah, yes. Do we need to say just $5 up there in that subtitle?

Matthias Miller  6:36:40
Does he talk about the price?

Speaker 1  6:36:41
He does. He does it in every CTA as the only place he does it, and his last CTA does not mention the price. Let's see, is it

Matthias Miller  6:36:53
something like four or $5 in the next five minutes?

Speaker 1  6:36:59
Um, that's weird. I thought he said the price somewhere. Where'd I get that from? Okay, I'm sorry. Apparently, where he said five minutes. I thought it said $5

Unknown Speaker  6:37:07
so forget that idea. I didn't know there was a BSL. Where does that come from?

Matthias Miller  6:37:17
That's a how to use the i

Matthias Miller  6:37:26
Uh, sorry, that's how you use the GPT. But if you just embed the chat bot, I just all good. You just say bookmark this page and, yep,

Unknown Speaker  6:37:36
start below.

Speaker 1  6:37:41
Okay, uh, footer? Is there a footer? Will there be a

Matthias Miller  6:37:44
footer? I mean, not more than gonna need

Unknown Speaker  6:37:49
a footer for ads. You got it? Nope. That's all you need. Okay, all good.

Speaker 1  6:38:01
His, on Caleb's, there is nothing after the CTA. And I think that's a good idea. Like literally nothing, literally nothing. Do we want this? So in other words, move that last bit of text above the blue box.

Matthias Miller  6:38:16
But we're not talking about price. Shouldn't this be on the next price on the next page. Yep.

Unknown Speaker  6:38:28
You want all of that on the next page. Okay, am I following that? Right? Yeah.

Matthias Miller  6:38:39
Google some ways I wish we could use the is it too weird to use that same orange for these testimonials,

Unknown Speaker  6:38:51
the blue,

Speaker 1  6:38:55
oh, the same orange that you got behind the page above, behind the HubSpot receipt. Yeah, let's try it, because they do look a little odd floating around like that. Let's try the orange is pretty intense.

Matthias Miller  6:39:14
Why don't they let me customize?

Speaker 1  6:39:20
Oh, I like the gradient. That's cool. That one neat. It's not excellent, but it's pretty neat.

Unknown Speaker  6:39:33
I wonder if I can put, what happens if I put this? Probably gonna screw it up.

Unknown Speaker  6:39:48
No, it does it in the,

Matthias Miller  6:39:54
oh, it moved this around. I.

Unknown Speaker  6:40:11
Oh, Yikes, I'm

Unknown Speaker  6:40:44
three

Matthias Miller  6:40:47
I should know this, 360 minus 45 Is 315 How about that?

Unknown Speaker  6:40:55
Good? I like it. I

Unknown Speaker  6:41:07
All right, happy,

Speaker 1  6:41:10
fairly happy you didn't actually lose that last bit of text that you cut. Did you?

Matthias Miller  6:41:14
It's in my Google Doc.

Unknown Speaker  6:41:18
Okay, I

Unknown Speaker  6:41:25
Oh,

Speaker 1  6:41:33
next thing would be to build the cart page. I

Matthias Miller  6:41:48
Oh, all the emails are going to come from shit Titans. Fine. Do we care?

Unknown Speaker  6:42:00
Seems like we don't.

Speaker 1  6:42:04
Don't. You can mention that in fine print on the what you said, Oh, hey, what is that? Some templates. What have we got? They got a hub, sponsor, generic, interesting. That was

Matthias Miller  6:42:18
me. I was starting to put this together. Oh,

Speaker 1  6:42:22
is there a Whoa, okay, so you're not going to use all that, right? No, okay, can you go back to that new page template? Is there an option for a cart page in there anything? So we don't have to wait? I basically want one that looks like Thrive cart, and I'm trying to find one here quickly, but it's not happening.

Matthias Miller  6:42:43
Um, there was this. Let's delete this. We might as well delete this guy, or we can't create variation. Create from blank,

Unknown Speaker  6:42:53
not it's literally

Speaker 1  6:42:57
blank. No, no, okay, if you go back one more level. See the little, tiny blue back button, up up to the left, way up to the left. Yeah, up right there. New funnel. What good do the from templates? Let's see, ah, yeah. CART, yes. Oh, really. Check out. I

Unknown Speaker  6:43:23
check out

Unknown Speaker  6:43:31
online book orders and

Speaker 1  6:43:50
I try cart again, try sales. What is the SAS marketing software service. Can you preview those? Yeah, there's an eyeball button.

Matthias Miller  6:44:08
Yeah, that one's just, uh, that's way more complicated than

Speaker 1  6:44:10
what we need. It is, although it's got a Yeah, okay, it was fine. Um, that's why I want to thrive cart style the sidebar. I could build one on Thrive cart instead of GHL. Okay, what domain is your Thrive card on?

Matthias Miller  6:44:27
Hey, dot Curt, house.com,

Speaker 1  6:44:31
oh, let's just do that. Then, definitely the fastest way to get this done. I

Speaker 3  6:44:50
wait what? I can't type those. I.

Unknown Speaker  6:45:15
Policy. I'm

Unknown Speaker  6:45:30
okay,

Unknown Speaker  6:45:38
and this is going to come through on their checkout as

Unknown Speaker  6:45:42
codehouse, perfect.

Matthias Miller  6:45:46
Okay, so this is the power move migration readiness assessment. Next processors, let's do authorize.net,

Unknown Speaker  6:46:04
because I get better fees.

Matthias Miller  6:46:07
Product Price is $5 quantity,

Unknown Speaker  6:46:16
no, no per person.

Matthias Miller  6:46:17
Oh, that is not. Never mind. I didn't say anything. Customer, customize your payment notification. I don't think we need to customize that the bumps. We don't need a bump

Speaker 1  6:46:31
bump today, no bump rules today, no affiliates today.

Unknown Speaker  6:46:36
Fulfillment, yeah. I

Matthias Miller  6:46:46
Okay, so then we should have a

Unknown Speaker  6:46:50
new page here. Yep, that is, do you want

Matthias Miller  6:46:57
to call it the power move, migration, readiness

Speaker 3  6:47:00
assistant, Yep, dash, access, sure,

Unknown Speaker  6:47:17
never expires. Gallery, alright.

Speaker 1  6:47:23
Checkouts, right, yes. Good old, let's see. Wow, where's the classic? I haven't seen that. There even was new ones, probably the first one on the top. This one preview. Real quick. I think that's good. Seem good to you?

Matthias Miller  6:47:43
Sure? If we have content to put in here,

Speaker 1  6:47:48
think you have to come up with a couple words, but it shouldn't, okay, click on that one. That's the one I had in mind. Like, basically, it's almost all checkout info and just a tiny little bolted list on the side.

Unknown Speaker  6:48:03
Yeah, I don't remember

Unknown Speaker  6:48:08
having these an editor.

Unknown Speaker  6:48:11
Oh, let's do maybe I have to save,

Matthias Miller  6:48:18
save and get URL, and then I can use the editor. Probably yes,

Unknown Speaker  6:48:24
it doesn't like your browser.

Unknown Speaker  6:48:40
Select,

Matthias Miller  6:48:43
Oh, you gotta be kidding me. You lost everything.

Speaker 1  6:48:46
It really doesn't like your browser. Okay, well,

Matthias Miller  6:49:02
okay, I want to actually save my product, Save Changes. I

Unknown Speaker  6:49:24
less than

Matthias Miller  6:49:27
power migration radius. Is

Unknown Speaker  6:49:33
that good? Yeah.

Matthias Miller  6:49:38
Okay, so we're gonna we have authorized that net $5 pricing,

Speaker 3  6:49:43
no bump, no bump. Rules, next support.

Matthias Miller  6:49:50
Check out. Well, hang on after it. Send them to a URL.

Unknown Speaker  6:49:59
Never. Yeah, how do I

Matthias Miller  6:50:05
save and get URLs? I don't lose stuff because now I am paranoid.

Unknown Speaker  6:50:12
Yep, I

Unknown Speaker  6:50:13
made a product settings check. All right? I

Speaker 3  6:50:25
I do something you want here.

Unknown Speaker  6:50:33
Think it's what else can you edit besides that block at the top?

Speaker 1  6:50:42
I would just simply say, I'm sorry I haven't seen the newest version of this. This is, like, 90% what I'm expecting, and just a hair not, I don't, we don't have an image, right? So, like, what would you do? It's certainly not going to be a gym image. Could be a logo or something, but we don't have it today, and there's it's kind of like not really the time to do it. It would be helpful to have some congruency between the last page and this page. But what would that be? The code house toss logo? I

Unknown Speaker  6:51:24
There you go.

Matthias Miller  6:51:28
I mean, okay, name, email,

Unknown Speaker  6:51:32
phone, Add Phone somehow

Unknown Speaker  6:51:37
to require it. Yeah,

Speaker 3  6:51:47
business name, you require or No, no, optional,

Matthias Miller  6:51:56
okay, name, email, business name, phone number,

Speaker 1  6:51:59
absolutely. I think it looks great. Done. Show Okay, and get rid of the lorem ipsum. And then, if we could just say link, I don't know the right way to say this, but basically assure them that they're going to get the link as soon as they buy,

Unknown Speaker  6:52:25
you know, um, access delivered upon purchase or something. I don't know.

Matthias Miller  6:52:42
What can I insert? You have call outs, but you can't put them in.

Unknown Speaker  6:52:45
Click on it. It's not drag and drop. Maybe

Speaker 3  6:52:49
just click right on it, double click. Oh, it goes up top. Oh,

Speaker 1  6:52:55
it's cheesy. That looks so spammy. It's like straight out of the 90s

Matthias Miller  6:53:03
or J 1000s, anyway, elements. So that means we want elements because they go inside. Um,

Speaker 1  6:53:12
seals are a good idea. Oh, yeah, that's all that stuff's good. The McAfee looking on

Unknown Speaker  6:53:18
this one. Yeah,

Speaker 1  6:53:22
there you go. Anything else you want to add in there?

Matthias Miller  6:53:25
Well, I was actually looking for my

Unknown Speaker  6:53:29
image logo.

Matthias Miller  6:53:32
Oh, now that one, looking for how to add the instant access. You

Unknown Speaker  6:53:37
just want a text box in other words or something? I think so.

Matthias Miller  6:53:40
But I wanted to, I wanted to, I was looking, I was hoping for something that would be like nice, more like a call out kind of thing

Speaker 1  6:53:47
about the feature area, feature see,

Speaker 1  6:53:58
oh, feature means, like, sizes and stuff. Okay, forget that.

Matthias Miller  6:54:04
Okay, so let's go back. We're just way over complicating this over

Unknown Speaker  6:54:10
one last question.

Unknown Speaker  6:54:14
We hijack. I

Unknown Speaker  6:54:25
now it has to have an image. Okay, so we'll just do a we should have

Matthias Miller  6:54:34
done all along, heading,

Unknown Speaker  6:54:40
instant access.

Speaker 1  6:54:49
Maybe that's a headline. Now add some text right below it. I.

Speaker 1  6:55:16
Perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect. I'm

Unknown Speaker  6:55:26
yeah, looking good. What about that damn image? Oh, chat. GBT was making you an image. Was

Matthias Miller  6:55:35
making me an image. I'm not sure if dollar is the right sign, but I

Speaker 2  6:55:40
my face,

Speaker 1  6:55:50
that's fine. Tell me t2 like in the same style, make a graphic of a how? Happy businessman at a desk, like, I don't know what, yeah, let's try it.

Unknown Speaker  6:56:20
Maybe you should have said, like thrilled instead of happy.

Matthias Miller  6:56:32
Oh, that's been a while back. Wrong signal image, the day that could have been much worse.

Speaker 1  6:56:43
Interesting. Are you looking at like a file select box? I cannot see it. Oh, it

Matthias Miller  6:56:47
was a file select box.

Unknown Speaker  6:57:01
The light, there you go. Oh,

Matthias Miller  6:57:05
it's a video that's not what I wanted. Oops. I

Unknown Speaker  6:57:39
Oh, perfect,

Unknown Speaker  6:57:41
yeah, I do like it.

Matthias Miller  6:58:02
Okay and the success page theoretically should not be shown because we're doing a redirect, right?

Unknown Speaker  6:58:07
I believe that's right,

Matthias Miller  6:58:13
but we should theoretically Chase

Unknown Speaker  6:58:22
P

Matthias Miller  6:58:24
power move, migration, radiance, Assistant, Access. I've got my clipboard history, so I should i

Unknown Speaker  6:58:48
Uh, Assistant assessment. So we said every

Unknown Speaker  6:58:50
assessment it is,

Matthias Miller  6:58:53
oh, look at that. That's cool. Now, how do I make a link?

Speaker 1  6:59:00
I don't think you can, because I don't want You to do it up there.

Unknown Speaker  6:59:14
Below. Yes, exactly. I'm

Unknown Speaker  6:59:31
and then can that be? And why should the

Unknown Speaker  6:59:35
sorry, what?

Unknown Speaker  6:59:40
Blue stuff, this, it's not really a link. Oh no, that is the link. That's all good. That's the way it's supposed to be

Unknown Speaker  6:59:58
complete. I. Hopefully that actually works.

Unknown Speaker  7:00:16
GHL, I'm

Matthias Miller  7:00:47
migration readiness assistant,

Unknown Speaker  7:00:59
okay, I'm

Unknown Speaker  7:01:20
There you go. Yeah,

Speaker 1  7:01:22
I'm so happy. Are you happy? I'm happy. So good for that.

Matthias Miller  7:01:29
So now we can turn on and

Unknown Speaker  7:01:32
close all that stuff if you want. By the way,

Matthias Miller  7:01:39
let's make sure we got the latest version. Who knows how that works? And then take it live.

Unknown Speaker  7:01:50
Okay? And then this can go

Matthias Miller  7:01:57
this one. We need close tabs to the right. And

Matthias Miller  7:02:15
it, this one we can delete.

Matthias Miller  7:02:22
And this one is four hours ago, so we're going to delete this

Matthias Miller  7:02:31
one, this guy, we're going to deploy embed.

Unknown Speaker  7:02:38
Then we're going to do we're Wow, you're

Matthias Miller  7:03:14
any debates putting in some kind of snarky comment, but All right, so why is it off to the side? I don't really know, but we could also potentially. I

Unknown Speaker  7:03:47
There you go.

Matthias Miller  7:03:58
Seems like we should say something, and I have no idea what it is,

Unknown Speaker  7:04:15
you've made the right decision, something like that. I

Unknown Speaker  7:04:24
So here they got okay. So,

Unknown Speaker  7:04:52
and now I can't just I'm.

Matthias Miller  7:05:37
Man, I just really do Not I

Matthias Miller  7:06:40
I am literally Hitting decision fatigue and carrying fatigue.

Unknown Speaker  7:06:43
Yes.

Matthias Miller  7:06:46
Do you have a coin flip preference?

Speaker 1  7:06:51
If you pause a moment? How about this? Yep, actually, you could probably use several of those on the go back to the screen, please.

Speaker 1  7:07:15
I like seven out of 10, and I literally use all three of those, that one and the next that one, the one you've already used, and the next one down. Most businesses, fine, yeah. And then, like, click below to get started. Gonna catch up the next one down. I think you already got Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  7:07:38
yes. I

Speaker 1  7:07:45
click, click into the chat bot

Unknown Speaker  7:07:51
below to Get Started. I'm

Unknown Speaker  7:08:11
instead of overcharging, maybe, say costing, I

Unknown Speaker  7:08:28
What about that? Pretty good

Speaker 1  7:08:31
perplexity, or what? What are you? Are you using perplexity? You're using something. Where's your plot or whatever it is. Uh, smarter software is out of their ways for making these are about to take, okay, no, that's fine. I think you, you we got it all good. Yeah, save it already is saved, I guess. And let's see it is that, oh, it's because it's embedded. Oh, so we need to put it into a frame and push the frame to be centered?

Unknown Speaker  7:09:10
Is this? I'm

Unknown Speaker  7:09:26
Oh,

Unknown Speaker  7:09:38
can you search in the filter for left? There's a filter in the Styles box as well. At the top, filter left, no layer constrained. Where not blah, blah margin line left, important. I.

Unknown Speaker  7:10:01
I scroll down a little. Let us roll.

Unknown Speaker  7:10:09
Let's try this

Unknown Speaker  7:10:14
table. There you go.

Speaker 1  7:10:22
This the short code comes from a chat based WordPress plugin or what? Oh yeah, look at that. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah,

Matthias Miller  7:10:29
you're totally I mean, I, I like using short code for custom HTML because It centralizes where it

Speaker 1  7:10:35
all exists. Can you add a word possible to add a frame, literally, like a thin pixel frame around the table or something.

Matthias Miller  7:10:45
Sure think so.

Speaker 1  7:10:47
Order down there, yeah, one, one pixel. It hasn't, yeah, there you go. It's red, little rounding, yep.

Unknown Speaker  7:10:58
So nice. 410,

Speaker 1  7:11:01
15. Oh yeah, it's gonna get cut off that in the corner, off. That's odd. It's

Unknown Speaker  7:11:06
because the iframe.

Matthias Miller  7:11:09
But if we want to, we could have, Hey, we could do it. Why not? I

Unknown Speaker  7:11:45
you did back? Did you mean to do update?

Unknown Speaker  7:11:49
Did I do back? Yeah, wow, good catch. I

Unknown Speaker  7:12:04
There we go.

Speaker 1  7:12:06
There we go. That makes me really happy. So click into the chat bot below. So click, let's go in the chat bot below.

Unknown Speaker  7:12:21
Click, quote, let's go

Matthias Miller  7:12:28
in. Yep, okay, now I'm noticing this title does not call out the power move.

Unknown Speaker  7:12:37
Yeah, there you go. I

Unknown Speaker  7:12:46
And there should be a space,

Speaker 1  7:12:49
yep. And now I don't know that smart move should go before you've made the right or with it. This move is smart. Move up a line. You made the right decision, smart move, you made the right decision. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  7:13:22
So what it does with this. I hate you. Hey, that's pretty good. I

Unknown Speaker  7:13:55
Okay, um,

Matthias Miller  7:14:10
curious about being slightly antagonistic. Grow i

Unknown Speaker  7:14:30
Let's talk about the hubs the

Unknown Speaker  7:14:47
I love it.

Speaker 3  7:14:54
The hubs I am being so contagious. I. Oh, that is awesome. I

Unknown Speaker  7:15:32
way too good.

Unknown Speaker  7:15:35
All right, we need to. I need to, anyway,

Speaker 1  7:15:41
getting late. Okay, sweet. Oh, can you go ahead and rush it through to the end, and let's see if it saves or whatever is supposed to happen. Contact saves an emails or something. Okay, it's supposed to email you, right?

Unknown Speaker  7:15:58
I believe it is supposed to Be

Unknown Speaker  7:16:01
nice to See that work. I

Matthias Miller  7:18:10
six, 324,

Matthias Miller  7:18:20
that's Weird. I go into dashboard.

Unknown Speaker  7:18:35
Oh, it's on and it's on daily,

Matthias Miller  7:18:36
so it's probably going to come

Speaker 1  7:18:39
tomorrow. Okay, that's fine. All good, okay, so can I see the tail end of that again? Oh, you just closed it, but I can find it. Okay, right? Yep, you can close a lot. Close it all

Unknown Speaker  7:18:58
okay, are we? I

Matthias Miller  7:19:04
now we are down to

Unknown Speaker  7:19:06
traffic,

Speaker 1  7:19:09
right? Yep, so I think you already had an ad or something,

Matthias Miller  7:19:16
yeah, let me share this screen, because my Facebook is in a different

Speaker 1  7:19:19
I'm going back to, okay, I actually have the ad section from Kayla's post in front of me. Add one the new method. Video, 60 seconds, engagement objective, this is your unique way to get the end results right. That's where you got the musk method from no CTA. Just a quick 30,000 foot view of the method, broad targeting, but speak to the target audience and the copy. Copy should call out your target audience to keep the lead quality high. We just use Miro for the video. Very visual steps. Okay, whatever that means. I guess it means like a president. Style, but you already have the the VO three AI video where, yeah, it's this one. Can you? Can you play this for me again? Or I'm not gonna scare it, but this is

Matthias Miller  7:20:12
one sure sound, okay.

Speaker 2  7:20:21
Hang on. Oh, I let's do this.

Speaker 4  7:20:37
Your hub spot contract renews next month for $40,000 do you want me to approve the payment?

Unknown Speaker  7:20:43
Honestly, I don't know. Maybe.

Matthias Miller  7:20:45
So how do you know, if you should keep HubSpot, you should use the musk method. Here's how it works. Elon Musk bought Twitter. He sits down and he talks to every single employee and asks him a question, what do you do here? And if he didn't like the answer, they were out of there. He fired them, got rid of them, moved on. Next. Same, same. With HubSpot. You should ask the same question, what do you do for me? And if you do for me? And if you can't answer that within five seconds, you should get it out of there. Fire it. Get on to the next thing. In fact, there's hundreds of companies like you, 1000s switching to a different CRM because they're asking the same question, what do you do for me? And they're finding that they can take all of these different things that HubSpot is doing. There's they can take it to a different CRM, all of the AI tools, the automation, the integrated email, texting, calling, the scheduling, all of these types of things, lead management, task management, and it's all consolidated into a single system. It's easy to use, and they're able to slash costs by like 80% it's called the musk method. You should take a look at the musk method.

Speaker 1  7:21:41
I totally think you should run that. Was that sped up? Or were you talking that fast that day? I was talking that fast that day you are hyped. Um, you also don't normally stutter that much. It's not worth discarding, but sometime, let's re shoot that, or you're just a little bit more clear. Um, but it's fine. It's totally fine. So what do we have here? You got all,

Matthias Miller  7:22:05
hey, so 32nd drop off rate. So at let's go take a look at where it drops off, just for fun. So within five seconds, you should get it out of there, fire it get on to the next thing. In fact, there's hundreds, and that's where they

Speaker 1  7:22:23
disappear, right there. That's fine. Um, let's see that 40. Just think about 40 seconds

Matthias Miller  7:22:35
for me, and they're finding that they can take all of these different things that HubSpot is doing. There's they can take it to a different CRM, all of the AI tools, the automation, the integrated email, texting, calling, the scheduling, all of these types of things, lead management, task management, and it's all consolidated into a single system. It's easy to use, and they're able to slash costs by like 80% it's called the musk method. You should take a look at the musk method.

Speaker 1  7:23:02
That's awesome. Okay, and if you were to do that again, what would you, you know, what? I literally were trying to get an MVP going. And I seriously think that is good enough, better than average, good enough. So, okay, here's your

Matthias Miller  7:23:18
below 1000 here's what I'm confused about though, okay, this one's been running since seven, 920, 5% video view, which means, like, this far, which is Basically everybody, yep. And we've had 6000 video plays, yep, and we have less than 1000 in our audience.

Unknown Speaker  7:23:54
Check open up the settings on that edit.

Speaker 1  7:24:06
People. So you have selected a particular video, people who have viewed at least 25% last 365, days go to one of the ones that's working better. They're not. I mean, they're all under 1000 so who knows one? There's exactly one over 1000

Matthias Miller  7:24:23
that's the saved audience. That's the HubSpot interest

Unknown Speaker  7:24:30
unfold by, okay, why is that one blacker than the rest the second

Speaker 1  7:24:41
one up, the third one from the come down, so one that says saved audience. What's up with that? Why is it

Matthias Miller  7:24:50
blacker than the bottom one? Yes, but we need to accept the terms on this one. Don't

Speaker 1  7:24:55
do it, don't do it. Don't do it. Um, no, it's two more up from that. Yeah, yes, that line.

Matthias Miller  7:25:05
It's another saved audience for the 25% limited by ages 2555

Matthias Miller  7:25:15
it's saved audience version of this custom audience,

Unknown Speaker  7:25:19
and is it still running today?

Unknown Speaker  7:25:23
The video, yeah, yeah.

Matthias Miller  7:25:29
I mean, should we just run we got an inordinately high number of 65 plus launchers. But,

Speaker 1  7:25:37
okay, could that maybe be true for CEOs? I kind of doubt it, but could be how many 1617, 80 year old CEOs are there in the world?

Matthias Miller  7:25:49
There's a fair number of 50 and 60 year old execs. I don't have a 65 plus, but

Unknown Speaker  7:25:59
we're CFOs.

Speaker 1  7:26:01
Yeah, it could be true. I feel like it's unlikely, but it could be true. Um, I don't know about the teenagers either, but anyway,

Matthias Miller  7:26:12
well, it's not much to worry about, yep.

Unknown Speaker  7:26:15
So

Speaker 1  7:26:18
super, huge amount of women, too, like that. That's just, it's fine. Let's just leave it for now, I'm thinking that we should just let that run. And it is still literally running right. Oh, you've got a video viewing gate. He said, to use an engagement objective, you've got a video view objective.

Matthias Miller  7:26:48
Video view is a type of engagement. So auction engagement, but I thought he said video views maximizing three plays,

Unknown Speaker  7:26:56
literally nobody.

Speaker 1  7:26:58
Yeah, no. Somebody said, which is fine.

Unknown Speaker  7:27:01
What did he say? I

Unknown Speaker  7:27:33
Oh, that's real helpful. I

Speaker 1  7:27:44
it's Shaw, yeah, I've got, I've got the link to it here, ready, set here it comes in your

Speaker 3  7:27:55
signal. I'm uh,

Matthias Miller  7:28:11
engagement, engagement, objective.

Unknown Speaker  7:28:17
But what type of engagement?

Speaker 1  7:28:21
I assumed he meant like, like, shares, comments.

Speaker 1  7:28:33
Maybe it doesn't matter that much. I it

Speaker 1  7:28:46
just strikes me that I mean it objectives are real. And I'm thinking like, You got way too much women on there in the views. And I'm kind of thinking Facebook is just showing the video to people who are willing to let it play without their brain turned on, which might be why it's so showing to so many women. And possibly, if we change it to engagement Instead, it might produce something better. I

Speaker 1  7:29:42
I asked ask it, which objective, which campaign objective? It's

Speaker 1  7:29:54
interesting that look at that actually says engages with the video there. Do you see that? I. Gages.

Unknown Speaker  7:30:06
It did not, yeah, I

Speaker 3  7:30:26
comments, likes and shares. Where is it pulling that from? Or who have

Unknown Speaker  7:30:37
that's another audience, by the way we need to build I

Matthias Miller  7:30:43
I'm not getting comments likes, and I should check my page, but,

Speaker 1  7:30:49
yeah, but that's because you're running into viewers, and Facebook knows the difference between the two.

Matthias Miller  7:30:56
So should I

Speaker 1  7:30:58
you should start a new campaign, same deal. Code house, video engagement.

Matthias Miller  7:31:07
This is, this is video. We should call this video engagement because that's what it

Unknown Speaker  7:31:15
is. We should have

Unknown Speaker  7:31:18
that one should be called views because that's what it is,

Unknown Speaker  7:31:24
video abuse.

Speaker 1  7:31:28
Are you using ad set? Level budget? Yeah, okay, then,

Speaker 3  7:31:35
yep, a new ad set. Yep. You got it duplicate? Okay? New original campaign, one copy,

Matthias Miller  7:31:48
engagement, type, post, engagement, yep, maximize, engagements, Yep, yeah.

Speaker 1  7:32:11
Detailed targeting interest people who match HubSpot. I mean, technically, that should work. Matthias says, you know, Matthias, like Caleb says, to do broad but I'm thinking, I mean, since HubSpot is an interest that's available, surely that's exactly the right people. Seems like it's the size. Yeah, and change that one to say engagement,

Speaker 3  7:32:37
to do it. Um,

Unknown Speaker  7:32:51
it's good. Do you

Speaker 1  7:32:54
want to change the other one's budget to five a day as well? They are both, I thought they were both on five. Okay, right? We need to go to your audience manager and make a new audience for people who engage, unless you have one already.

Unknown Speaker  7:33:17
I'm not sure that worked. It's yeah, I think that's correct. Yeah, we need the right page. And then it's, let's see what's in there,

Unknown Speaker  7:33:30
with any poster ad. Well, that one, I

Unknown Speaker  7:33:44
Is that fair? Let's start with that. Yes.

Speaker 1  7:33:52
Say done. Do another one, please. Let's do it just a hair differently, custom. Let's do video, meta sources video. And then is there a there is nothing in there that says engagement, right? No, you just cancel that then.

Unknown Speaker  7:34:17
Okay? And then

Matthias Miller  7:34:19
he said, what was that? 25% of views that he recommend, 25% recommend, 25% one, yeah, yep, so we can conceivably take this then.

Speaker 3  7:34:38
This is obnoxious, but include more people. That's a custom audience.

Unknown Speaker  7:34:49
I wanted to edit this one. What

Speaker 1  7:34:53
over there on the far I can check the box and click, okay. I. Edit down there, yep, and then,

Matthias Miller  7:35:14
then, let's rename this to I'm do

Matthias Miller  7:35:28
I want to limit it to 25 to 55 or am I being to,

Speaker 1  7:35:32
um to 65 maybe, I think, I think it is reasonable for CEOs and CFOs and all that to be over 55 Yeah, 6465 64 Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  7:35:46
64 Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  7:35:51
that's more like it. Okay, you got an error down there in your lower

Unknown Speaker  7:35:57
corner. Yeah, I need to look at that. I don't

Matthias Miller  7:36:07
think I'm actually using that one. But anyway,

Unknown Speaker  7:36:10
okay, so let's do okay,

Matthias Miller  7:36:18
little new leads. Ad, literally,

Unknown Speaker  7:36:27
it's one.

Matthias Miller  7:36:30
Let's just mix this for now. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  7:36:42
go. I was deleted. Thank you.

Speaker 1  7:36:56
So so click the Select Content. The

Unknown Speaker  7:37:08
is it that 1.9 this guy, that's also real, the post this guy, as

Matthias Miller  7:37:22
if it's not obvious, but the fact that it's

Speaker 1  7:37:25
yeah, there you go. Okay, so select, we'll be able to preview it on the next page. That's fine. Yeah, that look right? Texas, right and everything. Yep. I

Matthias Miller  7:37:50
There we go. All right, so that's add one running now,

Speaker 1  7:37:55
okay, so now we need to add two retarded value post. Run this to people who watched 25% of ad one and then elsewhere. He says, you know, engagers as well, and there's no reason not to do both. This post is all about helping them see why your method works and why it applies to them. We've tested a short case study and an ad that explains the math behind the method and why it works.

Matthias Miller  7:38:35
But then surely there's some kind of I

Matthias Miller  7:38:44
what media goes with it?

Unknown Speaker  7:38:49
He didn't say, my guess is it's an image.

Matthias Miller  7:38:57
And this would be a is this a messenger?

Speaker 1  7:39:05
No messengers at number three, this is, this is the middle layer of the sandwich. It this one also does not have a CTA. It is just a retargeting value post, okay, I think this is pretty smart, by the way, video, first value post, second call to action is last.

Matthias Miller  7:39:29
So then we have auction engagement. So this is

Unknown Speaker  7:39:35
HubSpot value post.

Unknown Speaker  7:39:42
Should uncheck the box that says, share with your other ad sets. Thank you.

Matthias Miller  7:39:56
Why does it say? Why is it an engagement? Post, engagement, but conversion location? Is on

Unknown Speaker  7:40:00
your ad

Speaker 1  7:40:04
has gone wrong. We can This is not an engagement ad. Says conversion ad set something went totally wrong with this. Can we delete it? Yep,

Matthias Miller  7:40:16
this is an auction of engagement type. Whoops. With post engagement with maximize engagement on the post.

Speaker 1  7:40:26
Well, okay, now I'm really worked out. Where was it saying that about? Okay, anyway, I must be crazy. That is so weird.

Unknown Speaker  7:40:37
Spot

Unknown Speaker  7:40:39
post, this was 250 right, 25%

Matthias Miller  7:40:52
can't read what it is, but that one's it

Unknown Speaker  7:40:59
good. Seems. Good

Unknown Speaker  7:41:15
change content,

Unknown Speaker  7:41:18
or

Unknown Speaker  7:41:20
we're gonna create any post. I'm

Matthias Miller  7:41:40
is there some kind of emoji I should use for these?

Speaker 1  7:41:50
I would Yeah, like a checkbox. Check green, check mark, green X, red X, that's the bad side, right, red in that case, red X, red in there. I think it'll work.

Matthias Miller  7:42:15
Cross mark emoji. I

Matthias Miller  7:42:39
is ready the right word?

Speaker 1  7:42:41
Does he say to do that on this post? The

Unknown Speaker  7:42:51
I'm going back to the text. I thought he read

Matthias Miller  7:42:54
somewhere the add one is even supposed to have a CTA, like a comment or message.

Speaker 1  7:43:02
No, his post, I mean maybe, but his post literally says no CTA on ad one, maybe he meant no CTA in the video

Matthias Miller  7:43:16
this, this says, even add two. He says no CTA. Mm, well,

Unknown Speaker  7:43:31
coming from

Matthias Miller  7:43:32
from his GPT that he shipped me, that might have old process data in it, but

Speaker 1  7:43:37
interesting because it's just simply different from what his post and HB says,

Matthias Miller  7:43:43
Well, should we just do No? CTA,

Speaker 1  7:43:48
no, you may as well. I can't see how it would have hurt, because it's just going to increase your engagement and give you people who are interested, if they are interested. So let's do it,

Matthias Miller  7:43:58
and then what should we I

Unknown Speaker  7:44:05
be power move. Comment, power move. Yep, that's good enough. Okay, what photo

Speaker 1  7:44:20
time for another graphic. And what about, what about using one of the graphics we made for the page, probably the one that talks about

Speaker 3  7:44:35
either the keep going this guy, old way, new way.

Speaker 1  7:44:44
Okay, hang on. Hang on. A second, maybe one of the ones I had that I didn't get over to you. Good enough. Um, I.

Speaker 1  7:45:00
You know, what happens? Scroll up for me, just a hair tiny bit more. How about just using that one for now, we can split this guitar out of this eventually, but for right now, let's do that. Yeah. I

Speaker 3  7:45:27
Oh, hey, welcome to tomorrow. I've never say again, welcome to tomorrow.

Matthias Miller  7:45:34
It's not the perfect size. Do we care?

Speaker 1  7:45:36
No, we don't care. I could throw it in camera. Okay, I'm hoping that Caleb will actually answer my request to see A demo, and we'll

Unknown Speaker  7:45:45
get somewhere.

Speaker 3  7:45:54
Okay, good, yeah, I I

Speaker 1  7:46:06
think it's pretty eye catching, don't you? Or you do publish, let's just look Okay, nope. That's correct placement to edit. No, that's correct advantage plus, click Edit on. Advantage plus, yeah, that, let's just turn it all off. Off.

Unknown Speaker  7:46:26
Okay,

Speaker 1  7:46:29
tracking events. You don't need to track events. I'm trying to think this through for a second. You have any tracking set up on your website, you have the Facebook pixel installed,

Unknown Speaker  7:46:39
I don't think so.

Unknown Speaker  7:46:44
Okay,

Unknown Speaker  7:46:45
should probably do that.

Speaker 1  7:46:55
Some point. Did your chat? Yeah, I think I saw your chat base had the ability to have the pixel in there.

Matthias Miller  7:47:09
Should I publish these or Not? Yes? Do? Yep. I

Matthias Miller  7:47:56
uh, right we don't have we're not driving traffic to the website yet. I'm

Unknown Speaker  7:48:28
there you go. All good.

Speaker 1  7:48:37
You just made that under your shed Titans account. You don't have a separate ad account for code hosts?

Matthias Miller  7:48:44
No, I don't, because you were talking about running CRM offers directly to the shed Industry Insights written here. But is that wrong in a

Speaker 1  7:48:55
perfect world that separates them? But it's not worth dealing with today, right now. I

Unknown Speaker  7:49:04
looks good, yep, yep, I'm

Matthias Miller  7:49:27
no idea where the best place is to

Speaker 1  7:49:29
does your theme have a spot? What theme is that just WordPress? Insert HMK setting. There is no good place in WordPress. By default, you can either edit a theme file, which you can lose in an update, or you can install a plugin already. There's like Header and Footer Scripts. There's intelli, I can't quite remember what it's called, intelli, something, mm. If that's all good, anything?

Unknown Speaker  7:50:06
UDP code,

Speaker 1  7:50:09
header, footer seems all right. I've not seen that. Yeah, Header and Footer Scripts, yes, I have seen and use that one a bunch. What is Oh, yeah, 20 200,000 active installations. That's it. Yep.

Unknown Speaker  7:50:21
Yep. And does this go in the

Unknown Speaker  7:50:26
better typically, there you go. Ah, fun.

Unknown Speaker  7:50:40
Did not like your JavaScript

Speaker 3  7:50:44
did not okay, so there's meta, thrive, cart settings.

Speaker 1  7:50:59
That's not what I wanted. Oh, that was what you wanted. You were on. Okay. Anyway, that's fine. Check out tracking

Unknown Speaker  7:51:06
Facebook,

Speaker 1  7:51:08
just the Id only out of all that code might need a code editor for a second.

Unknown Speaker  7:51:18
I know smart.

Matthias Miller  7:51:23
Enable CPI.

Unknown Speaker  7:51:25
That is cool.

Speaker 1  7:51:29
It's just gonna take a long time. Yeah, let's skip that for now. We totally should do that later on, but it's not worth it right now Tonight.

Unknown Speaker  7:51:40
Dashboard,

Speaker 3  7:51:52
now, chat, interface, footer,

Unknown Speaker  7:52:02
or that say

Matthias Miller  7:52:07
disclaimer, link, but it's not

Unknown Speaker  7:52:11
analytics, okay,

Speaker 1  7:52:16
activity, maybe wrong. I thought I saw it there, but maybe not. I'm looking for that's

Unknown Speaker  7:52:29
what they say. Okay, well, that explains that

Speaker 1  7:52:39
I missed it a little bit it was saying to use, I saying to

Matthias Miller  7:52:42
use just embedded on a page, like we're doing or something. Okay. Do I want advanced matching or not? That's fine. Sure that's all good.

Unknown Speaker  7:52:55
Okay? Google says

Unknown Speaker  7:53:01
just to use a

Unknown Speaker  7:53:04
third party tool, which is fine.

Unknown Speaker  7:53:09
Where did this one

Unknown Speaker  7:53:14
you got? What is that? Got two of those? I haven't interesting. I

Matthias Miller  7:53:24
I know great, but it's late,

Unknown Speaker  7:53:27
all good, test event. I

Unknown Speaker  7:53:55
clicking on, okay. I mean, it's showing this here. Looks good to me.

Speaker 1  7:54:01
That the same one that is that actually

Unknown Speaker  7:54:08
is this guy now has that 12175, yep. Okay, I think we're good. All right, so then

Unknown Speaker  7:54:24
what next?

Unknown Speaker  7:54:30
Messenger ad.

Speaker 1  7:54:34
Go back to the engagement, to the ad number two, yeah, value post, thank you. Go all the way down into the ad and go to the bottom, just turn website events on there and then paste what I wrote and signal into there, yeah,

Matthias Miller  7:54:58
but we're not pushing out. To a website,

Speaker 1  7:55:01
um, but if any traffic drifts through, then, you know, it might maybe, um, publish. We should do that on the video post as well. You know, just in case, I

Unknown Speaker  7:55:23
Yeah, yep, and publish,

Speaker 1  7:55:31
we should turn off all that advantage, plus stuff on that as well. Yep, I'm good yes on the video. You're down a little bit. No, no, right there.

Speaker 3  7:55:46
There we go. Publish, yep,

Speaker 1  7:55:56
sneaky. Turn them all off. Okay, that was interesting. Publish.

Unknown Speaker  7:56:04
Okay. Now are we ready for

Speaker 1  7:56:06
the I stress it's something is still not published. See the blue up there? Yep,

Unknown Speaker  7:56:13
what's the air? I

Speaker 1  7:56:15
don't have to hit Publish again. Who knows? Okay. Now we can do the messenger ad you've already got. So

Unknown Speaker  7:56:29
okay, so we have a is it? Is it elites?

Speaker 1  7:56:32
I don't think so. It's to message. It's literally not lead forms. It's a messenger conversation. It goes, shall read. He said, I'm reading his instructions. Goes to everyone who watched ad one or interacted with that too. So literally, both audiences, actually, literally the same audience that you just added to add to. No, this would not be engagement. Is this engagement? No, this is called a conversion mess. They consider messenger a conversion. Okay, that's the question you're asking me. I'm sorry, I don't know where that's under, probably leads.

Unknown Speaker  7:57:14
Let's go back to the other one.

Unknown Speaker  7:57:20
Try a leads. Is that the one you want to use no reason not to no

Matthias Miller  7:57:27
reason not to start generating leads by chat semester, right, looking for

Unknown Speaker  7:57:31
Yeah, leads, and then they call it yep,

Unknown Speaker  7:57:39
yep, go Haas.

Speaker 2  7:57:40
I seems low, but

Unknown Speaker  7:57:53
small audience, super so good looks good to me. Okay, I would

Unknown Speaker  7:58:07
call it messenger ad, yeah, yep, okay,

Unknown Speaker  7:58:20
give me that again?

Speaker 1  7:58:22
Yes, so and I have little to no suggestions for the image. Really wish Kayla would show us something.

Unknown Speaker  7:58:39
You could do that just for now that one that you're pointing at.

Unknown Speaker  7:58:56
Original, yeah, there you go.

Unknown Speaker  7:59:00
All right, and then we have

Unknown Speaker  7:59:06
this video

Speaker 1  7:59:09
work and, and you got this out of his GPT, yeah, um, let's just skip the video part for now and Get this done. We can make a video later. I

Unknown Speaker  7:59:51
That should be fine, far as I know. I'm not sure where description shows i.

Unknown Speaker  8:00:10
I want to turn all that off. Scroll down. There's more of them. Oh, there's more.

Unknown Speaker  8:00:21
Sneaky little Zuckerberg, okay,

Matthias Miller  8:00:28
okay, chat, messenger, um,

Unknown Speaker  8:00:33
type anything into that description

Matthias Miller  8:00:35
box the header down here.

Speaker 1  8:00:38
Okay, that should definitely stay the way it was. But what about the next box down? Or is that

Unknown Speaker  8:00:50
might not have room?

Speaker 1  8:00:54
Type a couple letters again and wait for a second. It's like nowhere. Okay, let's just leave it empty. Send people to chat with another page. Call to Action, all the rest. Message template. Do we want to do an instant? I think we might. Is it? I guess Facebook doesn't really do the reply, instant reply thing. Do they?

Unknown Speaker  8:01:27
I don't really know. Oh, high level does. Could?

Speaker 1  8:01:34
Cannot keep this open. The questions like, no, yeah, let's do the next one. No, this fault, no, no, no, no, no. What about advance? Template, name, reminder, allow, key, oh, to end, huh, yeah, I don't know how this works. Cancel all that. I guess it's trying to use a form that you have though like, whether you like it or not, see that converted form one business owner contact, maybe do that preview in Messenger, and let's see what it's trying to Do. I don't think it's that.

Speaker 1  8:02:22
Can you cancel this click that preview and no? That preview? Yeah, that one probably opening your messenger window somewhere.

Speaker 1  8:02:40
Nope, that's crazy. It's like they're forcing you to use the form.

Unknown Speaker  8:02:59
What does this show this though,

Speaker 1  8:03:02
see over there on the right says, create a template or select an existing one. In order to publish we like have to do it, Whether we like it or Not. I

Unknown Speaker  8:03:31
let's actually I'm

Unknown Speaker  8:04:09
instead of one pager to save link, I'm

Speaker 1  8:04:51
probably that one that says people who answer yes go directly to the completion i.

Matthias Miller  8:05:02
If not. Now, do you disqualify? Sure? I

Unknown Speaker  8:05:33
Yep,

Speaker 1  8:05:40
and then I can be like, yeah, sorry, okay, no problem, yeah. And then something like, yeah, there you go.

Unknown Speaker  8:05:56
Or, instead of ever change your mind, more like, I

Unknown Speaker  8:06:03
yeah, I love it. Yep,

Unknown Speaker  8:06:07
that's all good. Do you have to do that? Probably I

Unknown Speaker  8:06:27
I fly.

Unknown Speaker  8:06:31
Think it's good.

Matthias Miller  8:06:38
Oh, well, we probably don't want to. I two.

Unknown Speaker  8:06:45
What is that spare one?

Matthias Miller  8:06:46
What's that $20 a day? Okay, this guy needs to get, get on

Unknown Speaker  8:06:54
this one's This

Matthias Miller  8:06:57
one's got nothing in it. So I'm just going to delete.

Unknown Speaker  8:07:11
Okay,

Matthias Miller  8:07:18
looking at spending $15 a day, I'm

Unknown Speaker  8:07:48
okay, there it is.

Speaker 1  8:07:52
We made it and it's not three in the morning. It's 130 though.

Matthias Miller  8:07:57
It is 130 though.

Unknown Speaker  8:08:01
Yay. Congratulations,

Matthias Miller  8:08:04
dude. This is wild. Um,

Unknown Speaker  8:08:08
any questions in theory, it's on.

Matthias Miller  8:08:12
Theory, it's on. Only question is, what's fair?

Speaker 3  8:08:16
How horrible is this? What's fair? What compensation for what you

Speaker 1  8:08:25
literally don't worry about me. I'm happy. I got to do this with you, and if a customer actually shows up in the door, we can talk about what it takes to make the customer happy and what's left over. Okay?

Unknown Speaker  8:08:39
I trust you. You know, I do. So what was I going to say? The only thing is that some of that was a little bit MVP ish.

Speaker 1  8:08:52
Probably the worst part would be those ads. And this is just me, but I really want some info from Caleb. I can see in messenger that he read my request, but he didn't answer. Probably that means he was busy or out to lunch or something. So I messaged him directly. I had already messaged him before, and he gave me the link as a DM, and I DM him back. I wonder, could you instead of DMing him, I'm assuming he didn't already give you an example, I did he would you mind taking a different track? So go back to the actual Facebook post, and in the post as a comment, say, Hey, Caleb, whatever you want to say, you know, I want to give this a shot, or I'm interested, or something, and then literally ask for the swipes in the post itself. He says he will give, how does he word it examples? I'm going to find it in just a second.

Matthias Miller  8:09:56
I feel slightly funny because I had actually sir. Had a conversation with him about

Unknown Speaker  8:10:05
about having him do it.

Matthias Miller  8:10:07
Yeah, the ad sequence posted somewhere above in the thread. It's in the thread here.

Speaker 1  8:10:14
He has examples already in the thread, yeah,

Matthias Miller  8:10:19
somewhere in the threads,

Speaker 2  8:10:20
I I

Unknown Speaker  8:10:25
am hunting and hunting,

Matthias Miller  8:10:29
I clicked through the wrong place and I lost it all. I

Matthias Miller  8:10:48
but it might also have gotten deleted.

Speaker 1  8:10:52
I am looking, looking, looking, nothing's coming through yet. Caleb keeps telling people I posted the link somewhere above, but yeah, you're not joking. It's like it's gone. Let me set my filter back to all, drop the link.

Unknown Speaker  8:11:11
All. Is it cool? Waiting for somebody to approve. I

Speaker 1  8:11:27
i had Okay, and I had actually asked him already, but he didn't. I

Speaker 1  8:11:51
I keep telling people I posted it somewhere above, but literally, it's not wonder if Facebook just ate it. Did

Matthias Miller  8:12:02
you expand it to all comments? In case it's like,

Unknown Speaker  8:12:04
Yes, I'm expanding everything.

Unknown Speaker  8:12:10
Well, the good news is I

Matthias Miller  8:12:39
did anyone ever receive the one pager with The examples.

Matthias Miller  8:12:58
I think I have expanded them off. I

Speaker 1  8:13:19
Are you okay? So you don't want to message him because you had started talking with him about implementation or something.

Unknown Speaker  8:13:29
Here, I'll do this.

Matthias Miller  8:13:33
I can just the two feel a little weird, but I'm happy to message him and just say, by the way, I have a friend who saw your post in nhB where you mentioned ad swipes,

Speaker 1  8:13:46
the ad sequence layout is what he actually said. So he didn't quite an example. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  8:13:53
see, that's just the GPT stuff to add sequence layout. That's not an actual ad that he's offering. That is a very thinly veiled, to stay way to say,

Speaker 1  8:14:06
I think he kind of fooled us all a little bit.

Unknown Speaker  8:14:09
I think so.

Matthias Miller  8:14:13
Any guys Money, money is worth out of it,

Speaker 1  8:14:17
we could offer to pay him for an hour of time. I don't know. What do you think

Unknown Speaker  8:14:29
we could potentially I

Matthias Miller  8:14:53
it. But it seems to me like, Okay. If you really want to. By the way, this is the first time you posted in the group, so that's pretty telling. He's not an he's an NH nhB harvester,

Unknown Speaker  8:15:15
correct? Yeah. I

Unknown Speaker  8:15:31
Okay, I just posted a comment. Back to the main post itself. I'm have

Speaker 1  8:15:49
Did you notice that on Caleb's one page funnel, those CTAs actually just collect name and email? Did you see that that must be how you got to some of the things you saw.

Matthias Miller  8:16:08
I have the um, the checkout page link somewhere.

Unknown Speaker  8:16:14
Let me just show you, real quick. I'm going to share screen for a second.

Matthias Miller  8:16:20
The other thing that we could do, by the way, is see if any of us have mutual friends, where it shows what their business is, and see whether he's running, if

Unknown Speaker  8:16:33
he's running traffic.

Unknown Speaker  8:16:36
Yeah, I like it. Can you see my screen pulling it up, yep. So watch this,

Unknown Speaker  8:16:44
dink, see that, yep.

Unknown Speaker  8:16:53
Watch this. You still watching Yep.

Unknown Speaker  8:17:00
Okay, you ever seen this before? I have not

Unknown Speaker  8:17:13
okay, not bad. It's literally his cart page. I

Matthias Miller  8:17:24
He literally says, Here we spend a lot of time developing this tool. And then literally, he says, you can build this out in 20 minutes.

Speaker 1  8:17:32
Okay, the two are not necessarily contradictory. They probably are contradictory. They don't have to be ah, it.

Unknown Speaker  8:17:45
Where is my

Speaker 1  8:17:47
so he does one pager to cart page, which is essentially what we just did. I

Unknown Speaker  8:18:04
Okay.

Speaker 1  8:18:06
Okey doke, so when we come back for round two, if there is a round two or whatever you have in mind, I just think that the next thing that would be worth improving would be the images on those ads

Matthias Miller  8:18:20
when recording that video and replacing that post with a video

Speaker 1  8:18:23
I wouldn't replace, if you can stand it, I would do both. Let's see what works. Sure I don't I get the feeling that his chat, I mean literally, as we built this out tonight, we hit like, three or four different places where his chat bot told you something different than his post said, and I'm guessing that his chat bot is giving you generic I'm not saying it's all generic, but I'm saying I think the discrepancies are probably open. AI just saying what it thinks it should say, whereas Kayla's post is probably more what Caleb did, and yet the chat bots giving you more details, and Kayla's post is lacking details. So some you win, some you lose. But I think, I think we should. I think we're just going to try a few different things in order to find the truth. Yep, I want to show you one more thing, please, and then I will shush and go away.

Unknown Speaker  8:19:27
This is an idea for an alternative ad number two, just a random, crazy idea, but I kind of like it.

Unknown Speaker  8:19:41
So

Speaker 1  8:19:43
everyone's using these Twitter style creatives these days. He's got a cam Canva template for all I know he's a harvester too, trying to get Canva affiliate links, but I do not care. I actually think he has a point on I. Uh, some, some other alternatives would be like memes and other funny stuff. But this kind of Twitter screenshot looking thing does make for kind of an eye catching ad, right? I think, I think we, I think we could and should try some stuff like this, variations, I would agree, oops, there it is. Okay. All done. I'm thrilled. Imagine that we built an entire campaign, funnel, cart, everything in one.

Matthias Miller  8:20:38
So when we started, when

Speaker 1  8:20:40
one session around five. No, actually, it was really closer to six, because we got because I interrupted you several times,

Matthias Miller  8:20:49
rushing into the hour, probably, maybe you gave me a call at 530 Yep, and now it's 130

Speaker 1  8:20:59
I've been tracking time since I first called you, and it's eight hours and 20 minutes so far, 21 minutes.

Matthias Miller  8:21:06
Okay, so about eight hours, yep, um, all right, can we okay real quick, yeah, before we before we drop, yep, things to test slash fix, which is what

Speaker 1  8:21:21
the ads. So add two and add three. Need, I'm just going to call it alternative images. We need to test a different image.

Speaker 1  8:21:39
All ads need other Right? Like we just simply need B, tests, C, test D, E, F, G, because we don't know what's going to work. Change the script, change the style. Test video, test images. That's, that's the life of a media buyer, right? Always coming up. That's the test that that last image we made, which we did just use in one of those ads, and it's on the page. It's the one that has the 297, price in the image that came out a little bit wrong. We decided to use it so we didn't burn up more time. But it looks cheesy to me if you look back at Caleb's original. It was this, like the old way versus the new way. And somehow ours looks like a it looks really cheesy because it's now like unlimited contacts, unlimited whatever, $297 it looks like it's the one thing out of everything we built that I don't like the feel of it. It just screams, like, buy my $2 software,

Unknown Speaker  8:22:54
or it doesn't feel professional.

Speaker 1  8:22:56
Yeah. It Like It misses the mark entirely. It definitely missed the old way versus new way, feeling that we were trying to mimic from Caleb's sales page.

Matthias Miller  8:23:16
The landing page doesn't capture emails, the cart page is missing. Copy Plus, FAQ,

Speaker 3  8:23:31
I don't want to airplay, there you go. Can you hear me? I can Yeah. You hear me, yeah.

Matthias Miller  8:23:41
I'm wrapping up so it can drive home.

Unknown Speaker  8:23:48
So

Matthias Miller  8:23:51
is there anything else loose ends? I just want to caption before,

Unknown Speaker  8:23:56
completely before we drop off.

Unknown Speaker  8:24:00
Nothing comes to mind. Okay,

Matthias Miller  8:24:07
seem good, yeah, seem good. Well, thank you for your help. Hopefully this turns into something for

Unknown Speaker  8:24:13
both of us. Yeah, I hope so.

Speaker 3  8:24:15
So, all right, soundly,

Unknown Speaker  8:24:19
yep, you do. Good night, good night. Bye.
