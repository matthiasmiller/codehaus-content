So this morning recorded, I'm sorry, good podcast. Recorded our first episode this morning. You did, yeah, there's no link there, but here, Addison would probably, I'll throw it in the in this chat probably,

Matthias Miller  01:15
probably give about a week timeframe, but my co host was describing it to one of his friends, and he's, like, his friend was, like, I was sending him the the title and description, like, like, we basically just riff for Howard

Speaker 1  01:32
lawn. What pub in the desert? What is this? Yeah, that's the podcast. That's pub. I pup,

Speaker 1  01:48
you very naughty Mennonite, you, I

Matthias Miller  01:51
know very naughty Mennonite, so, and he's so, he was describing it to one of his friends, his friends like, oh, well, that sounds like it sounds like Seinfeld. It's like a show about nothing and about everything, but from a Jesus perspective,

Unknown Speaker  02:12
shoot hub in the desert. That's funny.

Matthias Miller  02:18
I have for a long time wanted to do a podcast, and this has been by far the most I've always tried to make a business reason for it, and never, anyway, it just never really, never really could justify it never made sense. And then finally, I'm like, This is not a business thing. It's a hobby. People tell me, I need a hobby. Here's my hobby.

Speaker 1  02:46
Well, hobbies turn into businesses, and sometimes businesses turn into hobbies.

Unknown Speaker  02:52
That's That's fair,

Speaker 1  02:56
but most of the time, either one gets their started about the on either side,

Speaker 2  03:00
oh, the opposite side, yeah, this is true. This truth. Okay. Well,

Speaker 1  03:12
do you want to end early and I go spend the time working on late fees? Or do we do knock out some more

Matthias Miller  03:19
stuff? I would be, I would actually think that would be the most productive use of time. Is if you would

Speaker 1  03:28
go do that, go figure out late fees, late fees,

Matthias Miller  03:31
convenience and surcharges, if you have that, I feel like, yes, there are stuff we could crank through. I'm losing steam now. It's been a very long week. Thank you very much. And

Speaker 1  03:48
well, okay, so then, in the interest of good brain power and work that I need to go do anyway, let me go do that. I will work on a bunch of the think things and see if I can nail some of this down. And yeah, and

Matthias Miller  04:11
then if it's all the same to you, I am planning to not give up more early morning time slots on Wednesdays. And so if you're able to keep the rest of Wednesday's free forever, long, you're going to want to

Unknown Speaker  04:28
go Wednesdays. Are you pretty free?

Speaker 1  04:36
You're saying you like the you're saying you like the 8am thing, or you want to go later,

Matthias Miller  04:40
which I'm gonna need to go. I'm gonna need to go later. I'm gonna start using the the early my, my morning for other stuff. So I currently have you down for 1130

Unknown Speaker  04:51
um, on the six,

Matthias Miller  04:53
yeah, on the six, or like, blocking out. I can start around 11 or 1130 most Wednesdays. Yeah, but I wonder if we should do a session like like plan for the next number of weeks, at least, to meet around 11 or 1130 and then do another one on Thursday. And if we need to do maybe throw one in Friday, I suppose that's probably the best day for you.

Speaker 1  05:18
So the only hiccup with Wednesday the sixth is that I could push Mark back a little bit. We were going to work on some wholesale dealer portal stuff. I have from I have from 11 to 1230 we could do a 90 minute session, but then I would have from two to 4pm after that,

Matthias Miller  05:42
do you want to do two blocks, nine to 90 minutes at 11, and then

Speaker 1  05:47
listen, I prefer because after 90 minutes, my brain, my my usage goes down. I understand

Unknown Speaker  05:57
so two to two to 330, or 230, to four.

Speaker 1  06:02
Uh, uh, I would say two to two to 330 All right, and that gets us 290 minute blocks in there. Yep, is there. There is nothing wrong if somebody else is writing in the dev spec. If I go into edit mode and just search my stuff, as long as I'm not trying to write, nobody cares. Nobody cares. Okay, all right, just want to make sure this is, this is one of those things, because there's a number of people that are that are hitting that same document and pretty regularly. It's like knowing when you can write and when you can't write. And

Matthias Miller  06:46
there's also, if it's more useful to you, there's a cch only switch to this tab. You could also you if you want to, you can hit the ellipsis, and there's a probably all you need is develop, developer export as a PDF, and if it makes it any easier for you, crank, crank, like you can also do that,

Speaker 1  07:25
and that copies the whole thing out into a PDF, correct. And then you can copy sections and work on it, and then just gotta know where to put it back in

Matthias Miller  07:33
again. Or you can also do client export, which exports it as an RTF, which you can open in Word, or you can upload to Google Docs and and then, as long as you, I mean, you could do change tracking if you wanted to, and then just integrate it back in as an idea. I've got too many.

Speaker 1  07:49
A lot of times I just um, if I Okay, that's good to know. Perfect.

Speaker 2  07:53
Sweet. Good Well, good luck. All right, enjoy. Thank you. All right, later.
