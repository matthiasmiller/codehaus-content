Unknown Speaker  02:54
Be good man. What I need here?

Speaker 1  02:54
Why keeps doing that. Be good math what I need here. Yep, I am good. All right. Okay. let me, uh, if you can show the same item entries that are on the same day or back to back work days, you. I lose you all year down there. Hey there, yeah there we go. Got it. Are we screen sharing. Nope, screen sharing. there. Hey there, yeah there we go. Got it. Um, I Why keeps doing. Are we screen sharing? Nope, not screen sharing. Do you want to give me one minute? Let me Yeah. I mean, I can't, I can. I wanted to put something together. It's going to take me just a few minutes. I did not have, I did not have much time at all between last time we talked in this morning, but I did. I think it's, I think we could spend a few minutes. I don't think we can get everything done, but I think we can come up with with a concept. And so I'm looking at the email that I sent you. Are you doing something right? Use something else you want to do yet? Yeah, walk me through that. Walk me through the email. I'm are you looking at it? I got it here. Yeah, okay, so, yeah, full, full proof program, design process. Is that okay? I call it that. Sure I like it, you know, I don't know it's Yeah, okay. Well anyway, in order to show orders with incorrect quantity entries, Yeah, or I should have said work days, but and attach a number each of those matching item ID entries, we can go in and correct the quantity. Then when they're cleared up, the shown entries will go away, clear up, etc. Is that what we that's, are we on the same page? Is that? Yeah,

Matthias Miller  02:57
Yep, I am good.

Unknown Speaker  05:33
yep,

Speaker 1  05:35
that's right. Okay, so I was just laying in bed since morning for a little bit. And I thought about, oh, we show these and attach a number to them, and we go in and correct the quantity entry, but how are we going to correct the quantity entry that's wrong when we don't see the right amount, when we we don't know off top our head, what is the right amount. So

Unknown Speaker  06:12
I guess

Unknown Speaker  06:14
I'm thinking, I have to try to

Matthias Miller  06:17
I could give you a a sage order search tool that lets you search by date range and item to find matching sage orders that you could look it up that way.

Speaker 1  06:33
Would that be on the same screen? Or would that, should that be on a different screen?

Matthias Miller  06:38
That'd be a different screen? Probably just use it for, probably just use it for, for this project. I don't, I don't think most

Speaker 1  06:48
So, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that would be cool if we could go back and look it up. Course, I should be able to do that anyway. That's where, sure Rick should be able to help with something like that anyway, but

Matthias Miller  07:06
that's up to you. I haven't

Unknown Speaker  07:07
figured No, I haven't figured out how to What did you say sage?

Matthias Miller  07:15
If you would be able to search for sage orders? I mean, you're literally in three minutes, three minutes. Sorry, that's the wrong system.

Speaker 1  07:31
Should be able to do that. So go in and search for old sage borders. Just search to i Oh

Speaker 1  07:45
say. Jordan, so when we find these

Matthias Miller  07:55
incorrect, do you want to search by due date or invoice date? Um,

Speaker 1  08:07
the good question. I mean, I think our invoicing happens pretty quick, same day, I'm guessing like that all the time, not 100% sure. Like, if Rick's not here, that's just a crazy question that I don't know off top my head. Okay.

Matthias Miller  08:33
Well, we'll start with think today seems same. We can, we can do that, and we can always change it later. We're not

Speaker 1  08:48
and date, yeah, yeah, that sounds good. Matt,

Matthias Miller  08:52
all right, so if,

Speaker 1  08:59
yeah, we just need to look back, either in sage or on the sage print out. There's print out like every day, and I'm pretty sure I have a copy. One of the guys on his paper trail is supposed to end up in my hands, just so I have a paper trail of schedules that were

Matthias Miller  09:34
so, I mean, here's, here's a search that. I mean, I'll put this. I can put this on the menu for you then, but search by date, where you could see the search by search by item, with the date range and the sage orders from from there, I think it goes back.

Speaker 1  09:52
Well, actually, I'm just thinking if I could just open sage and running a running a. Running list of sage orders, and I could just scroll back through time. I should be able to do that. Okay, yeah, we should be able to do that here in house. I don't know why not, so we'll try that. So if you show it that way, attach a number that would be in the Excel program, right? Yeah, and then for silver loom going forward, I like your idea of showing the ones where item quantity entries are less or more than the order same thing, we go in and clean it up and how you show that you were saying you would show it at the bottom, something like that.

Matthias Miller  10:55
I have an idea. I'm trying to okay this. Give us a visual.

Speaker 1  11:04
I'm not. I'm looking at my email right now. That's fine, but I'm sorry. Actually, I'm not. I can't get you any email same time. There we go. Give me,

Matthias Miller  11:17
give me. Give me. Just a minute here. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  11:20
take whatever time it's

Unknown Speaker  11:30
what's going

Speaker 2  11:33
on? Yeah, well, a little bit

Unknown Speaker  11:42
downhill. I'm

Unknown Speaker  11:49
sure that's the problem taking them, but, but yeah, and then pick yourself about half an hour later. We'll move on birthdays at 905

Speaker 1  12:03
doing birthdays at 905 so already wants to be here

Unknown Speaker  12:08
for that. Martin, I

Speaker 3  12:20
Sam Martin,

Matthias Miller  13:00
Don't you just love going on vacation?

Unknown Speaker  13:03
Oh yeah, man, I love it. Why that was that was something else, not related to vacation. But

Matthias Miller  13:20
let me, let me see if I can. I don't know if we got here. We do one other thing on this guy here, and then I'll show you this. You had talked about the date. Well, this is actually need a work order.

Matthias Miller  13:59
Let's stay. Needs to show up in here. And then let's add a I'm

Speaker 2  15:22
I she can go.

Speaker 1  15:32
She can go before 845, to

Speaker 2  15:38
take it down. 845, yeah, back up and then, well, Tom, what about

Speaker 1  15:50
she'll be no we, because George and I meet with the twins right after birthday, and she can come get you while we're meeting opportunities.

Unknown Speaker  15:58
Yeah, that'll work. That'd be fine. Yeah, Oscar, do.

Speaker 3  16:15
It's fine. I

Unknown Speaker  16:26
me this weekend,

Unknown Speaker  16:35
every

Unknown Speaker  16:38
year, next week, come back. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  16:44
yeah, Matt, you were

Matthias Miller  16:45
saying, what, what, um, what date should we start seeing things? What's the minimum? What's the starting due date where things should start tying out?

Speaker 1  16:59
Sorry, you start seeing things tying out. I'm sorry. I'm not

Matthias Miller  17:04
like we should sorry in the assembly tracker, we should see starting back in, basically, when did, what's the due date? When for orders? When John started putting these things in. Like,

Speaker 1  17:21
okay, so, yeah. So we have everything in, supposedly from January 120, 24 until now. Okay,

Matthias Miller  17:31
well, I'm going to exclude before July because we like before July 4, because there's a bunch of old stuff in there. Um, but then, I mean, now we have, and the new stuff should all be tied out here. Let's do a, let's, let's show the item code in here.

Speaker 1  17:54
Worry, I'm not sure whatever you're talking I mean, we are talking about the old data, right? Or you I'm

Matthias Miller  17:59
talking about the new data. I'm talking about the way to view. Maybe this is an out, okay, in my mind. In my mind, okay, here's my thought process, the Excel spreadsheet. I know what I need to do. I'm pretty comfortable just doing it, and there's probably not much that do you want, unless you want to have that together in such a form or fashion that you can, you can get somebody started on that before you

Speaker 1  18:36
leave. No, that doesn't have to happen. No, okay, that's not gonna happen anyway.

Matthias Miller  18:41
So in my mind, I got enough to to get that knocked out. So that's done. When you get back

Unknown Speaker  18:47
talking about July 1 you were saying,

Matthias Miller  18:49
but I'm saying the new entries, like anything from anything towards the beginning of July, we should be we should have entered in the new directly in the assembly tracker, it should be tied out to

Speaker 1  19:04
us. Sorry, sorry, July, um, sorry, June 23 was a Friday four or five, June 26 or June 23 maybe would be safer. Well, there's discrepancies in June of missing things, let's

Matthias Miller  19:24
just say July, for the sake of not accuracy, but simplicity. So here it is,

Speaker 1  19:32
you're saying that, that where you're going to save proof stuff in silverland.

Matthias Miller  19:39
Yeah. Like,

Speaker 1  19:42
I'm just saying John started using silver loom, like, in latter part of June,

Matthias Miller  19:50
all right, but like, here, here is a RW, have 111, 51 I mean, there's a bunch of we're. Orders here that aren't tied out to Sage orders.

Unknown Speaker  20:04
Okay,

Matthias Miller  20:07
let's see. Maybe this is,

Unknown Speaker  20:12
does that? Does that? Does that matter?

Matthias Miller  20:14
Yeah. I mean, if we put in the list of things that aren't tied out, like, okay, like, if we go all the way to the top here, yeah, like, just on the 29th here's, like, here's FA zero, 17 a there's no sage order on it. And maybe this is one where it was a partial. And,

Speaker 1  20:36
yo, no, I understand. But if, but if we're gonna the only way that's gonna possibly get double checked is if you go back to June 23 and everything prior to that is going to be checked via Excel,

Matthias Miller  20:58
Right? Which is why, what am I missing? I'm not worried about really old stuff for this. This part, I'm just if we have a screen up here that says, Here, open sage orders. Here's what was ordered. Here's what we know was assembled. This will help us stay on track going forward to make sure that everything gets tied out right.

Speaker 1  21:21
But you're saying is versus the more old stuff that's in there, the more work we're going to have to, have to do.

Matthias Miller  21:27
No, I'm just saying we have new stuff that's not tied out to Sage order to,

Speaker 1  21:34
yep, because he's not, he's not, he didn't do that with everything, or he didn't enter, yeah, because he's not tying them out properly or something.

Matthias Miller  21:43
Yeah, and I know that. I know he mentioned the issue that if it's a partial, you can't, okay, like, let's, let's take a look at this one, fa, zero, 17, a This order was we should put in the order creation day to

Speaker 1  22:08
I'm not sure what to do, Matt, I need to go get my driver's license picture taken, and I'm okay.

Matthias Miller  22:12
Well, I'm good. If you're good, I can't I can, I can. The big things on the list are, I can clean up the Excel file. I can work with with John to make sure that we can get the partials entered and keep George on track. And we can touch base when you get back.

Speaker 1  22:32
Well, oh, man, I want to finish. Can we just talk on the phone here right away? I'll just come off the zoom and I'll call you on the phone? Scoring. Awesome. Thanks, Matt, yeah.
