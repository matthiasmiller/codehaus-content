Matthias Miller  02:44
How's it going? All right, fun times

Unknown Speaker  02:47
you don't take it.

Matthias Miller  02:50
No, we're not messing around. Where?

Unknown Speaker  02:52
Remind me, where are you located? Oh,

Matthias Miller  02:56
Colorado.

Unknown Speaker  02:59
What city, Canyon City.

Unknown Speaker  03:04
Boy trying to remember, southwest

Matthias Miller  03:06
of Colorado Springs, west of Pueblo and highway 50, close to the Royal Gorge. Yeah.

Speaker 1  03:16
I mean, I'm sure I've driven right past it. Just, I've been through. I've been through so many times, coming from California, but, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  03:31
what you got,

Matthias Miller  03:34
all right, connection, request,

Speaker 1  03:37
putting myself for years was into a put it in a bottle. Is that? Is that the saying? Or is that exactly how it's worded? I put it in a bottle

Matthias Miller  03:54
somewhere. It is, but I don't know if I

Matthias Miller  04:04
we don't have to. Yeah, that wouldn't make sense, though, in this kind that doesn't make sense, does it? I

Unknown Speaker  04:25
um, to

Unknown Speaker  04:38
give. I use that to gift

Matthias Miller  04:41
15 minutes that's weird. I.

Matthias Miller  05:07
E I don't know.

Unknown Speaker  05:11
I don't know. I like the other version more.

Matthias Miller  05:16
Sorry, which other version

Unknown Speaker  05:20
you add something about to get straight to the point.

Speaker 1  05:29
I like how tight. I like how tight this is. If you could get it to three lines, that would be awesome.

Matthias Miller  05:38
All right, here's this one.

Speaker 1  05:48
I just like the today I help executives bring their 100 proof versions of themselves.

Unknown Speaker  05:58
I it to me.

Speaker 1  06:02
Yeah. I start, I always start with a 15 minute clarity. Shot, start with a few minute clarity. Shot,

Matthias Miller  06:17
I mean, this is P 94 that's getting real tight, depending on their name, I got a 300 cat.

Unknown Speaker  06:30
Yeah, British

Unknown Speaker  06:34
proof. Maybe I

Speaker 1  06:48
maybe you just need to say if you'd like a clarity, a 15 minute clarity shot.

Matthias Miller  06:56
Well, the the other way to do this too is sell the connection request first, then sell the call.

Unknown Speaker  07:05
Oh,

Unknown Speaker  07:06
I misunderstood. This is just the connection.

Speaker 1  07:15
Let me give me a second, because I, I should have a template around a LinkedIn outreach.

Speaker 1  07:29
I'd have to dig it out. I, I'm, I think you don't make an offer until after the connection, or put this out until Usually, you want to identify. To identify something in common, like, Hey, I saw this blah blah, because this is kind of getting a little straight into it. I

Matthias Miller  08:10
so you would do this apart from the offer, just straight up connect, apart from that. But everybody knows when there's a connection request, that there's something coming. I want to beat them to the punch. I want to let them know what's coming and have them sold on it by the time they accept the connection request. It's pretty aggressive, I know each

Unknown Speaker  08:46
it is, it is pretty, pretty fast.

Unknown Speaker  08:52
I mean,

Speaker 1  09:01
I had a whole outreach sequence, and it was very tight. Then I won't waste your time,

Unknown Speaker  09:19
if you would,

Unknown Speaker  09:21
if you would like a clarity shot

Speaker 1  09:30
to help you get to 100 I don't know like to help you get to I

Unknown Speaker  09:52
um,

Unknown Speaker  09:59
let's. Connect.

Speaker 1  10:13
Oh, you know what's missing, the cocktail chat was nice because it told you it was a chat. The clarity shot doesn't, doesn't, kind of connect to

Unknown Speaker  10:26
a 50, oh yeah, if

Speaker 1  10:27
you say a 15 minute clarity shot,

Matthias Miller  10:39
I Well, what if you did Do this? I

Matthias Miller  11:16
What's the right I

Matthias Miller  11:45
it's still extremely direct.

Speaker 1  11:52
You know, I was missing is the truth as a raw ingredient, the only thing you need to bring is the raw ingredient of or do you mean

Unknown Speaker  12:07
I, I mean

Unknown Speaker  12:12
I almost,

Speaker 1  12:16
I almost want to say, You first you saw one step at a time maybe, maybe there's a world where you could just go straight, straight to it. But,

Matthias Miller  12:32
okay, let's what if? What if we built this around? I

Matthias Miller  12:46
we know that these people targeting folks connected with let's just pick Andy Mason as an example. So that should be relatively easy to build a connection request. That's like,

Unknown Speaker  13:05
Hey, I noticed we have this person in common,

Matthias Miller  13:09
where, how do you how it feels? So maybe because it's done so awkwardly, um, everybody says, oh, we have some synergies, and we have this, that and the other, and, yeah, which is really blah, blah, blah. And then, even if it's personable, how do you not make it feel like,

Unknown Speaker  13:54
maybe, like it's

Speaker 1  13:56
okay? Here's a thought. The connection could be like floating the idea of a cocktail shot, and then he was like, hey, and then once you're connected, it's the clarity shot. Okay, that maybe that's being a little too cute. I one this. This came to mind. I don't want to lose it. Tim Francis has the great wine he quotes someone on and it's kind of part of his origin story. It's a

Speaker 1  14:46
hell is meeting the man I like could have been, and what if you had right after your first line, I distilled who I was into 100 proof version. I.

Unknown Speaker  15:00
Hell is okay.

Unknown Speaker  15:02
Hell is meeting.

Unknown Speaker  15:12
Hell is meeting the man I could have been. I

Speaker 1  15:25
that. And that's that's like, Okay, if you want to be direct, we'll just go straight for the specific unmet need and dig it in there, right? Be like, Hey, this is wasted potential.

Unknown Speaker  15:48
Today, I hope

Speaker 1  15:53
may you could you might even say this work has changed my life, and I, and I want to offer you, you won a 15 minute clarity shot on the house.

Speaker 1  16:16
So it's almost like you're indebted to this

Matthias Miller  16:21
to this thing that happened, which

Speaker 1  16:24
it's bigger than you, and you're coming from a spirit of sharing, which is like, Hey, if you have good news, people expect you to share the Gospel. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  16:35
right. What was? What

Unknown Speaker  16:38
was you delete? I

Matthias Miller  16:43
Today, I help executives with discussions your interest. You could say, oh, yeah,

Speaker 1  16:51
I think you could say that. You could say that he that the people I help best are, are executives

Unknown Speaker  17:09
who want to be The 100 proof version of themselves,

Matthias Miller  17:20
and mixing that, yeah, which takes us to 336 which means that we're back to

Unknown Speaker  17:37
what you can do. Um,

Speaker 1  17:46
you could just take what's the limit? Word limit,

Matthias Miller  17:50
300 character limit. Okay,

Speaker 1  17:57
can you cut and paste this third line into your document just to preserve it. Yep, because I do like it,

Unknown Speaker  18:09
and that's that's if

Speaker 1  18:19
I'm not sure the language, but if this would serve you, if you if you want to, if you want an open chat with the with the bartender, no, no, if this would serve you at the very end,

Unknown Speaker  18:38
let's connect

Speaker 2  18:40
like I boom,

Speaker 1  18:50
wait, okay, whatever you paste it in the

Matthias Miller  18:55
right little scratch pad. I don't

Unknown Speaker  18:58
want to lose anything. Hey, look at that.

Unknown Speaker  19:08
Well, it's certainly tight.

Speaker 1  19:15
So it's permission based. I like ending. I

Matthias Miller  19:23
Yeah, right. And then this still leaves plenty of room for a Ben. I see we're both connected with I see both whatever, blah, blah, blah, the personal thing,

Unknown Speaker  19:36
okay, life, dash and dash changed my life,

Unknown Speaker  19:49
and

Unknown Speaker  19:52
and the executives I have helped, or whoever you've served, i.

Matthias Miller  20:00
I mean, the leaders might be, yeah, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  20:09
Can you? Can you find a real and dash? Oh, yeah. This is me being like, obnoxiously picky, and I think the world should have more M dashes. So I'm just tired

Unknown Speaker  20:25
of doing your part. That's a really

Matthias Miller  20:32
good Unicode M dash,

Speaker 1  20:34
if it would, if it would serve you. I'm not

Speaker 2  20:40
if if,

Unknown Speaker  20:52
if,

Unknown Speaker  20:58
this I like this is better.

Speaker 1  21:19
Okay, is there a too rough of a transmission from 100 proof to hell this meeting, you know, a wise man said that hell, Hell is no hell is

Matthias Miller  21:34
you said it specifically. I

Speaker 1  21:46
No, I modified the quote, it's, it's, it's, it's true that hell it's true that hell is meeting the man I could have been. It's true that hell is meeting you. Don't even need a quote. That's fine, or maybe it's good.

Matthias Miller  22:17
Hell is i

Unknown Speaker  22:25
i think it's an anonymous quote.

Matthias Miller  22:35
All right, so, and then this would be, I

Speaker 2  22:40
All right,

Matthias Miller  22:46
so then it's then It doesn't really matter from there, then it's a, I

Unknown Speaker  23:27
you know what?

Unknown Speaker  23:29
Yeah, what that? It's

Speaker 1  23:31
true that hell, it doesn't belong there. Cut it and put it right after waste your time.

Speaker 1  23:56
The reason is the distilled I distilled means you found the solution, and then you say, this work has changed my life.

Matthias Miller  24:05
Yes,

Speaker 1  24:08
right problem, promise and proof, although it's not very specific proof, but I won't waste your time. I

Unknown Speaker  24:24
I feel like the one. Oh, go ahead. It's been said that hell is meeting the man you could have been. Hell is meeting the man you could have been. After diluting myself for years.

Matthias Miller  24:56
Okay, here's where I feel like. This is the. Piece I feel is that the union with truth, like the values piece, maybe it is strictly problem. This is the bleeding neck,

Matthias Miller  25:20
suddenly an interesting way that speaks my language, and this guy doesn't mess around.

Matthias Miller  25:41
Which leaves

Matthias Miller  25:49
like almost nothing for any personalization.

Unknown Speaker  25:53
That's why you say I won't waste your time,

Matthias Miller  25:56
fair enough, which is really on point.

Speaker 1  25:59
I don't I still feel like there's, there's a the first and second lines. I'm not sure if the transitions clean cut between. I won't waste your time. It's been said.

Matthias Miller  26:17
Well, I mean, you could, you could do this?

Unknown Speaker  26:21
Yeah, well, in that case,

Speaker 1  26:27
you're making about yourself, then you say you wouldn't say you, you'd say, I could have been

Matthias Miller  26:33
man i It's been said that hell is meeting the man I could have been. You could just say, hell is meeting the man that could have been.

Unknown Speaker  26:43
Yeah, that's great.

Speaker 1  26:49
And you could sign off and say, yours something about freedom,

Unknown Speaker  26:57
your i

Unknown Speaker  27:04
If You could say I wouldn't say friend yet

Unknown Speaker  27:08
you're I

Unknown Speaker  27:27
just say I maybe I'm here for I am here for You.

Matthias Miller  27:39
All right. And then message one then becomes, I

Matthias Miller  28:02
don't this is not the right what's the

Unknown Speaker  28:13
Priority shot?

Speaker 1  28:20
You don't even Need a management sales pitch. I

Unknown Speaker  29:23
this is where

Unknown Speaker  29:32
you need, what need, like a hand raising free offer and the 15 minute chat. Could be it just trying to think, why is there any reason?

Speaker 1  29:57
Is it something where you you. You, you know, leave a little trail. I don't know what is cookie trail, cheese trail, breadcrumbs,

Matthias Miller  30:10
breadcrumbs,

Speaker 1  30:12
or is it something that is the nature of a LinkedIn connection, that the moment they connect, is the high this the highest likelihood that they would want to chat.

Matthias Miller  30:30
I've already framed it that I don't waste time, right? And so I mean it's possible. Go ahead. Yeah, yeah. I

Unknown Speaker  30:43
you could say,

Unknown Speaker  30:46
oh, oh, you Ah, you run,

Unknown Speaker  30:49
you run a truth distillery.

Speaker 1  30:58
Now you went from bartender to running a distillery, okay? Distillery, if and if you'd like A clarity shot, and you're right. I

Matthias Miller  31:47
that's not quite right, but

Speaker 1  31:49
I think a testimonial is more for a page. It's almost like you're tooting your own horn,

Unknown Speaker  31:56
right? A little bit. Um, it

Matthias Miller  31:58
could be in my profile. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  32:09
And this is

Unknown Speaker  32:11
maybe you say, you know, the classic, hey, I help this person achieve this result. And you tailor it to the person you're you're

Unknown Speaker  32:27
connecting with.

Matthias Miller  32:33
Seems like it's trying too hard. I don't know why. Okay, um,

Speaker 1  32:39
are your shots? Well, then maybe at least describe what. What are you getting? Clarity around like three bullet points. Like,

Unknown Speaker  32:51
do you have I

Speaker 1  33:03
so the way, the way I was planning it for my I'm not anywhere near there, but I called them identity knots, flow blockers and business bottlenecks. And those entangle you. So it's like, is there like a trifecta

Unknown Speaker  33:27
of of evil?

Matthias Miller  33:30
Well, I mean, is confusion, timidity and isolation? Okay,

Unknown Speaker  33:37
here's,

Unknown Speaker  33:38
here's the thought, what if you put, yeah, write that down. Good.

Matthias Miller  33:47
Was it confusion?

Unknown Speaker  33:58
Oh, what

Speaker 1  33:58
if you go, what if, can you bring up the Venn diagram with the heart mind, and

Matthias Miller  34:14
Will I think I can? Yeah,

Speaker 1  34:20
I would suggest figma for editing. Okay, have you ever tried it

Matthias Miller  34:29
for mockups, but never for software mockups, but never for graphic editing?

Speaker 1  34:38
Maybe, maybe this better. I don't know. I'm just, I'm just, I love figma so much. Let's see

Unknown Speaker  34:48
the

Speaker 1  34:57
what if you say, what if you say, clarity. But the three ingredients are clarity, clarity of mind, or maybe you just say the three ingredients are like, you're gonna walk away with clarity. I

Matthias Miller  35:34
I mean, I wonder, too, like this is very

Matthias Miller  35:41
masculine. Well, I don't know that that's a good term for it, but very masculine energy, I suppose, during clarity and courage, and then we've got comfort that's like,

Speaker 1  35:56
connections a little better than comfort. Yeah, it is.

Speaker 2  36:00
I I mean,

Speaker 1  36:05
it's like most people don't think of the Holy Spirit as a comforter, right? Like it's, it's not, and he's the ultimate advisor. So, uh,

Matthias Miller  36:23
um, I hate to cut this short, I'm gonna have to drop here for another call.

Speaker 1  36:26
Yeah, I think the three ingredients, it's like, Hey, I run the truth distillery and I hand out a 15 minute clarity shot so you can better connect with yourself and have the courage

Unknown Speaker  36:48
yourself and have the courage to show up as the hunter said,

Speaker 2  36:53
Oh, look at You. Okay, that's pretty good.

Unknown Speaker  37:01
I'll let you go.

Matthias Miller  37:04
230 brilliant, appreciate it,

Unknown Speaker  37:06
sure. Bye, bye.
