Unknown Speaker  04:13
Hey, Mark, made some progress.

Matthias Miller  04:16
You're tremendously patient with my

Unknown Speaker  04:21
all my stuff.

Unknown Speaker  04:23
You're good. I mean, you've got stamina. I'm impressed.

Matthias Miller  04:27
So here's the epiphany. Part of this whole thing is, let's go control collaborative strategy. So first message, then right out of the gate, Ben. And this could be changed, but I've been rebuilding my life and collaborative strategy.

Unknown Speaker  04:49
It means

Matthias Miller  04:52
letting go chasing outcomes and letting the right things emerge. And to that end, I'm handing out. 15 minute clarity shot calls. I'll take seven minutes to let you experience 100 proof version of me. The other eight minutes are yours. You may want to go deeper in the conversation, tackle a particular problem, share what you're working on, pass on an introduction.

Speaker 1  05:16
Ask for a referral. Hey, those are all value adds. I like that.

Unknown Speaker  05:21
I and

Matthias Miller  05:25
all with the trust that the right thing things will emerge into being. Aim for this if so, shoot over like

Unknown Speaker  05:42
you have the right things emerge twice.

Matthias Miller  05:46
I mean, we could

Speaker 1  05:49
all the, I mean, you like with talking about wins, all the trust will will get you, get you a win. And I've been then I've been rebuilding my life on,

Speaker 1  06:14
okay, rebuilding my life on collaborative means i

Speaker 1  06:23
It means, yes, we Want to show that you've done the work. You've you've

Unknown Speaker  06:43
I'm handing out is kind of nice, because it's like,

Matthias Miller  06:52
I don't know which good

Unknown Speaker  06:56
it's almost like, I'm handing out. It means like, it is a gift. It is a it is like seven minutes to

Speaker 1  07:19
I'm not sure if 100 proof has a any context in this message,

Unknown Speaker  07:32
right?

Speaker 1  07:34
It can, it can, it could work. It just doesn't have the other

Unknown Speaker  07:42
thing. Clearly, clarity shot calls,

Unknown Speaker  07:46
Oh, you're right. Clarity, shot ties to 100 proof.

Matthias Miller  07:53
You can even say I

Matthias Miller  08:03
I mean, you could tie this. I think the one thing is, well, but is this a seven minute pitch?

Unknown Speaker  08:09
It feels like it's about you, right? I would just say, I wouldn't even say what the agenda is,

Speaker 1  08:34
if you're not going to detail like, hey, so So am I getting this right? You do, straight off the bat, a seven minute memo, yeah. And what do you do to prepare for that?

Matthias Miller  08:51
I just dive in. Man,

Unknown Speaker  08:54
right? But is there anything before?

Matthias Miller  08:57
Oh, there might be a few, like an opening sentence or something. I mean, I could open the call with,

Speaker 1  09:05
do you do any, any pre prep work? I know you don't know the person, but do you pray? Or do you

Matthias Miller  09:13
may maybe a few minutes before, but

Unknown Speaker  09:19
you're just on. Okay, I'm just on okay.

Unknown Speaker  09:40
I think in this case,

Speaker 1  09:47
you will, the purpose of the call is to help them to get to 100 proof, right? You could say, after the clarity shot calls, um.

Matthias Miller  10:02
Here. I

Speaker 1  10:03
mean, you get to, my goal is for you to get to 100 proof,

Speaker 1  10:16
to the 100 proof version of yourself, or just

Matthias Miller  10:19
to the 100 proof view, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  10:29
I almost Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  10:41
ah.

Speaker 1  10:43
You like deleting all those all those bullets were good, telling you to save stuff.

Unknown Speaker  10:56
Okay, I think that line is much better. Let me,

Unknown Speaker  11:17
you know, maybe this is where you leave people

Unknown Speaker  11:27
maybe this is where you say, like, Hey people, people say that. You could list these, you know you may want to or

Speaker 1  11:42
share. Not testimonial form, but just the experience form, people leaving feeling like you read their mail like

Unknown Speaker  12:01
you know, a ground, grounded identity in their in their work.

Unknown Speaker  12:17
Uh, courage.

Speaker 1  12:21
I think this is where you could say, hey, the clarity shot is made up of three ingredients. I really, I really think, wow, take, take a cocktail.

Unknown Speaker  12:42
The clarity shot

Speaker 1  12:49
the truth, truth that leads to clarity, clarity of mind. What was it of of mind?

Matthias Miller  13:00
Truth that clarity,

Unknown Speaker  13:07
where's my?

Matthias Miller  13:14
Find my all my things are horribly named, and I can't find anything besides this down so we can See it. Clarity is when truth meets your mind. Here

Unknown Speaker  13:51
connection with your authentic self. I

Unknown Speaker  14:03
and courage to

Unknown Speaker  14:10
pursue

Unknown Speaker  14:13
the project. I don't know what I

Speaker 1  14:23
oh yeah, there you go. If there's a way to bring clarity in the first word, first,

Unknown Speaker  14:33
clarity, connection.

Unknown Speaker  14:48
Maybe you don't need clarity. Clarity. It's kind of weird to have a clarity shot with three i.

Matthias Miller  15:07
Uh, clarity, actually, Jonathan, clarity, we said you knew with true clarity,

Unknown Speaker  15:19
clarity of purpose.

Matthias Miller  15:26
We didn't have connection. You could say clarity by connecting to the with the truth.

Unknown Speaker  15:31
Oh, you could say I

Speaker 1  15:59
What about clarity on what on on, on, like business freedom or what like, what will make You free, or clarity on how to get unstuck. I

Speaker 1  16:28
clarity on your path forward, clarity clarity around your goals,

Unknown Speaker  16:35
clarity on Your path you

Unknown Speaker  16:52
on your on your path, forward, okay?

Speaker 1  17:11
I know that it these might not. It might not be a perfect message, but if you keep chipping away at what these three ingredients are, I think you'll hit on like we could pursue lots of different messages, but I think if you keep honing down on this, it's a good angle. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  17:42
So then

Matthias Miller  17:46
this is in the wrong place. Everything's ordered wrong. I

Matthias Miller  18:00
I think you could have i

Unknown Speaker  18:20
i don't even know if you need people who have left feeling

Matthias Miller  18:36
it kind of captures. I

Matthias Miller  18:47
i Love, love, love, love, love that this has just come back around all about them.

Speaker 1  18:52
Yeah, it's putting them forward first with the help you move one step closer to the 100. Oh, one step closer feels, I don't know if that's redundant, with courage to take the next step.

Unknown Speaker  19:14
Connection with with your authentic

Unknown Speaker  19:21
underproof.

Unknown Speaker  19:33
We could put, what if you put after cursed the neck. Take the next step,

Speaker 1  19:49
maybe something like without these three ingredients, like your life gets diluted. I. Are all like all of your efforts get watered down. I don't know what you

Unknown Speaker  20:12
it's true.

Speaker 1  20:26
Can you close the canvas? Canva, sure, and then make it a little bit bigger. Thank you. That's better. I

Matthias Miller  21:05
if we just said My goal is to is to help draw out the 100 proof version of you. I

Speaker 1  21:23
You know what? You know what letting go is of outcomes. It's what it's it's when you trust God and he has the power steering. You still have your hands on the wheel, Yeah, but you're not the one who's really having to, you know, make a go that he

Matthias Miller  21:51
draws people to Himself. He I plant. He brings the increase all that stuff. It's very true.

Unknown Speaker  21:59
Oh yeah,

Matthias Miller  22:17
I would I mean, I feel like there's something to play on here, like, I mean, what is the right term? Small dose, high,

Speaker 1  22:34
you could this is where I still like the hell quote, I like, you know, most people

Unknown Speaker  22:52
are living at like 10% right?

Matthias Miller  23:01
What's the is,

Unknown Speaker  23:08
what are approved levels in alcohol? I

Speaker 1  23:22
what, what I Okay, here's a contrast you could, you could for the people who might not be all keen on alcohol, you might even say most people

Unknown Speaker  23:40
almost like they're just sedating themselves with because of, it's like, because they're not winning, because they're not alive to the, you know, The story they want. There, there might be like a

Matthias Miller  24:20
40 is like upper end of fortified wines with extra alcohol added, okay, getting past the beer and wine, but not spirits are, you know, like A rum whiskey, tequila, 80 to 100

Speaker 1  24:41
that are, uh, okay, so.

Speaker 1  25:10
Oh no, no, no, keep the my goal, yep,

Matthias Miller  25:18
my fight for brevity is

Speaker 1  25:21
hell is meeting the person we could have been. You could have been, you could have been they could have been they, because you're talking about those 40 proofers. Give me a give me a Minute. I'll be right back. Right

Unknown Speaker  26:22
um, I think you need, I think you need to put my goal is to help draw.

Speaker 1  26:35
I almost think the 100 proof version of you needs to go before 40 proofs. Leaders. Here's

Unknown Speaker  26:53
here's where.

Speaker 1  26:59
This is the messaging from the agency, is go from ordinary to exceptional, yeah, which you could say is like they're, they're, they're happy to be above average, but not exceptional, but no, but don't, but fall short of being exceptional.

Matthias Miller  27:34
So hell is gonna be the hell quotes gonna be repeated from the connection request, which isn't

Speaker 1  27:38
necessarily bad, it's just Oh no, that's okay. Then take it out and say short of exceptional short, short, but it's almost like short of the exceptional of what they know is possible. It's almost like the average they know. I i

Unknown Speaker  28:02
Just

Unknown Speaker  28:06
readers better than ours,

Unknown Speaker  28:18
short of the

Speaker 1  28:24
it's not, it's not that you need to compete with the other Leaders. It's that you're you've given up on yourself. You

Matthias Miller  28:40
better than average, going short of the undiluted version of themselves.

Unknown Speaker  28:54
What did you say of the pure version? I

Matthias Miller  29:12
I just could go, I don't know how much I feel like it's too teachy, but I could be wrong. Nicole

Unknown Speaker  29:18
has helped you draw at the higher part,

Unknown Speaker  29:23
it's, it's,

Unknown Speaker  29:37
we, can we, let's,

Speaker 1  29:43
let's leave the let's leave. We, let's leave. Average to the other 40 proof leaders like you and I.

Matthias Miller  30:03
This could almost be here.

Unknown Speaker  30:11
Yeah,

Speaker 1  30:28
okay, I like going from under perversion of you straight into defining the clarity shot that that just makes sense. Those go together. You better than average. I

Speaker 1  31:18
Um, okay, what if you said after proof leaders, They could be exceptional, but they've accepted being average.

Speaker 1  31:41
Ex. Exceptional comma, but they've accepted being average. I like that. And then I don't know if you need the rest

Unknown Speaker  31:59
that's implied.

Speaker 1  32:10
Let's Hey, hey, oh, no, it's only wine bottles that have corks, right? Yeah, because it would be too bad you could say, like, let's uncork, let's uncork your bottle.

Unknown Speaker  32:25
Sleep.

Matthias Miller  32:36
Hey, it's shot. I gotta specific and I gotta wind down. Go ahead.

Speaker 1  32:48
This feels like, like there's a plan. It's not just,

Unknown Speaker  32:58
you know,

Speaker 1  33:00
Hey, there's this clarity thing. It feels like there's a little bit of a plan, yeah,

Matthias Miller  33:04
and, but it's not. But it does stop short of, hey, I'm trying to coerce you in this, into something

Unknown Speaker  33:22
you might tie it into, would you like to collaborate? And I don't know if you bring it back to the would you like to connect and collaborate?

Matthias Miller  33:34
We're already connected.

Unknown Speaker  33:36
Okay,

Matthias Miller  33:39
let's be let's be clear. Would you be open to scheduling this

Matthias Miller  33:52
call? I think you could also, I

Speaker 1  34:05
Why not just say would you? Would you? Would you like to take it take would you like to have a clarity shot? I

Matthias Miller  34:28
All right, nobody's talking about this stuff like this, by the way, really,

Speaker 1  34:36
I might, I guess I don't know the space you're basically, I

Unknown Speaker  34:45
uh,

Matthias Miller  34:47
this type of language, this, I don't know,

Speaker 1  34:50
okay, it could be wrong. Well, I've never heard of collaborative strategy. Um,

Matthias Miller  34:58
well, even the principles are. Here. Can I, I gotta drop, yeah, take care. Can I, yep, anything else you need, or anything else to add I can? I can channel the phone for just a few minutes, if you want. Okay, sounds good,

Speaker 1  35:10
I guess one at one point. Do you know basic CSS? Yes, okay, maybe sometime I could get your input

Matthias Miller  35:20
more than basic. Okay, it's like,

Speaker 1  35:24
it's just like an off canvas menu. That's the only color like, that's very basic.

Matthias Miller  35:32
Okay, yep, sounds good. I.
