Es, what Is

Unknown Speaker  00:41
that? Hello, yes, blue,

Unknown Speaker  00:52
checking,

Speaker 1  00:57
Okay, I'm coming. I can hear I was able to hear you. Is my audio coming through? Also?

Unknown Speaker  01:06
It helps Sure.

Speaker 1  01:10
I don't know. It's not windy. Is my headsets audio? Anyway, I would be at the office right now, but our car decided to move on to start this morning. The battery just died, but it's a little discouraging after pouring a lot into it recently with lots of different repairs anyway. And my other car, like my car, is in at quality, and it's been about four weeks now that they're working on it, just body shot because Joel backed into it at the office, remember? Anyway, so we're down to one car another one doesn't want to start. So we are figuring out life

Unknown Speaker  01:56
that's yeah.

Speaker 1  02:02
Oh, well, how was the shed Expo and stuff?

Unknown Speaker  02:06
It was good. First year. It's about what can be expected.

Matthias Miller  02:16
Really well, it was standing remotely, and they turn people away. So would have been nice to have done it on day one, but I didn't. So I think. I think I Think

Matthias Miller  07:40
I'm. So that's, that's sorry I didn't catch that's fair. It's about right.

Speaker 2  10:38
Anyway, I think my main question I was working on this yesterday, my main question is, what the review cost process for creation look like on the deposits that aren't deposits yet.

Speaker 2  10:59
Were we planning that those go into the undeposited payments, aiding and that keywords from there, like we think? I

Unknown Speaker  11:32
i Yeah, sorry. I lost you there for a minute, I think,

Matthias Miller  11:42
think something like a deposited payments aging, right, but that's a, that's a, I guess you could still filter based on sales orders,

Speaker 2  11:55
sales order level report. Yes, it is probably not quite right,

Matthias Miller  12:07
not unless you would add a grouping for wholesale payments. I mean, because you could still, I mean, it's still the I A and a link to you To deposit

Speaker 2  12:33
how automatic or manual going to be. I'm

Speaker 2  12:46
like, is it going to be nice just look it's in with on the mouse and balance agent, or is it better just to add a data or in your workbook?

Matthias Miller  12:56
This is probably a question I let me see we had talked about, we had a discussion about this. Let me see if I can pull up my notes on it.

Matthias Miller  13:27
To the instant ID, yeah.
