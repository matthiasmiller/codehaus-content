Matthias Miller  00:43
Hello, hello. Good morning. All right, well, this is us. I got a text from Andrea this morning. She thinks she's got some kind of maybe strep throat or something. So, and then Joel in our rescheduling forgot that he's got two full day conferences today and tomorrow. So yeah. So, Audrey send over the project management reports. So probably just dive in there and just start start with that

Matthias Miller  01:31
Alright, so jumping in on this one here. The account balance reconciliation report I made the changes are live. This is now in Drew's cord

Matthias Miller  01:56
injury it's in your court to confirm the last round of changes.

Speaker 1  02:03
And this is that this is don't have the new button on it on the menu. Or may not button but notation.

Matthias Miller  02:10
I think it should. Yes, though. Hang on. I forget when it disappears.

Speaker 1  02:17
That isn't the account balance diagnostics there on the right, get

Matthias Miller  02:21
Yes. Yeah, that's it. So the so that's an I wonder if I should assign it to her. Okay. Document procedure for closing books and get paid on this mark.

Matthias Miller  02:49
Drew any update on the uncategorized expenses report?

Unknown Speaker  02:54
Um, I'd like to make one. No.

Speaker 1  03:14
Yeah, I think it's kind of another. I'm not sure. Is it part of this? Or is it something else? I mean, the that report in and of itself, is fine. There's some background information work, I think we have to do to make that report say everything. Like it's capable of saying it, we just don't have the information. They're like, pulling in the contact from a sales order into deposit into a payment. Some of that kind of thing.

Unknown Speaker  03:43
You have that on your books? Right?

Speaker 1  03:45
Yeah, I have that on my list of other things. So let's

Matthias Miller  03:50
go for that. And for the purposes of this let's do

Speaker 1  04:09
I mean, in a way, I would say we could just call this one done, almost. But

Matthias Miller  04:12
yep, we'll do a new task for from there. I talked to Dwayne about the moving process. He said basically, this is most likely to cause you know, biggest thing is it's going to cause headaches if somebody doesn't do it right, or we don't handle it correctly. So I think this is the kind of thing where I'm open to you guys's opinion. It's not super urgent, but we should still keep it on the radar and get it done.

Speaker 1  04:41
That's fine with me. I mean, he's, if he's the guy that deals with it. He says he can make his people know how to do it right. And he's the one on the left or not,

Matthias Miller  04:52
but he says you guys will deal with it if his people don't do it, right. So I don't know.

Speaker 1  04:59
Well, I just I got what I need to start reconciling for witness. So So I guess now find out if they've done it right or not.

Matthias Miller  05:08
Sounds good. All right, so this one here. I was wanting to hear let me try something here

Unknown Speaker  05:25
expand your screen a little, we can't read that at all.

Matthias Miller  05:27
Oh, sure. And do that again. So one warning on missing icon

Matthias Miller  05:54
just double check this to be sure, but should have should have worked. Okay, so this one. I think I've got everything nailed down. As of just now. So I think this is now in your call. This is your quarter review. Um,

Speaker 1  06:18
there was one thing on this, I don't know, if you want to talk about it now or not. I was wanting to review the credentials that we put in for we're saying that, that we're duplicating something. Is that this morning? Or is that? Is that a different origin? It's

Matthias Miller  06:39
included in here. So we have one based on let's see if it's within three days and the same account contact and amount. Okay. And then we have another one, where if it's the same vendor plus vendor invoice ID, regardless of anything else, okay.

Speaker 1  07:08
Yes. Now what I want to override the other one, as well like, because the other one can have everything matching with two different vendor IDs, a vendor invoice IDs. And if there's two different vendor invoice IDs, that's about assurance, anything that it's two different invoices to different

Matthias Miller  07:44
so if we have so if we have duplicate vendor invoice IDs, just show that warning and ignore the others. Is that what you're saying?

Speaker 1  07:58
II Yes. Yeah, I think that would work. I mean, like there's some transactions that you're not going to have a vendor ID at all.

Matthias Miller  08:12
Right. Maybe it's pretty low. So do you do you want me we can do this one of two ways. One is only checked by vendor, I mean, always just use the vendor ID if you have a vendor ID and nothing else. And if you don't have a vendor ID then fall back on the other method of matching duplicates.

Unknown Speaker  08:35
Yes, I think that would work.

Matthias Miller  08:37
Is that what you want? Okay.

Unknown Speaker  08:38
So vendor ID for that vendor. Right? Yeah. Yeah, I think that

Matthias Miller  08:48
so we're going to Okay, so if we have a vendor invoice Id check for duplicates by vendor plus vendor invoice ID. Now this this won't catch it if somebody accidentally you know, manually creates a creates a transaction in that case. Otherwise, check for matching on let's see it's dt plus or minus. Account vendor and amount Okay, so then this then becomes.

Unknown Speaker  09:58
Build on Monday.

Matthias Miller  10:08
What's out there anymore? Yeah, pretty much yeah. We need to I was thinking about this system. We think he could

Unknown Speaker  10:28
come in or

Matthias Miller  10:30
install and

Unknown Speaker  10:33
it would probably be. Yeah, I could probably. I think I could probably just come in. Yeah. You know, so it'd be good. If we could schedule a nine o'clock in the morning

Unknown Speaker  11:03
sorry. Multicast? No worries.

Matthias Miller  11:07
Okay, so that will be live in the next. Sorry, waiting on logic. Wow, I got a

Matthias Miller  11:21
Okay, so that'll be ready in the next update, push accounting updates into a county or kind of start, wow, payroll transactions into assist accounting marketing update on this.

Speaker 2  11:31
There are there's some good updates. I consider that done. Okay. I mean, there's some enhancements to make. But yeah.

Matthias Miller  11:50
Okay, update on the track reconciliation. He thinks it's basically done to be usable. And I'm not even sure. Okay, I mean, yeah, I haven't actually used it yet. So

Speaker 1  12:14
what I was running into, and I think you said he's on it, but if you if you'd like that link there. Oh, yeah. Then those ask questions. I fill them all up, left, somehow, whatever it says, Hey, there's still there's still an issue. So

Matthias Miller  12:37
okay, you can do it for a closed period, you can't use it for an open period. But the close three, it is working now.

Speaker 1  12:46
Okay. So if I, like if I just So I've started using this a lot for just seeing what's in the account, because there's a lot more information here than there is just on a regular general ledger. Um, and I have a way of marking, okay, this was one that I saw, you know, marking them off. If I, if I just go in and do that, and don't reconcile it, we'll just leave it open. And at any point, I can come back in and do whatever, is that correct? Yeah,

Matthias Miller  13:28
I think it's, I think it should, I will. Let me just shoot off an email to show. Joe reconciling open statement, periods to the following task is required and prevents Xiling open periods.

Matthias Miller  14:07
Okay. Yeah, I mean, as far as I know, I mean, in this case, probably what you'll have to do is do something funny like,

Speaker 1  14:17
well, I can get a statement end date in. Yeah. But barring even after I had something in all of them, it said, Oh, you need to fill in this as a required prompt. Even

Matthias Miller  14:33
though there were a bunch of pixels that Joe made yesterday. So in the short term, you're gonna have to set the estimate the next statement date, right that you can you can do that. And then we'll have to chase that. So there's, there's more cleanup, and under the hood stuff that he has to do, but I think it's at the point where you can get your hands on it and start playing around with it. Do

Unknown Speaker  14:56
you think there's any Okay, when can I be using this?

Matthias Miller  15:06
Well, okay, so the one question I do have is why old transactions aren't showing up under this old statement date, which I would think it should, but

Unknown Speaker  15:17
I, well, there's nothing in 1979?

Matthias Miller  15:20
Well, I think what they did is they use 1979. Is everything. Like, none of the historical transactions were tied out to a specific statement. And so we're tying, we should be tying all historical transactions out to 1979 transaction. Because we don't know what Steven it actually was.

Speaker 1  15:39
Oh, like all the ones that are previous that are already marked reconcile.

Matthias Miller  15:43
Right. But clearly, something's not working. And also, this is not going with this. This is also not filtering correctly.

Unknown Speaker  15:55
Oh, yeah. That was another thing that I had noticed.

Unknown Speaker  16:00
Let's see. You're ready to do end of month reconcile. So. Yeah. Right. Which

Unknown Speaker  16:09
end of year ends? In the month of December, yeah.

Matthias Miller  16:21
Okay, well, I mean, I think so. I think you should be able to, well, except restarting your starting balance is going to be wrong. As far as I know, you should be able to, yeah, run into issues.

Speaker 1  16:40
I need to clean up. I need to reconcile out December and find out what I have outstanding. That's what I like December still open. Okay. So if I have a wrong beginning balance, that doesn't matter, as long as not more? Like? Will it be reassigning things later? Oh, I guess I could make a reconcile for earlier, you just make another November reconcile or something dated for way back then. And I don't often.

Matthias Miller  17:21
I wonder if I should wait and see if Joe's available later today. Once he gets out of his meeting, and talk with him about how how we should handle historical transactions that have been reconciled?

Matthias Miller  17:39
Okay, because I think we should do that. Otherwise, I'm afraid we're going to end up with transactions that aren't tied out to a reconciliation statement, and then we're going to want to timeout then it's going to shift your starting balance. And I don't know it just sounds like

Speaker 1  17:56
Yeah, yeah. Okay. If, if, if, if it's ready for an update to go on and update this weekend, when does that update happen?

Matthias Miller  18:11
Well, if there are changes that are there any fixes that can be made to make it work? Today, then we can do it tonight. But it'll be Saturday sometime.

Speaker 1  18:23
Well, I guess what I would say whenever it's ready. Let me know when it should be done. They'll probably work on it. I got I got a wedding. Next week and next week, my dad's getting remarried. So Gotcha. Got to be able to get on to it before the end.

Matthias Miller  18:47
Yeah, okay. Well, let's let's get something done before then. Because we I mean, we should be able to do one Friday night even if if necessary. Let me Haley historically reconcile transactions Joel none of the historical transactions are tied. Sorry, my understanding is that we would tie out historically reconciled transactions to the 1979 statement. This did not happen. Is this the plan? Do we need to do anything to make this happen? Mostly I want to avoid any surprises and shifting balances if Drew starts reconciling alright. And I will see

Matthias Miller  19:49
you all right. Yeah, we should we should uh, should Cover that we'll check it that moving. Okay the Ohio in New York District sales are still over certainly

Unknown Speaker  20:09
no change.

Matthias Miller  20:10
No change. I said it's for marketing

Unknown Speaker  20:13
email so now I can blame him

Matthias Miller  20:20
hot potato what? Any update on hidden payments multiple Essos.

Speaker 1  20:27
That's the same thing. I mean, it requires the same thing from March so no, no change.

Matthias Miller  20:35
Automatically recurring invoices. I don't know if you saw this, but

Matthias Miller  20:46
we now have this guy.

Unknown Speaker  20:50
Oh, yeah. Great. Okay. You

Matthias Miller  20:52
can go I guess this is in your court. Yeah. And

Speaker 2  20:57
you also have the status is available. Right. So you need to question for you drew on like the owner pay. Do you have that status afterward? Never even shows up on the

Speaker 1  21:10
Yeah, I haven't said if I need to do something. Then it's inveighed approved. So it will miss the verification report and just come directly to me. But that's approved does does that's on verify that it's official reports when they approve it. Okay, that's what I thought now. Maybe I expect your I like I thought once it's approved, it's not on their list. But they had those prepaid.

Unknown Speaker  21:42
I think they stay on until they're paid but okay, but it's,

Speaker 1  21:48
I need a way to know about it. Something that I pay, but the ones that are automatic just go to pay. Like the one that's just an automatic transfer out of the bank, or Well,

Speaker 2  22:00
I think we should look at that later. And yeah, this is a Josh report. He could update some of those statuses maybe better. Yeah, yeah. Now this is this is this has already brought some clarity to it. You said there was like to rent payments were but dismissible a district manager said hey, you're paying her on that. That random on has changed, so I don't know how he would have bought it. Otherwise. Wait until they reached out. Yeah, wait

Unknown Speaker  22:32
till they tell us. Yeah. Nice.

Matthias Miller  22:35
Good. I like it.

Speaker 1  22:41
So are those Argos default set those ones I already have?

Matthias Miller  22:47
No, they're not did you want them set to something by default? I can very quickly here go assign them all. If you have one that you

Speaker 1  22:58
well set them if you can just set them to the following month one and then I'll go change that there's a couple that aren't and I'll just change those okay

Unknown Speaker  23:18
all right.

Unknown Speaker  23:22
Well, three companies

Speaker 1  23:24
Yeah, the rent payments for the following month there's there's a couple of those change those but yeah, that'll work.

Matthias Miller  23:33
Okay Level One shows repeating one. Good.

Unknown Speaker  23:42
Right now like all of them we just heard from Chet MBT No no, it

Matthias Miller  23:50
was all Oh yeah. Yeah, they're they're all companies just mixed together

Speaker 1  24:02
um Oh, that is that is done. There's one issue with the printout. That's a little bit weird. But

Matthias Miller  24:20
okay, let's do let's do that as a separate

Matthias Miller  24:29
Okay, income statement and general ledger. Result except for testing moving to drew

Unknown Speaker  24:47
the general ledger part. I am not sure.

Matthias Miller  24:56
On that one, whenever that fell through the cracks

Unknown Speaker  25:01
Well, I just I haven't gone in there a lot.

Matthias Miller  25:09
We wanted to share the contact. So we've got that. Yeah, we dropped the class. So that's done. Okay, so is there anything else here?

Unknown Speaker  25:23
I'm trying to think if we should drop the notes or not.

Speaker 2  25:37
Welcome to make so that you can add the notes and not show the notes or not show the notes depending on like, can you use? Is that what you're saying? That there's times when you

Speaker 1  25:49
know, yeah, there's, there's because either certain places and things like if anything goes to Uncategorized expense, which then categorize expense report has the notes. So I leave it the way it is. Let's not go back. Yeah. Because that's that would be the number one use would be Uncategorized expense. So

Matthias Miller  26:16
this would be the printing one. I guess we could probably bring this one back around. Do you have it on your? Oh, yeah. Let's

Speaker 1  26:27
there's an attachment on the email that I just sent you that shows that

Unknown Speaker  26:39
income statement? In fact, there's a few places that should use lines, we're gonna try to modify that. Oh. Like Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  27:01
What do you mean, there's other places that you use ones?

Speaker 1  27:03
Um, if you scroll down just a little bit? Oh, between the different go up between like,

Matthias Miller  27:16
so there's 66. Okay, there is no 64. What?

Speaker 1  27:25
Why is 60 below 62? Sales expenses? Because

Matthias Miller  27:30
we're sorting by name of

Speaker 1  27:36
one normal I didn't even notice that like right here is operating expense that names are sorted by

Matthias Miller  27:44
category name. Not by first ID of within the category.

Unknown Speaker  27:58
category of not by some type.

Matthias Miller  28:03
A administrative marketing Oh, operating s sales. So

Speaker 1  28:10
got it? Okay. Um, that would work except for that, that operating expenses should not go in there.

Unknown Speaker  28:19
What is the operating expense? Is that that we had a category

Speaker 1  28:26
Latson account? No, that's so pink. What is that?

Unknown Speaker  28:32
We have changed that to non operating.

Speaker 1  28:37
Mo 992 92 is non operational? Yeah.

Matthias Miller  28:48
Let's go take a look at the accounting definition. This is under the expense roll is under operating expense. It is a type expense type of type operating

Speaker 1  29:04
shouldn't be non operating. It should be.

Speaker 2  29:10
Alright, but be wrong. If we want to reorganize those categories, like sales, marketing and what administrators we want to do the other way around. Can you set those like sort after? Like, can you say, can you go to say, Listen,

Speaker 1  29:33
I can do that with the accounts but not with the subtypes? Okay.

Matthias Miller  29:40
You could. I will. For the ones that you guys set up. This is a little janky perhaps but you could you could name it 62 marketing expenses, and just prefix it with the account number and as long as it's a two digit Number it would just sort by this, which would, or even if you wanted to, if it's a range, okay, like, so I don't know if there's any here, that's a range. But

Speaker 2  30:10
well, so if we add that number, it's just so it starts correctly, then if we, if we say, let's not see the numbers, those numbers would stay on. Right?

Matthias Miller  30:21
They would Yeah, yeah. Fair. We can, I had thought I would put in a request for accounts to sort based on the first one, it was just too complicated or not, but based on that the categories would sort based on the account numbers within them.

Speaker 2  30:44
I mean, that's, that's how we build our chart of accounts with that intent in mind. I would say it's not urgent, but it's something that would be a nice to have.

Unknown Speaker  30:54
Well, I didn't even see that. Anyway, thanks. Looking at something from looking at angles.

Unknown Speaker  31:05
statement that

Speaker 1  31:09
you know, I was concerned that our numbers are lining up and matching from from the different variations of the of the report. Because last time they were changing, if you did, you know, level one versus level five, it would change and or show accounts, not show accounts. And so that's what I was looking for.

Unknown Speaker  31:28
I think we need to frame this one of these.

Speaker 1  31:34
reason this is framed is not because it's so good. It's just because it is.

Matthias Miller  31:40
Yes, there was a years ago, I don't know if Ellis still has this but years ago, Ellis rewrote our wrote, rewrote, I think he just wrote our graph subsystem. So we have graphing capability. We don't use it much. It's not super powerful, but and he fired it up. And there were lines in the wrong place and weird colors and things that weren't working right. But you saved a copy because this was the first graph. It was horrible, but it was the first one. Yeah, okay. And then this and then in addition to this and here let's do

Matthias Miller  32:37
okay, that's that.

Matthias Miller  32:44
So this is in

Matthias Miller  32:53
through scenarios trying to wrap my head around where this one is at. Okay, so this is still next. This is on the 24th. Are you gonna have this reconciled by next Thursday?

Speaker 1  33:17
Um, probably not. But next Thursday, I can't come in for me. And, and the difference between that Thursday and the following Thursday is going to be minuscule on what I accomplish.

Matthias Miller  33:37
Oh, boy.

Speaker 1  33:40
Well, we're not going to hit too close the books for 23 by the 15th. That we've already who did you talk to about that?

Speaker 2  33:46
Well, it's going to be end of February's is the day before? But that's yeah.

Matthias Miller  33:57
So should we put it on the agenda for the 22nd?

Speaker 1  34:00
Yeah, I think so. I mean, I, I'm hoping to have these reconciled by you know, end of next week, next Thursday, per se. Well, actually, Friday, I'll probably have more working time, but it's kind of what I'm hoping but I don't know if I have time to do anything more than just get them reconciled. Like to really review, you know, what is needed or how it went and all that.

Matthias Miller  34:33
But let's, let's maybe what if we what if we just keep it on the radar for the 15th. And I don't know. I think it might be good just to keep it. Keep it on the radar and we can

Speaker 1  34:51
come up to anything we can at least start making a few notes. So

Matthias Miller  34:54
yeah. Okay, so check search We have here wow, that's embarrassing

Unknown Speaker  35:14
let's see

Matthias Miller  35:20
strict labeling so then we have a new check that should populate the filter by company vs populates that. The same with checks to print, which we should time new record populates the company.

Speaker 1  35:44
Okay? While we're here one thing to make a note on this one is a note field, just down the bottom, just like transactions have got it can, you know, case use cases, they write out a handwritten check and send us a copy of it. So I want to be able to attach that you're creating a transaction be able to you know, notate who did it and that kind of thing.

Matthias Miller  36:13
Do we have something like that we already have. We have something like that and deposits right? Yes.

Unknown Speaker  36:18
Yeah, I think so.

Matthias Miller  36:28
Okay, gotcha your eye okay. So new check button. Are you good? Closing this out? Yep.

Matthias Miller  36:46
All right. Now we're getting to the things

Matthias Miller  36:54
Wait, I said this would be Wait a minute. No, this is not the right one. That's what she was talking about.

Matthias Miller  37:19
Oh, what was this one called?

Unknown Speaker  37:24
Task England invoices or something like that?

Matthias Miller  37:27
Yeah, it was into the recurring. Now I lost myself.

Matthias Miller  37:49
Okay, so this one do not match accounting. I know what the issue is. I think I actually have started fixing it in the past and then got derailed and didn't get it done. 1099 summary reports. Let's see. Let's go find out if I've got anything else. Where's my link to it? 9316.

Speaker 1  38:17
I'd like some discussion on this one. I don't know if you want to come back to it or we're not.

Matthias Miller  38:26
Okay. Yeah, let's Can one of you guys make sure that we come back to it?

Speaker 1  38:31
Yeah, I have it on that email of no email. So we'll be good. Okay,

Matthias Miller  38:37
and then we are smack dab in the categories Expense Report? Yeah, the bank transaction report. We don't really have an action plan on so that we could talk about

Speaker 1  38:56
we don't really have any update on that. Absolutely. And either moving on which funds the bank what we're going to do for that cash out report?

Speaker 2  39:07
Oh, no, we don't. So, one quick question on this Matthias thinking I think long time ago you had created report and dabbled with this. One basic God is can you create a report that shows all trends at all transactions that hit the bank account say use cases I want to see all transactions that that hit the bank account either or hit a specific account but the use case would be hit the bank account either increased or decreased where there was no vendor invoice attached because the thought is all vendor invoices are processed through the entire AP system, so we see them there, this would be for things like when somebody does withdraw or makes a contribution, or

Speaker 1  40:16
those types of, or pick it up on the bank statement and just create a transaction instead Oh,

Speaker 2  40:21
yeah. Like, I think I mean, it wouldn't be would it be fair to say, it's not exactly this make this list of all journal entries? Isn't?

Matthias Miller  40:37
What it's, it gets a little more complicated if somebody writes a check with miscellaneous items. But it's but the check is also for vendor or vendor invoices. Do you want those transactions included? Or do you want to only include it? If it's were checked? That is doesn't have anything to do with any vendor invoices.

Speaker 1  41:06
So if the miscellaneous lines was last items on vendor invoice, do those not hip to verification report?

Speaker 2  41:17
Yes, I think what they do what Matthias is saying, if if you have oh, a good example might be well, I don't know out like, well, I guess. So alpha, alpha building products. So we have five, purchase orders that have invoices to be paid. And then we have another we have another $30 charge that there never was an invoice you just picked it up on? didn't pick that up? No, you wouldn't pick down. Somehow it got to your attention. You said Oh $30 transaction for cost of goods. You add that like, oh, no, just a single transaction.

Matthias Miller  42:08
a made up story is somebody's going to the lumberyard with a check for an order that was delivered, and also picks up a whole bunch of miscellaneous materials and writes a check for the whole thing. Right? completely made up. But the whatever they picked up, I guess you would then go back and create a vendor invoice for that charge most likely. But

Speaker 1  42:36
well, or you just write a journal entry? No, you would have to go back to that. If it was one check for the whole thing. You'd have to go back to that vendor invoices. Add it as miscellaneous? I don't

Matthias Miller  42:49
know. But that was the that was it was separately. It was already invoiced. They're paying off an old invoice and they're also buying something else. I don't know when this happens in practice, but Well, we can find out let's do this too. This is easy. Let's do a report on all. I don't know if we have enough or there's anything actually. Sorry. Let's see. Check where I did not want to do that or this would be?

Speaker 1  43:52
And so you would go, you would add it to

Matthias Miller  44:02
we don't have any scenarios where you would that you've done this yet. So

Speaker 2  44:07
I would suggest we could I mean, if we start out real basic. So you would have some you have a bank something getting your in this case, the bank account. And there's no no vendor invoice. Yeah, there's no vendor invoice behind it. So in the example, the hypothetical example you gave point or a class it would, it wouldn't it would ignore your example because it would say Oh, there's one vendor and was behind

Matthias Miller  44:48
and you would exclude deposits or would you include deposits?

Unknown Speaker  44:53
Any deposit that

Speaker 2  44:57
Well, was it not tied to eight Any deposit that's not okay can we do this basically any deposit that is not recorded as a payment on a sales order

Unknown Speaker  45:15
basically, it doesn't have a sales order

Unknown Speaker  45:18
Yeah. Okay, what if it seems like

Matthias Miller  45:22
a bit about this

Matthias Miller  45:33
is positive it's tied to sales orders and then you have a commission on top of that. Well,

Speaker 1  45:37
you would want those you would want those to show up when

Speaker 2  45:41
Yeah, so can we go to just go to the transaction level on all of these everything this and the expenses say just go to the transaction level. And see if you have a transaction not tied to a vendor invoice or tied to a sales order

Matthias Miller  46:00
let's go pull up the I need a I've been thinking about doing this and I just need to do it I need a report that goes from any record like this and pulls up the transactions for it

Matthias Miller  46:16
because writing these types of reports is getting kind of old counting transaction trans event type equals assist posit and count trans record ID equals and hunting the number down out of the address has also been noxious. Alright, so wait a minute Oh, this one's This one's too new.

Speaker 2  46:57
What this report is saying any expense we haven't seen go across the verification report or any money's coming in that we have not seen on deposit sheet right yeah.

Matthias Miller  47:13
Okay, so if you do this if you do this record, commissions and site work and you do it on a transaction level which you would see is this was voided.

Unknown Speaker  47:33
Really Why?

Matthias Miller  47:43
113 he voided it assists deposit at the county impact

Unknown Speaker  47:53
on 17 Do you

Unknown Speaker  47:57
know I think this is something liver

Matthias Miller  48:01
Commission's revenue was apparent account and should not have any transaction what should Commission's this would be our to premiums for cricket barley? Yep. All right. Well, that was fun. Yeah, how many more are there like that? See who made that?

Unknown Speaker  48:31
Who made that that

Matthias Miller  48:34
first place? Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  48:38
Because it was

Matthias Miller  48:44
what? She she put it in is on the positive? No. Wait.

Speaker 1  48:53
Oh, primary checking. Yeah, give us one of those. So I fixed it incorrectly. Well, at least I was trying to fix it.

Matthias Miller  49:02
Or at least you're trying to fix it. So we should actually validate

Unknown Speaker  49:11
like, Does it count anywhere else? Like when

Matthias Miller  49:15
there no we should validate it. You can't select parent account this is where deposit and checks. Validate against signing two parent accounts. Yeah, that would be good. Good to do. Okay, well that was while we're really going on a wild goose chase this morning. Let's go back to our deposit so see if we can find one that we can use. This one looks like it Nope.

Speaker 1  49:50
There's just not going to be that many that have the slowness.

Speaker 2  49:55
Wow. Don't don't use any of that have empty those are You got to deposit names. Those are the ones I did

Matthias Miller  50:09
it let's do this. This will help. All right, let's try this 178

Unknown Speaker  50:13
Oh, all right there something else we need to fix?

Matthias Miller  50:22
Okay, so here we go. So this is what you're gonna see in the detail. Yeah, undeposited funds for this amount Uncategorized expense for this amount. And so there's not a lot of there's very little information here. okay for them to review.

Speaker 1  50:45
So, there's, there's two, two fixes assigned, or that we need to do here, that would actually make a difference in that. One is that Uncategorized expense, we need to that brought from the transaction over as our into the transaction as a lump sum of all those miscellaneous items.

Matthias Miller  51:08
Right? So we would like to individually. Okay, so let's do that. And then you would have the, it would be. And we so we can do other amount of reference number, you know, and then include the reference number from over here, plus the memo. Right? So it'd be something like references or reference number 123, gift cards? Something like that appropriate?

Speaker 1  51:42
Um, can we just just drop the other amount? Part?

Matthias Miller  51:49
Right, number, like,

Speaker 1  51:50
because if it's not part of the deposit, while the deposit grows, obviously isn't going to change. And if it didn't come out of undeposited funds, then you know, it is other church. So you would take both of those fields, throw them into the notes? What you're Yeah.

Matthias Miller  52:09
Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1  52:13
Yeah, I think that would work. I mean, that reference, that check is just, it's coming in. It's not our check number. So that should be fine. Yeah, I think that should be fine. Um, wouldn't be nice if we could. Did I? Is there a contact name on that? If you go back to the deposit, yeah, the customer name and all that customer name over?

Matthias Miller  52:43
Kiss customer name is not. Okay. This is opens a whole other can of worms, but Oh, no, no. Can we just put that in the notes? Is that fine?

Unknown Speaker  52:53
That would work for for this that?

Matthias Miller  52:57
I mean, the C k for 204, merchant gift cards. Okay. There, we're not tying these out to contact records.

Speaker 1  53:12
Right? Because it usually this is just odd stuff that somebody you know, it's, there's no sales order. So. So it's not like we need to pay off a sales order.

Matthias Miller  53:23
Yep. No, go ahead.

Speaker 1  53:30
Well, the other part was, can we pull contact information over from the sales order? And what was the use case?

Speaker 2  53:43
If so, if we look at our income statement, we show revenue of 120,000 for a month. And then we go to the general ledger and say, show us these 100? What? How do we get down and running out? And then it's not showing us contact names on those? Can we bring

Matthias Miller  54:02
those across? Is it the bill to name or the ship to name? The bill to build to name? So yes, we would do a very similar thing. So

Speaker 2  54:15
how hard would it be to mock up a report of that, like go to the general ledger and mock up a record? What I want to see is what does it show? What can we show on, say wholesale orders like How helpful is it? You know, is it going to just show a whole bunch of JetDirect can we

Matthias Miller  54:32
sure let's try this. So this would be let's go to All right. We're going to do a report based on the assist, deposit. Assist deposit as sales, assist deposit, payments pipe list. Okay, so this is gonna be repeat list item and we're gonna do a repeating list like list actually, let's do this. Okay advanced and we are going to do tab through a soy the

Matthias Miller  55:31
advanced release to do a string that numeric we're gonna do that for now. Okay, so then we're going to do columns column column detail and this is going to be repeat

Matthias Miller  55:56
to repeat please repeat this item with at least one column that's visible

Matthias Miller  56:13
with 20 Okay, what are you not liking about me

Unknown Speaker  56:25
let's do this

Matthias Miller  56:35
so ad

Matthias Miller  56:44
is really not liking Music

Matthias Miller  56:59
Okay, fine

Matthias Miller  57:06
okay, so the things we might be able to show would be billing name. So Id the date, so payment date method

Speaker 2  57:24
what about the well want to take a look at a wholesale sales order then and see what information is there if there's your

Matthias Miller  57:45
Okay, so let's do this first and then this is going to be Yeah. Wouldn't let me do it so don't. Okay, so tab list item repeat list item one. Oops, two, three, or I don't know how many I need but six and seven. Okay, so what are we okay, so this is A.

Matthias Miller  58:27
B, so Id, billing name.

Matthias Miller  58:35
payment date, payment method, amount.

Matthias Miller  58:46
And let's reverse sort by deposit ID, so we can see newer ones. Okay. So here is here's this as an example. And let's sorry, let me get one more. Let's group this by it's actually a group by deposit ID in reverse. So this is this is what some of the information that we could have. So

Speaker 1  59:19
that first section was all on one deposit. Is that right?

Matthias Miller  59:24
Yes. Which, I mean, in fact, why don't we actually move this around a little bit and let's do let's make it look like it would show up on the deposit. So we would have the payment. So we have the the amount and then we would have the and then a potential memo

Matthias Miller  59:53
I mean, we can play around with this, but we're this would be this would be the The amount and then or this is not memo, but this is notes. I mean, we could we could do something like, this is probably not how you want it but

Matthias Miller  1:00:18
assemble notes kind of like this

Speaker 1  1:00:23
remount the wheels on the deposit bank, then the amount to the right. Like the amount of the payment is to the right of

Matthias Miller  1:00:37
whatever limits might be more like that. Oh

Unknown Speaker  1:00:44
okay, so what we're showing here is is, so we're saying this is what was deposited? Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:06
Probably one of the deposit date on there.

Speaker 2  1:01:18
So what's what's the use case for this one specifically, this is for that, on the basically way to show income for a week's time, or money deposited. So this is this, this is exploiting credit card payments, right? This is all looking at anything that would have gotten transacted to our bank account.

Matthias Miller  1:01:44
Correct. Although we could have a, I mean, this is there's a lot of work that needs to happen to get this into the report. But we could do an equivalent report for credit card payments as well.

Speaker 2  1:01:58
By selecting any if you have multiple credit card accounts you could do, there'll be one for each, like this references one GL account, right? Or this tip,

Matthias Miller  1:02:11
it will right now all I'm doing is looking at currently checks are sorry, deposits are lumping together into a single line, which means that we would have to start splitting things apart into multiple lines for deposits. The other thing is, if we want to view credit card payments, then we need to split apart stripe payouts into separate line items when we push it into accounting, which we can do. So some of this is pretty hand wavy in this point as far as what you want to see, I think. So what we would end up doing then is in your transactions, and we would just show all the transaction detail. Sorry, let me break down. What we need to do. The end game is we want to run a report on bank and credit card accounts and look at the flow of what is flowing through. And and so in order to correctly support that, then stripe payouts and deposits need to push each sales order into an individual line item on the transaction, which is fine, but we need to we need to specify them what format Do you want those notes to be in when they get pushed into accounting? I don't know that makes sense or not.

Speaker 1  1:03:37
So it would still on the Bank Ledger it would still show up as a single number for the deposit. It would just be the other side would be broken out for

Matthias Miller  1:03:52
so when you run a report on your income account, instead of seeing a lump sum, you would see one you would see for 1684 6240 11 263 broken down with the notes but but there would be a single lump sum total amount for the

Unknown Speaker  1:04:14
Now does that you can pull that across through accounts receivable because the transactions coming from accounts receivable

Matthias Miller  1:04:27
Okay. Well, you push that onto the transaction record a sound problem.

Speaker 1  1:04:32
All right. Well, actually the deposits coming from undeposited funds is where it's coming from.

Matthias Miller  1:04:38
Correct but it's ultimately

Speaker 2  1:04:40
Yeah, but we're jumping that but by showing the the name in the notes here. Great. Got Oh, I think what, okay, for just looking at this report, this is this is looking at income. I don't know that we have a date range but I think for what the use case we're wanting for this, I think the the deposit ID, I feel like we'd get rid of that the only thing we should show would be the

Speaker 2  1:05:20
I think we should show this, knowing what builders are looking for, I think what would be most helpful would be in the left column would be the date that we say we deposited like 131, all these that I'm seeing the date in the first column, and then the, okay, is that the next string all in one column, the end 231? In the shed strike, oh, that's one column. Got it? And then do that next, you know, like you have it there. And then if we could switch? Well, no, no, that's correct. Basically, what you have there, I don't know that the what is the date the 125? And like, shake? That's

Matthias Miller  1:05:58
the payment date?

Speaker 2  1:06:01
The date the payment? I mean, yeah, we'll leave that there. And then I don't think that grouping it for deposit is it's not helpful for so if we get rid of the like to subset grouping.

Matthias Miller  1:06:16
Okay, so here's what I'd like to do is, okay, so we can remove the subset grouping, but we could still then.

Speaker 2  1:06:27
Yeah. Okay, I guess we could, what you just had there was, yeah, we're that we're just

Matthias Miller  1:06:36
just like that. Okay, so this is just a small window into what it would end up being we need to clean it up a bit to make it better, but 2402, a one sample deposit retort? I will be

Speaker 1  1:06:56
for all the stock? Well, what I don't care about whether it's from undeposited funds or not, I need to know who it

Unknown Speaker  1:07:01
was. And they were that was kind of the response to our

Unknown Speaker  1:07:10
good we do the exact same thing on all expenses

Unknown Speaker  1:07:18
that are from accounts payable.

Speaker 2  1:07:22
Yeah. It's it's saying here. Like, what this? Okay, let me see if I'm seeing this correct wellness report. I think what this report is saying is, here is what we've recorded in assists, that will be deposited into our bank account, like on 131, or 125. We don't know when they're going to necessarily when the bank is going to show it. But this is we follow our process. This is what we book as this is what you'll use to reconcile it. Well, you'll reconcile with the lump sum, but this isn't

Speaker 1  1:08:02
right. But if they want to look at what was the money coming in this week, where did it come from? That's what this film is. All right. For my purposes, it's going to say it came from it came from undeposited funds.

Speaker 2  1:08:19
Exactly. If I could just go one step further on this if we could. What, what if we would drop? I think we should actually put this is a question, could we drop the invoice number and just grew by like, all those SDS shet dealer services, could we group if they have the same name, and they're on the same record as deposited on the same date? Just show that one slide instead of one of the long song? Yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:09:06
Now we really threw a curveball.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:15
How do we have a different payment data? Like?

Matthias Miller  1:09:18
Well, let's let's, if we take this off, I mean, okay, if you're okay, taking the sales order ID off, then yes, we can just group by notes.

Speaker 2  1:09:29
Perfect. Yeah, that would be grouped by notes. And

Matthias Miller  1:09:33
so let's get my sales order ready.

Speaker 2  1:09:39
This goes back to a report that they were used to having out of QuickBooks which was had had some holes in it, but it was we kind of feel that

Speaker 1  1:09:50
we're trying to create a cash basis report,

Matthias Miller  1:09:54
right, in an accrual system. Accrual says Okay, so now Oh yeah no this didn't work. Okay, I think we can Okay then let's do at least for this for the sake of this assist date sorts string let's see reverse or date sorts string assist deposit date plus whatever my notes thing are which is why you don't write reports like this because they're not maintaining not sustainable and not reversing work because that part's reversed

Matthias Miller  1:10:41
Okay, so then the main thing that would have to change then I guess we could do this now

Speaker 2  1:10:46
can we maybe that's what you're working on can we total like all those SDS only listed out ones and total those

Matthias Miller  1:10:54
Yeah. Let me

Matthias Miller  1:11:08
marking this up is going to be a little okay. So now we want the label would still be assist deposit date date strain this would be

Matthias Miller  1:11:35
this would be a value is we can make a pipe was going to target to be the same this can be a some satellite tag and we should have commas and decimals please. Something like this.

Speaker 1  1:11:55
Yeah. Like defense director right below your thing is just separated because there's different whatever that number is in there.

Matthias Miller  1:12:11
Different number correct. I don't know why but I mean, different invoice I suppose.

Speaker 1  1:12:21
And then there's always it's going to be a little fluky things like that one that don't have much and so everybody's gonna wonder what that was.

Matthias Miller  1:12:29
Yeah, I mean, I mean, this one, fortunately, they're gonna know what this was. It's just weird. It wasn't recorded like that. Unless we want to do something like, if there is no, here, let's see if we can find. Find out what that one actually was.

Matthias Miller  1:12:52
I mean, there is no name, no name on it. It's a wholesale order.

Speaker 1  1:13:04
Oh, is that something that we're going to need? Then they'll say, hey, like, is that a? Is that a catch? or issues that should be marked? Or? Or is that a typical situation that there just are a bunch with no names? And that's fine. But

Unknown Speaker  1:13:21
what why does it not have any

Matthias Miller  1:13:24
as dean's office?

Speaker 1  1:13:27
Like, I'm just wondering, could this be a catch where it's like, oh, there's some information missing? We need this is like this is shits direct.

Speaker 2  1:13:39
Could we in these cases just referenced? No, we can't reference the dealer but

Speaker 2  1:13:53
I don't know. Many of it. I have a feeling that most all of these are our legacy sales orders, which means they were sold to sheds direct, I believe.

Matthias Miller  1:14:02
So we could say in this here. I can find it. If so, is legacy. We just hard coded as SDI and otherwise we share the billing name and so now Okay, let's grouping I mean hopefully that's right. Um now we still have some

Speaker 2  1:14:36
that 161 69 That's that wire payment you did. To take it outdoors not

Speaker 1  1:14:45
no, that shouldn't even be on here. No, no that

Unknown Speaker  1:14:51
what is it one thing to do one thing, but what is it

Matthias Miller  1:15:02
Come on. Don't be so mysterious. Okay. Legacy sales order SDI wholesale.

Speaker 2  1:15:13
So it's saying SDI right? Yeah. Okay, so it'll still show blank. If it's not a legacy. Yeah, got it?

Matthias Miller  1:15:24
Well, I mean, basically what we're saying is, if it's legacy, we always just show it as SDI,

Speaker 2  1:15:28
which I think is correct. I mean, Josh could verify that, but I think that is correct. So

Matthias Miller  1:15:32
but then, but what about I mean, there's also these were?

Matthias Miller  1:15:49
Were they they're not legacy. The retails are these retails sales to SDI.

Speaker 2  1:16:03
Yeah, this is. But But okay, there, you've got the bill. You're, you're using the bill to name on that one. Right. Yeah. Which is correct.

Matthias Miller  1:16:12
Okay. I thought there was where was the? Okay, but then here's this one sheds direct. Let's see what this one is this 1204 ad? Which is a wholesale non legacy. sale to ships direct.

Speaker 2  1:16:37
Oh, that's just some miscellaneous parts. So that's, that's correct. Or what is it? Is that one showing sets, right? Like in the

Matthias Miller  1:16:47
bill to the report would show to us ships direct with with that number in it.

Speaker 2  1:16:53
I think that that gives us I mean, that looks correct, the only change I'd probably make would be to go change that criteria to ships direct instead of SDI just so it matches with the others. But

Matthias Miller  1:17:07
let's go.

Matthias Miller  1:17:15
We're looking to do,

Speaker 2  1:17:16
I think to make it more more user, so we're going to be looking at this use on a block of a week or so would be the group. If we would now sort by first make the first sort by the notes and then a second sort by the date it would

Unknown Speaker  1:17:32
like group by the date.

Speaker 2  1:17:37
Now we we are already grouping by the date but but group by the the notes. Just I think just sorting, just sorting by the notes column first, and then by the date would give us like all the sheds right? compiled together because otherwise you're going through this and you're saying, Oh, that's right department here. Or here.

Matthias Miller  1:18:01
Something like wondering I just do. Well, I mean, yeah, it is it is something like this. Except just for date range.

Speaker 1  1:18:12
So we're getting stuff from last August. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

Matthias Miller  1:18:23
grand totals. Okay, well, this looks deceptively close. And it's there's a whole bunch of stuff that we need to do to make it actually work.

Speaker 2  1:18:42
Now, can we do something like like this with similar with expenses? And would those all come over from accounts payable? Like even the prepaid? While if it's no those

Speaker 1  1:18:54
would not, but it's specifically the the accounts payable was the one that they had issue with? That they didn't want to know where that was payable to?

Matthias Miller  1:19:07
I mean, yeah, we could I mean, this is effectively what we can generate. Then on the flip side, once we push the miscellaneous details across on checks, then we'll have that

Speaker 2  1:19:27
I think it might be worth is, if you could shoot us a copy of this report or this file, just to maybe do a quick review, just to make sure that it's

Unknown Speaker  1:19:41
like for last week and yeah, for last

Speaker 2  1:19:43
week, or, actually, yeah, last week for each company or

Matthias Miller  1:19:54
we didn't even cover what you had to do.

Unknown Speaker  1:19:57
Well, I think we did actually most

Unknown Speaker  1:19:58
Not sure how we got to this

Matthias Miller  1:20:07
could we

Matthias Miller  1:20:13
keep it simple and

Unknown Speaker  1:20:17
there's a couple of new requests we don't

Matthias Miller  1:20:22
send you this yeah

Unknown Speaker  1:20:28
that bold print at the bottom

Matthias Miller  1:20:36
so this is not how it's going to end up looking I guess how important is it to here no I can do this total suppress on the outer one there we go

Speaker 2  1:20:53
oh, he is suppressed. I'm getting really picky here. But can you show the totals only on the Amount column? If not, no big deal. I mean, the final report would have that right.

Matthias Miller  1:21:08
We can make the final report let's see is there any other really good way to a good way to I mean, we can do

Unknown Speaker  1:21:30
this is

Matthias Miller  1:21:40
total Tigers expression

Matthias Miller  1:22:02
Ah, perfect. You know where there's a will there's a way I would definitely, let's kill off other extra blank columns. I would definitely not say this is a It looks nice on the on the on the outs on the on the outside. I would not want to maintain this report. There's a lot of hand wavy stuff going on. Alright, so you guys want to confirm that this is what they want on the deposit side?

Speaker 2  1:22:35
Well, yeah, the deposit and the expense side. But what you're saying is you could effectively do the same thing on the expense side. There just be a lot of blanks right now with for situations for transactions only that are not tied to a vendors invoice, right?

Matthias Miller  1:22:53
Or? Yes. Unless you guys go back and fill them in. I guess my vote would be what if we push this? What if I do the change to start pushing this stuff across into accounting? And then once we've got and get a draft report together, and then come back for round two of finessing and figuring out what we need to fix.

Speaker 2  1:23:31
Sounds good. But you're saying still get some feedback on this and just see if there's any. Okay, good.

Matthias Miller  1:23:43
Good. What is priority on that one? Oh,

Speaker 2  1:23:55
I'd say we have something are we doing are we doing? I'd say we have something made ideally by end of next week. But what are we looking at?

Matthias Miller  1:24:12
I'm trying to think what else we have when we look at it tonight against Summary Report. Let's well what if we did this?

Matthias Miller  1:24:28
What if we would? Do you guys want to take a look at what's lunchtime for you guys? I

Speaker 2  1:24:36
mean, we're good if it's good for you. I'm good to keep to keep going. I need to send a quick email to Leanne about something but okay,

Matthias Miller  1:24:43
well, what if we, what are we gonna take a quick break and let's go through. Let's go through all this stuff. And then reprioritize plan of attack. Once we have a full picture of everything that we want to have done? Yeah, Well okay if we could we could break for a few minutes it's enough that email and we can circle back and keep going.

Unknown Speaker  1:29:15
yeah

Unknown Speaker  1:29:22
what was

Unknown Speaker  1:29:35
namaste

Unknown Speaker  1:29:51
Oh I do

Unknown Speaker  1:30:18
What's the trouble or product somebody yeah

Unknown Speaker  1:30:49
let's see

Unknown Speaker  1:31:05
order Stratego marks we have the key on airparks you're one

Unknown Speaker  1:31:25
word

Unknown Speaker  1:31:35
damnit Good luck job yep okay all right see I'm not the tag

Speaker 2  1:31:59
true so we're back it took a little longer than we expected because we summarize in our bathroom door locked itself so

Matthias Miller  1:32:15
it's in the gears

Unknown Speaker  1:32:23
okay I see you sent that

Unknown Speaker  1:32:26
report

Unknown Speaker  1:32:29
the neat one you just created

Matthias Miller  1:32:32
hang on I actually attested to throne you know it's coming your way right now. Good drew should be

Unknown Speaker  1:32:58
there anything you and I could work on util enter is who should be involved in Oh on that put together budget now okay we're going to go

Unknown Speaker  1:33:18
okay

Matthias Miller  1:33:21
alright so reporting for 1099 contractors

Unknown Speaker  1:33:39
the

Matthias Miller  1:33:42
me just pull this and then I meant summary report now this was something okay where was the there was another 1099 change that we have

Matthias Miller  1:34:06
where it's nope

Matthias Miller  1:34:16
Summary Report okay must have been Summary Report alright so

Matthias Miller  1:34:29
monthly production contractor reports in an annual training an AC and 20 Amis lease reporting sort interval by vendor. Okay, so

Speaker 1  1:34:49
you, I don't know should these be two different things or are we shooting to create something that works for everything or not? The verse The first part there. I think if I just take, there's gonna be certain subcontractor GL accounts, which are the ones that I need. And I just grouped by vendor, you know, basically get a total by vendor in those GL accounts and that's all I need. So because it's this, this particular thing that this is for I do not need, like so arrow services, you know, as a 1099 vendor, but we're not involved in production, we're not something that that we're concerned about whether or not insurance is covering us, so I don't need this in this report. So it's about this report is about Purdue producing what the subcontractors do that should be under their own insurance. And so therefore the builder is not responsible for them. That's what this is for. But that's in the production so I think if we just have a report where I can pull run get totals by vendor for certain GL for the transactions in that GL account. I think that's all work for this first one. Now, the second part that would go you know, all 1099 vendors mapping the different kinds of tenant nines like the miscellaneous is like rent payments and then NEC is going to be like the non non wages whatever it's called just the regular payments don't think it's called non like non wage reimbursements or something like that

Matthias Miller  1:37:02
are not reimbursed employee compensation Yes, yes.

Unknown Speaker  1:37:09
There you go.

Speaker 1  1:37:20
Like should we on the GL accounts where it says is a tenant and service account should we just have two different buttons there? That'd be the simplest facts

Matthias Miller  1:37:33
well what if what if we change to make it some minutes what if we change it to be a 1099 type

Unknown Speaker  1:37:52
yeah

Speaker 1  1:38:00
I think that would fix that and then we just have two different you could pull a report based on any see or pulling a brace or based on miscellaneous

Matthias Miller  1:38:19
and then this is where this thing would actually be proper company proper date range group by vendor

Matthias Miller  1:38:37
and then the columns would be better

Unknown Speaker  1:38:52
in fact, just a summary would be fine. Like just a total now if you can do that

Matthias Miller  1:39:03
you want total of for the vendor? Would you want to combine debit and credit? Yeah, so if it's a alias down

Unknown Speaker  1:39:15
it would come back off

Matthias Miller  1:39:23
and as in as an increase, decrease, either we should say you can only flag this is only available for expense accounts.

Speaker 1  1:39:42
There's going to be asset accounts expense or asset accounts. Yeah. Which they'll function was saying now.

Matthias Miller  1:39:50
I wonder if we could we could simplify it if I mean equity it would never be equity in any company or situation it would never be income. Um in any company or situation, even liabilities it would never like it only makes sense we're only allow for assets and expense account types and then this would be a total which would be sum of all debits minus sum of all credits, credits or decreases in both cases, right? Yeah. Prompt for and then 1099 Tight subset all transactions in accounts for the date range where the account matches the type

Speaker 1  1:40:58
some more columns have had like the the vendor identification number like the EIN or whatever, I forget what that field is called. And then also their address

Matthias Miller  1:41:13
Do you want that as a display address? Like two lines? Or do you want it split out into different columns address city state,

Speaker 1  1:41:22
um, this way like yeah, under the address? Yeah. Which we wouldn't have to we wouldn't have to group by vendor then if we're doing that because essentially only has to only have one vote. Right

Matthias Miller  1:41:47
let's go into vendor tax ID Yep. That's what we're calling it

Unknown Speaker  1:41:56
right

Speaker 1  1:42:04
can you make so that you can hit a link to see like, so I have a question about the vendors total. I'm not sure where it would go to just the GL account or something

Matthias Miller  1:42:30
so we need to do report based on the vendor and date range. Well, we could actually do a actually like this. What if we added a sub pane now the word of this filter filter based I've included transactions that would work

Unknown Speaker  1:42:55
yeah, let me that would work great.

Matthias Miller  1:43:00
With this handle the contractor situation. This what would this report handle the contractor situation? Um,

Speaker 1  1:43:12
yes, I think so. Now. They're there, there's a nuance here, is there some way to show like so let's say the vendor for some reason did not get marked as a 1099 vendor. Can I maybe it's a different report, but list figure out what is in these accounts that is not going to show up on this list on this report.

Matthias Miller  1:43:52
And this, this raises an interesting question about what happens when you have a 1099 vendor that you code for non 1099 out of a non 1099 account and what happens to a non to 99 vendor that you do pay out of this account. And where do you want to catch that because this one's based on okay is is this one this is all 1099 vendors who also and their totals based on unmatching 1099 accounts right

Unknown Speaker  1:44:47
um

Speaker 1  1:44:58
yeah, I think that's Yeah, there's there's both of those both of those nuances there Could you could you create something in the prompt thing that I'm not sure which way we're based here but let's say okay, I want to show 1099 vendors in this report and I just want to show the report I want to show everybody on this report like or show non to 99 Min there you'd be based per account in the based on the account you'd show the 1099 vendors and nowhere else you'd show the mountain

Matthias Miller  1:45:53
and then we could group by

Unknown Speaker  1:46:11
and then

Unknown Speaker  1:46:23
right

Speaker 1  1:46:29
well, no What if you would have an option there for for any account? So you'd select Yes, it's a 1099 vendor, but I want any account right? That should catch all those situations

Matthias Miller  1:46:51
when you just go through and just look at the different

Matthias Miller  1:47:03
now it does not let you say so this lets you say I want to look at everyone who's not attended any nine vendor and was paid out of a tenant United account does not let you say who are the 1099 vendors who are paid out of a not 1099 account?

Unknown Speaker  1:47:21
Yeah

Speaker 1  1:47:25
yeah, because you say yes pretend nine vendors and you say blank for tonight account type.

Matthias Miller  1:47:34
So this one when you specify blame what you really mean is

Unknown Speaker  1:47:37
got it Can you specify just all GL accounts

Unknown Speaker  1:47:51
because that's what I would do.

Matthias Miller  1:47:55
What if we did this 1099 accounts? Yes slash no slash blank equals all and then a in any nine account type required if 10 any nine accounts equals yes visible and required.

Unknown Speaker  1:48:15
Oh, okay.

Matthias Miller  1:48:19
So you say do you do I want to do an interview with the yes vendors the no vendors are all of them do want to show the yes accounts the no accounts are all of them and if I choose the yes accounts that I need to further specify whether I want miscellaneous or any see Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:48:36
that would work

Speaker 1  1:48:46
yeah, I think that's that's good to go on that. Did you work on the warning? We talked about I believe we did a warning regarding 1099 vendors that shows up when I pay it go to pay a check well before actually pay but it shows up on this this is another one of the warnings for payment. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:49:13
let me find it. Let's see where was it? vendor invoices needing payment, I did something and take a look at the logic that I used. So it was wait a minute, I thought I had that missing service account. Okay. If if the vendor has a tax ID no morning. Find all financial accounts from the accounting impact. And if it is, if there are any that are attending any nine service accounts, then we say the vendor tax ID is expected when using the following tending United service accounts for the list of the service account.

Speaker 1  1:50:04
Okay. Yeah, I think like, so there's a lot of these accounts that could have somebody needing a 1099. And lots of people not needing it. So I think what we're going to be doing is ignoring this warning, more times than we actually do something about it. But given that, most of our vendors are not going to be marked for 10 nines at this point, I think we still need it. Now, is there any other way? This is what I was trying to think about today? Is there any other way that we can further reduce this and look up some some other criteria? Beyond or just, there's no number and it's in this account to decide whether this one should need it or not?

Matthias Miller  1:51:11
Well, I mean, one thing that we could do is change the attending name from a checkbox to a yes and and no, and so and then blank is just I have no idea and, and so you would have to go clean up your vendors and indicate if there are any vendors that you know, you don't need a 1099 for then you would flag that and we wouldn't worn worn that going forward. And if it's a little unknown,

Speaker 1  1:51:44
then it would be blank. Yes, that would work. Because there's, you know, there's there's some well, okay, for example, building and property improvements. Okay, that's, that's a classic, like, there's lots of stuff that's not going to be if I go to the hardware store and buy a doorknob put on the door to improve my building. I did not want to send the 1099 for that. But if I get Joe to come out and put the doorknob on, you know, Joe should be given a 1099 but if we could mark the hardware store as no this is not a 1099 vendor it would keep that from showing up. I think that would work

Matthias Miller  1:52:30
Okay, so let's try this

Speaker 1  1:52:38
that would be that prompt needs changed anyway I guess I know that's why yeah

Matthias Miller  1:52:48
okay so

Matthias Miller  1:52:55
okay, so then we would change

Matthias Miller  1:53:17
so then

Matthias Miller  1:53:35
and then the disk guy

Unknown Speaker  1:53:58
I agree

Matthias Miller  1:54:03
so here Oh, is that right? So if you would go in and you would set this as a not a 1099 then we would stop showing this warning.

Speaker 1  1:54:22
To start with I would still get a lot but I could I could weed them out as you go. Exactly. Right. Don't worry, it will be me dealing with this anyway. It's not like he explained to me what they have to do. So. Yeah. The only part of this that is really required ASAP would be that that contractor or the subcontractor part.

Matthias Miller  1:54:56
Case and so that one would be a report How's it different than the

Matthias Miller  1:55:11
is it anywhere close to this?

Speaker 1  1:55:15
Um, it's been so good

Speaker 1  1:55:26
it would it could be like that, except so put like, pick one of the subjects subcontractor accounts right? Or maybe just hit all of them

Matthias Miller  1:55:43
including sub sub sorry here looks including the subcontract we just

Speaker 1  1:55:50
oh actually do not include the cogs the 50s So just the first one in the last two because otherwise it will duplicate So yeah, this would work I would just need I would just need instead of Well, I would need to totals for the vendors.

Matthias Miller  1:56:19
Right. You need to group by group by vendors is totally fine.

Unknown Speaker  1:56:22
Yeah, yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:56:25
All right, well, let's do this think if we've got any other kind of report that gets anywhere close to that so we don't let you control grouping on these

Speaker 1  1:56:44
coming in a way it's just a general ledger report. That would be grouping as well. But be able to throw multiple Ledger's onto the same record right.

Matthias Miller  1:57:03
Okay, let me take a look at this category Uncategorized expense accounts

Matthias Miller  1:57:20
I think we're better off just grabbing a few stuff from here and company ID it might actually be best just innately Luise Virginia Lafayette we're

Speaker 1  1:57:41
about to chop down some of the shame solution.me The

Matthias Miller  1:57:45
multistable x Oh maybe I should just

Matthias Miller  1:57:56
getting sober was brought up down to the shore so then we need the date filter yet we ask start date and end date both both they

Matthias Miller  1:58:41
HD minute we have your date filter

Matthias Miller  1:59:04
got a thing

Matthias Miller  1:59:16
all right. We need to filter this by top oh it's some

Unknown Speaker  1:59:37
not sure why it was but why?

Unknown Speaker  1:59:52
Arms

Unknown Speaker  2:00:00
Some ended up

Matthias Miller  2:00:15
being solved. Right, let's see if this one. So we got contracts. This one, this one, this one. And we'll do this from genuine one or January first. Okay to 1231 Sorry, 131. Now, let's put the transaction date on there. So you can see that and let's go to these this ID for brevity.

Unknown Speaker  2:00:56
So the

Matthias Miller  2:01:00
other respiratory, do you want to see the UNC the account?

Speaker 1  2:01:08
Yeah, yeah. Why don't we just, it would help with, you know, just verification that yeah, these are in the right place and stuff.

Matthias Miller  2:01:22
Like notes?

Speaker 1  2:01:30
Yeah, yeah, do because there's some that are probably going to be paid by handwritten check occasionally. And so we'll want that in there. Yeah, I think that'll work.

Matthias Miller  2:01:43
Okay, I'll save it. And then I'll make it a standard. So this would be 20 2402. This is a transactions by contact report. We're,

Speaker 1  2:02:02
madam, madam. I guess I'm going to think of it as like a subcontractor report or something. But it wouldn't be transactions by contact? Because then you could you could pull that on any account. Really? So

Matthias Miller  2:02:24
that works good. Okay, well, I will get that on the menu and let me just let me just shoot your link and then we got you need it? If you need it before then. Here this is like Hello. So true. No.

Matthias Miller  2:03:06
Key

Unknown Speaker  2:03:09
How much time do you have?

Matthias Miller  2:03:11
I have got let me take a look at where I'm at. Three hours. Oh, I got. So if we could wrap it up in the next two and a half hours? That would be good.

Speaker 1  2:03:24
More than me that on the email, there's still two items that we didn't cover. They shouldn't actually be that much to cover really? New Requests and number one on the quick transaction entry page.

Matthias Miller  2:03:43
Yes. Got it. That seems pretty straightforward. seconds. Guys. Name and then just didn't account for that before debit credit, or do you want it after?

Speaker 1  2:04:01
Um yeah, it's probably after or on it like, so what does the description there? Is that the transaction description? Like on top of the page? So I mean, yeah, keep that there. I'm just about thinking this could replace that. Because this will be notes per line item instead of Yeah. Yeah, we are. Well, it's there. Leave it there. Well, no. Let's replace it. Because this is we're describing Emma based on the lines rather than based on properties the whole transaction and why Oh yeah, I would say so.

Matthias Miller  2:05:08
Okay, so take the scription out and move the online notes to the very end. Yeah, I think so.

Speaker 1  2:05:17
Now, this reference, is this reference the same thing as the payment ID that's like it wouldn't show up in the US. The reference at the top of a pay reference at the top of a transaction shows up as a check number. Oh, so that's what this would do. Right? Yep. Yeah. Okay, so we're good there

Unknown Speaker  2:05:52
we go.

Speaker 1  2:05:59
Yeah, okay. And then number four. In transactions here, the line item details? Can we move, we put a reference in there. Like the same thing we do for content. If we have a line item contacted just says multiple references, and then a great reference here up in the reference on top it would just say multiple references? Or is that really bring mud in the soup?

Matthias Miller  2:06:36
We can take a look at it. It's not gonna happen.

Speaker 1  2:06:37
Yeah, that's fine tomorrow, okay. That it's a convenience thing. What it is, is, when we bring in payroll, we have, you know, 10 line items, three of them are specific checks out to somebody. So it'd be nice if we could throw a reference in there for that, you know, that that check but it

Matthias Miller  2:07:10
and, I mean, I think this is a deceptively simple thing, but has barely significant implications, because we need to think through how this works with recording and other stuff. So if it's a simple thing, just to throw it in the notes, that's going to be

Speaker 1  2:07:30
right and that's what I'm doing currently. And it works for when I do the wreck site works to find that but it won't sort it with the rest of the checks. Because you know, if I sorted by reference or payment ID maybe you could just put payment ID in here. I don't know if that would be different.

Matthias Miller  2:07:51
Well, we'll give it but in reckon the reconcile won't show okay, then the reconcile would show multiple for you so that you would know that I see what are the heavier like when you pull up the reconcile you would see it and then you would see one draw where there's multiple reference reference numbers probably only shows a lump sum

Speaker 1  2:08:29
immediate Okay, well don't worry about it. And we'll just keep putting it in the notes. There's not going to be that many in a month's time and I mean, it's gonna be a dozen or more maybe but something like that okay.

Matthias Miller  2:08:48
I mean, it does so top two things you want are the splitting the transactions out and getting that report for the builders on cashflow that's number one.

Speaker 1  2:09:06
Yeah, I would say so. Is there a number two splitting the transactions out you're saying on payment deposits

Matthias Miller  2:09:14
sorry yeah deposits and checks splitting them out into multiple line items so that we can give get the builder reports out?

Speaker 1  2:09:20
Yeah, um, then that that Notes column on the brigands repaid with Bribie be number two. Okay.

Matthias Miller  2:09:31
Sounds good. I will write

Speaker 1  2:09:40
that in the reconcile the reconcile function is number one, right? Yes, that's probably Josh's or Joel scores or whoever.

Matthias Miller  2:09:50
Okay, let me let me make an reconcile. I will call up I saw some emails from him on that while we were talking. I will follow up with that. Number one reconcile number two builders. Cash reports and then number three the line notes Okay sounds good

Unknown Speaker  2:10:05
yeah thank you

Matthias Miller  2:10:06
yep thanks for me
