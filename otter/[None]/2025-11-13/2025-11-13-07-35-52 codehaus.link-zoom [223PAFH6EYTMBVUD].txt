Unknown Speaker  05:28
Good morning. Matthias,

Matthias Miller  05:29
Hey, good morning.

Unknown Speaker  05:32
I'm finally in welcome.

Matthias Miller  05:35
I thought about making coffee, but it required opening a new bag of coffee beans and, oh, that would be terribly hard. You're suffering in silence.

Unknown Speaker  05:47
Did you hear our stories from last night? You want to hear some stories? Yeah, always stories.

Speaker 1  05:58
Okay, first of all, we have my classmates, Serge and Bree from Ontario, are here. Classmates from FB are here for the evening, or here yesterday evening and then today and leaving tomorrow morning. That's really fun. So we had Nick and two of the other FB friends over for supper. The least happy part was getting a message that Michelle's dad was had fallen down and was dizzy and stuff. And then the next message, he's on the way to hospital with multiple broken ribs. So thankfully, and that's all it was, then he had fallen getting out of the skid loader, and somehow, broken ribs. And anyway, so that was the least happy part that came. A few minutes after we had bright white lights flashing in our backyard, we went and checked, and there was a cop running through, and we saw there was someone had ditched their minivan in our backyard and run. And the cop came tearing through. I opened the door, and he, like, yelled at me, like, Do you see anyone? I said, No, and then he ignored me and just kept running and was yelling something to dispatch about suspect running north towards east sick anyway. So we had cops literally running around our house and yard and the neighborhood for the next 30 minutes. Finally they gave up. They never found the guy came back and talked to us a bit. I said, No, we didn't see anyone. We're just eating supper. And then they went and we're searching the car. We had four cop cars there, like all in the alley right behind our house. Someone had had driven their van down or down the alley between Fifth and Sixth, and ours was the first house that didn't have a fence, and so they just veered in and ran anyway, and and like the bumper was falling off the van, there was a tire on top of the van, on top of I don't know why or how, there's still a remnant of the bumper sitting in our backyard this morning. The tow truck guy eventually came, and he just hopped in and drove off with it, so I think the keys were still in it, apparently, like someone was in a hurry to leave. And then they went. The cops were inspected, and they came, I was chatting with them a little bit. He said, Yeah, we found drugs in the car, so it's gonna take a bit to process, and then we'll get the tow truck kind of take it off anyway. Our exciting evening.

Matthias Miller  08:32
How late were the cops? I mean, how late until it all cleared out? Then,

Speaker 1  08:39
probably 830 ish it was. They were there about an hour and a half, probably, yeah, around seven and it wasn't

Matthias Miller  08:47
terribly late, at least you didn't have, like, blinking police lights outside for 2am or something.

Speaker 1  08:54
Now, thankfully, not that it was that was one of the more high octane neighborhood encounters we've had this is sort of like, like you see foot chases on in movies and stuff, but I've rarely seen it in My backyard. Yeah? Well,

Matthias Miller  09:16
yeah, that that tops everything. I think, what was it gonna Oh, close they've ever got. I mean, we've, we've had, we've had shelter in place because of suspects in our area. Oh, yeah,

Speaker 1  09:42
from from the that Max security prison close to y'all,

Matthias Miller  09:46
not from the max or maybe not, not from the not from the Fed, but from it's actually more likely that people escape from minimum security. But we've had, well, we've had some suspects from the. Some there was an incident in the last year at Arms suspect that they were hunting our neighborhood for they never tell you exactly. They'll tell you something about what they look like and tell you to stay inside, but it won't tell you exactly what the they won't tell you the reason. Yeah, makes sense. But yeah. Anyway, there's always these smart guys, big, big, get away. The worst one was, I forget who it was. I think it was a friend of a friend. But there's a story of a of somebody who came back to their house and there's a half eaten peanut butter and jelly sandwich in their house

Unknown Speaker  10:37
after they go back.

Matthias Miller  10:39
Yeah, that's That's not cool, that that almost, I mean, that's, that's very invasive, okay, well, you take the cake on the exciting events. I

Unknown Speaker  10:57
should send you a few pictures.

Matthias Miller  11:01
Just can't imagine. It's crazy.

Speaker 1  11:06
Yeah, I have rarely had that level of adrenaline in one evening. It was, yeah, it was quite a lot. Anyway, the first I sent, the first picture is just, you can see the abandoned vehicle on the left, and police lights on or vehicle on the right, police lights on the left, and then the cops searching it, and then one of the four cop cars.

Matthias Miller  11:31
Oh, gracious, a random guy. You really got to wonder what the story is on that thing. Wow.

Matthias Miller  11:49
That's crazy.

Unknown Speaker  11:56
Okay, should I drive? Yes?

Matthias Miller  12:01
Well, I mean, let's you can drive for now we need to figure out what we we said here, sorry, 115 let

Matthias Miller  12:22
me get the twins calendar event.

Matthias Miller  12:38
Okay, so, I mean, we need to figure out how we want to handle handle rounding. Yeah, I just don't think we're going to get okay argue with me. I know you're going to hate me for this. I don't think we're going to get accurate sales tax numbers if we don't do a basically a running total, if we don't use running totals to calculate the tax owed,

Unknown Speaker  13:09
hey, what does that look like

Matthias Miller  13:10
like? Okay, you, let's say you. Let's just do simple sales tax. You have a sales order for 1000 bucks and or 5000 5000 1000, $5,000 and then, and so we run sales tax on it, and then they come back and they have a change order on it, and they want to throw a ramp on there. Oh, we can do that. So we throw a ramp on there, and now it's an extra 500 bucks. So instead of saying it's tax on five 5000 plus tax on 500

Unknown Speaker  13:39
be five, yeah, and you subtract what it was,

Matthias Miller  13:42
what, what you've already remitted? Yeah, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  13:47
the existing stuff.

Matthias Miller  13:50
Well, that's exactly, that's exactly the issue. I mean, that's the, that's the challenge.

Unknown Speaker  13:58
5000 correction transactions.

Matthias Miller  14:04
Well, it's not that, I doubt that it's that many. But the real thing is, it's one thing. If we could okay, what would be the implications of blindly waving our hands and saying,

Matthias Miller  14:30
Well, running a report and telling, could we build a report and say Drew? We are doing a one time shift of all the numbers by this much going forward. It's going to tell you that you pay different values than what you did,

Speaker 1  14:55
but you're saying we leave existing rows as they are. You.

Matthias Miller  15:01
Or we change the logic so that the tax amount changes on historical rows, which means that it won't match historical filings. That's not good. Probably,

Speaker 1  15:12
I don't think so. I mean, probably at that point you want to it'd be better to just add a cash field that we If it's there, we look at that otherwise, right?

Matthias Miller  15:27
I think we probably have to, just about have to do that. So could we build a wouldn't it make sense for the first place to start to build a sales tax history report that uses this new method of calculating tax and finds, finds out how finds the differences.

Unknown Speaker  15:50
That sounds sane, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  16:07
so do you repeat on it?

Matthias Miller  16:10
Yeah, repeat on it, and then

Unknown Speaker  16:39
total tax amount so I think I'm gonna make Oh, can we just admire this IFR folder?

Matthias Miller  16:50
Yes, we can do some more work

Unknown Speaker  16:53
yet, but down to 62 is just pretty great.

Unknown Speaker  17:02
Do anyway, where did that? Did someone restore that? Guy? I don't

Speaker 1  17:10
know where this i don't i thought i'd archived all 2024, except for December. But anyway, look so row. I That's

Matthias Miller  17:22
it, new sales tax or something.

Speaker 1  17:25
Well, I was gonna make an old one. Okay, sure, dude. Just

Matthias Miller  17:33
right. Look at you. I

Unknown Speaker  17:44
How long is that? Oh, come on.

Unknown Speaker  17:54
Old sauce, history. Sauce.

Matthias Miller  18:05
A two decimals, sure, why not Bob, we live. Oh, it's a non taxable. Yeah, it's a non taxable.

Speaker 1  18:21
Cool, that's it, a frame two story with a wholesale discount, $13,000 wholesale discount. That's a lot.

Matthias Miller  18:31
Yeah, this is why people like selling post frame, pull barn, etc. Because, anyway, it's interesting watching the market evolve. Why? Why? What? Why

Unknown Speaker  18:47
do you discount it like, literally 40 is that 40%

Matthias Miller  18:51
I mean, it's somebody else is paying for marketing for it's 39.39% I mean, that's, that's it. That is conventional wholesale you know, margin, that's what it was on. I mean, like at this, at the store, everything, okay, that was the standard. Some things like cards, I think were like 50% but okay,

Unknown Speaker  19:15
sounds like a lot to me. But anyway, it's more glaring when it's ending up?

Matthias Miller  19:24
Yeah, exactly. Well, that's and that also gives you insight, who you should ask for donations, and how, like, if you ever, you ever could find a, you have an opportunity, you're doing a fundraiser, and get a you can get a pole barn company, or somebody like that, if they actually or should, should company like to contribute material? It's a great case where they pay they have a lower fixed cost or lower actual costs, out of pocket, costs with a higher, higher contribution.

Unknown Speaker  19:55
Gotcha, Yeah, makes sense?

Matthias Miller  19:59
Okay? Okay, and then the new one is where it gets really fun.

Unknown Speaker  20:12
I'm gonna do this thing. There you go.

Matthias Miller  20:17
So we need to store. We need to store the

Speaker 1  20:23
Row Type, wait. How can you do a running sum, though? Because the rate changes potentially on rows.

Matthias Miller  20:31
Well, you do a running, running, running, some matching on jurisdictions and rates on tight jurisdiction and rates, right? It's the same logic as when we when we calculate liabilities.

Unknown Speaker  20:46
Oh, I think I'm dragging so we need to get

Matthias Miller  20:56
go in the Catalog Editor and just copy out the fields i

Matthias Miller  21:18
Yeah, which fields are you wanting? Road the city and those guys, and then also the road type? Yeah, I

Matthias Miller  22:07
guess I should? I should have copied both you

Matthias Miller  22:18
can use all selection to edit both of them at the same time?

Speaker 1  22:21
Well, no, it doesn't. I've tried that before. It doesn't work for me on this I don't know why, because I love it when it works yoga,

Unknown Speaker  22:38
yeah, I mean, I would if I could. I ahead,

Matthias Miller  22:47
awesome, okay, and then we start with a sum RG,

Matthias Miller  23:03
well, we need a we want historical subtotal in each of these. Yeah, yeah. So it's a summer g of

Unknown Speaker  23:21
isn't it? I mean minus,

Matthias Miller  23:26
minus the signs And within,

Unknown Speaker  23:29
yeah, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  23:45
Medium and

Matthias Miller  24:03
Okay, so then and we also need to check whether it's earlier than this one. So I don't know if we could. We need to use, is it too lazy? Current our genome.

Unknown Speaker  24:23
Do we have row IDs,

Matthias Miller  24:26
like, give it or the RO IDs guarantee? Oh, Darren, you're right. You shouldn't be Well, no, no, hang on, we have an RG sort. Look at the RG, sort on 870, mm, period, end date, effective date, and the row type, but, but this is not de duplicated, and so I would just say I think our genome is our genome. Yeah, yeah. I.

Matthias Miller  25:16
Less than, yeah, less than

Speaker 1  25:25
we only care about the taxable sector this guy,

Matthias Miller  25:42
okay, let's, let's create, let's refactor that into a subtotal expression, or, yeah, a subtotal expression that takes a reference parameter so that we can run the same thing for the Tax Amount. So

Unknown Speaker  26:21
such An amazing exactly.

Unknown Speaker  26:39
I I'm smoking. It's always worse than

Matthias Miller  26:44
someone's watching. It is always worse.

Matthias Miller  26:55
Okay, so we have Yep,

Matthias Miller  27:06
yeah, so then we want to do a sum.

Unknown Speaker  27:14
Oh, sure. Or Should this? I

Matthias Miller  27:18
mean, I don't know if it matters, like you would just, I would just do a sum of this and the current value, less a sum of the historical Well, times, tax, I

Matthias Miller  27:47
have, we have The same as the local macro, whatever that

Speaker 1  27:58
is, I right? But it would be, how did we? Times?

Speaker 1  28:27
Okay, so that gives you the tax, total tax and now, yep,

Matthias Miller  28:40
now, yeah, well, we total tax.

Matthias Miller  28:58
Then, what do you do of the so Sales Tax history, whatever the tax amount is, I

Matthias Miller  29:26
yep,

Unknown Speaker  29:40
this should be fun.

Matthias Miller  29:51
Let's go repeat our G steps.

Matthias Miller  30:04
Hmm, whoa, something's not happy. Ashes, well, maybe we should

Matthias Miller  30:21
film so high if I've seen 75

Speaker 1  30:23
this is use tax adjustment. Wait,

Speaker 1  30:37
as we're Can you taxable? Subtotal adjustment. Are

Matthias Miller  30:42
you sure you don't need to replace na of

Unknown Speaker  30:46
we need to do the we have a macro

Matthias Miller  30:48
taxable sales. Taxable sales do

Matthias Miller  31:07
it's in the if you just go into the

Unknown Speaker  31:10
Yeah, yeah, that guy,

Matthias Miller  31:13
yeah, that'll make a difference.

Unknown Speaker  31:20
And then wait here,

Matthias Miller  31:26
right look at, hey,

Speaker 1  31:35
that's not very much. I will say that is not very much, and they're all one cent differences.

Matthias Miller  31:41
Well, that, I mean, that's about what we would. Is there any way you can show the sorry, that's a dumb question. Do you want to add the so accounting balance just on the column

Unknown Speaker  31:59
as of the effective date?

Matthias Miller  32:02
Yeah, today? Well, no, today.

Matthias Miller  32:13
Okay, why? I'm curious why these, why zero out? Yeah, that's, that's what I'm really I would expect everything, I mean the other day, expect why the zeros?

Speaker 1  32:32
Because the rest I'll go as expected, like the signs make sense? This guy, just these two just, don't I?

Unknown Speaker  32:56
Act so

Matthias Miller  33:11
house, sorry I missed the story of what this is on the on the sales order.

Speaker 1  33:21
This guy is the one that at zero, but we think that it should be off

Matthias Miller  33:28
by one, right? But what's the story on the sales order itself? Like, what's I mean? Is it so we paid by check the total amount go in the history,

Unknown Speaker  33:39
we changed jurisdiction, stuff. So we change rates, then we adjusted the taxable subtotal too. Look at that, right so

Matthias Miller  34:03
okay, but if we

Speaker 1  34:09
stakes for final structures,

Matthias Miller  34:22
yeah. 1405 16. That's hilarious. Okay, so pull the sales tax history.

Speaker 1  34:31
Gotta tell Jay to stop giving away steaks Exactly. Oh man. Okay, 1405, yeah, it's that amount, and our 6.75 to that's coming out, out a cent off,

Matthias Miller  34:50
747, 6.24 plus 1405. 16 is 8881, 40. Which? Is what we expect the tax jar, the combined rate is 6.758 1.4 times point oh, 61756675,

Matthias Miller  35:21
so, 599, 49 which is exactly what we'd expect. The

Matthias Miller  35:35
504 65 plus 9485 599, 50 so if you go back to wait, it's because put add effective date to the column to the report. You

Speaker 1  36:10
I'm mad at myself for having the different prefixes. These are both.

Matthias Miller  36:16
These are from 2024 so we're not respecting sales tax when it comes to accounting balance calculations, which is why they're tying out. So in the

Unknown Speaker  36:34
No,

Unknown Speaker  36:40
no, what's the start date? I don't think so. I think it's, yeah, 10, 124, okay, never mind

Speaker 1  36:48
on or after, like the macro we're using returns true. Well, let's see what were the other conditions. I

Speaker 1  37:03
Oh, this is why, because we're as of or equal greater than today. When we calculate today, we use so tags,

Unknown Speaker  37:14
so we can't, if we do today, we're not going to look at the history, RG, because the history hasn't been long.

Matthias Miller  37:25
But should we that? That doesn't make sense to me.

Matthias Miller  37:38
If you do Na, we should look at everything other ways. We should treat stay as a literal today, and we've got other accommodations if we don't have rows,

Speaker 1  37:49
I mean, it just means I make a correction, like, if they change amounts or something, then it's going To be wildly off until sales tax runs again, potentially. That's why, because sales tax only runs every evening,

Matthias Miller  38:09
that's why. That's why. Makes sense. Okay, all right, so that I mean that explains that. Explain does it? Does that explain that? That explains the difference? No, I

Speaker 1  38:23
so we're saying we're still getting the same with a as updated yesterday, though, no, that's today. I thought we're on the 14 track. 12. Whoa.

Matthias Miller  38:43
Um, wait a minute.

Unknown Speaker  38:49
Now we're way off.

Matthias Miller  38:54
How is balance off by a penny if we're running today,

Unknown Speaker  39:00
because it's looking at the tax amount,

Matthias Miller  39:03
but it's not and, and, but, but the other one doesn't have the corresponding check for history.

Matthias Miller  39:14
You go to so accounting balance as of go into so payments and write offs. Arguably, should we somehow have similar logic where, if it's today or future,

Speaker 1  39:35
ignore sales tax in here we are sorry, ignore bad debt, the sales tax history.

Speaker 1  39:48
That's so confusing, doesn't it make more sense to tell them that it's not going to tie out until the next day? Yeah.

Speaker 1  40:04
The Accounting total, or is that going to be too much noise, then you just always run I guess they probably do run the AR report. They don't run it for today anyway. Do they do

Matthias Miller  40:31
Yeah, faults for the day does

Unknown Speaker  40:40
put it maybe that's another question. I mean, it does kind of make sense for default today, it Does

Matthias Miller  40:59
Okay, but why the wild discrepancies otherwise? Why do

Unknown Speaker  41:50
so I don't have to type it in each time. Otherwise, we're gonna get

Matthias Miller  41:55
you just add a column for today and today, today minus one. But anyway,

Speaker 1  42:01
but it's this way, yeah, I like this. Okay, um,

Matthias Miller  42:33
three. So the biggest difference John Denman is the guy, Denmark, whatever he is, it's the guy I'm most interested in.

Unknown Speaker  42:52
It's John Denman.

Matthias Miller  42:58
So 60, do you want to pop over the sales order separate windows, we can see them both at the same time. I at the same time, yeah. So we have 6216 66 as the total.

Speaker 1  43:18
This is looking awfully similar to bad debt,

Matthias Miller  43:28
to 5815, why is the account okay? Because it has includes tax, 6216, so that looks like the I. Of Wait, this says the old account. So accounting balance bug this. This doesn't have your fixes for the So, accounting balance bug that, yeah, this doesn't have

Speaker 1  43:56
your fixes. Yeah, of course. I Okay, then what do we need to figure out?

Matthias Miller  44:10
Well, I mean, I think we should just,

Speaker 1  44:13
do we need to table trying to figure out rounding until we the next update so we don't have confusion like this, or do we need to pursue it now?

Matthias Miller  44:25
Well, let's, I mean, can't we just plug in the the updated, updated macro, I know. I'm sorry. I

Speaker 1  44:53
does this one has to change this one didn't this one say the same? No, this is. Got to change. This is the guy that changed. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  45:53
so now

Matthias Miller  45:59
we still have,

Unknown Speaker  46:04
but now we lost the crazy, crazy discrepancies.

Matthias Miller  46:08
Yeah, now, every now. Okay, can you add a column for the difference between old tax amount and new tax amount?

Matthias Miller  46:21
Yeah, which one do you want first? I'm too lazy to think it through. It's gonna Well, whatever it should be, it should either match or be identical to the balance. Yeah. Like that. Good job. I'm proud of you,

Speaker 1  46:40
it should either match or be identical to the balance. Sorry,

Matthias Miller  46:44
I meant match would be opposite. Wow. I was working in the Cash Flow Report. Couldn't figure out when my numbers were going wrong, going wrong, and then discovered that I was multiplying it by the I have a, you know, times one, times one, times negative one multiplier, multiplying it by the by the multiplier choice. So it's really sorting things off.

Unknown Speaker  47:06
That would throw things off.

Matthias Miller  47:09
Okay, so this, this, let's look at the shed time one, because that's the odd. I think I'm now comfortable with these guys. Whoa, what?

Unknown Speaker  47:40
Ice override. Ride.

Unknown Speaker  48:00
Why do we have sales tax history on this guy, And why

Matthias Miller  48:05
didn't it zero out yet? Ah, that's baffling.

Matthias Miller  48:42
Okay, but isn't it because, isn't it? Isn't this discrepancy just because we haven't is? What did this happen today?

Speaker 1  48:52
No, it's been not a month. But are you sure it's not

Matthias Miller  49:00
some kind of weird exclusion for tax exempt? Yeah, for tax exempt? We're not updating it. Should we just go

Unknown Speaker  49:25
sometimes history in

Matthias Miller  49:49
it has an RG row, so it should be on. I mean, it'll be on. Can we, can we preview, or can we run this subset on there? Ah.

Speaker 1  50:00
Does it not have a Where did that guy go? Does it not have a

Unknown Speaker  50:13
now, has that what was your?

Matthias Miller  50:19
Can we either, can you copy the subset out and make sure it's included in the subset? Okay, can you run the report and see what it generates?

Unknown Speaker  50:33
Wait, can I run it for blank? Yeah, I can.

Matthias Miller  50:42
Okay. What was this guy? He's not on here. He's not in here. Okay, so go into the log repeating list, then,

Matthias Miller  50:56
tax info. I

Matthias Miller  51:11
go to look RLI for current row for RG, row, row two, lane two, and then into here. Oh, no, this is just, this is just

Unknown Speaker  51:26
the, just for the rows that we have.

Matthias Miller  51:30
Okay, where do we? Where do we? Do we have a subset then to hide zero adjustment rows? Yes. Oh,

Matthias Miller  51:44
well, like, you know, hardcore the subset did, just for, just to just this so ID and then take this out and see what, or see what gives.

Speaker 1  52:06
Okay, so the rates are zero, that way. Oh, well, and the adjustments are zero. Everything's zero. Well, I mean, but that isn't Wait no status is seven,

Matthias Miller  52:26
but it's tax exempt. So that's why we're not getting a new row. Okay, go into the sales tax history, but there's a rate in here seven. Like, that's not right.

Speaker 1  52:40
Shouldn't there be a use tax adjustment to zero it out?

Matthias Miller  52:44
Yeah, there should be.

Matthias Miller  52:53
Okay. Go back into go into the it's not this one. Loc, Calc, okay. Hang on tax rate.

Speaker 1  53:01
Look, we think it should be a use tax adjustment, right? Use tax adjustment? Yes.

Matthias Miller  53:44
Yeah, okay, so, I mean, let's break it down into parts and pieces. I'm going to guess it's miss, it's incorrectly. What's What's the So, use tax material, subtotal. I They cleared it. They didn't clear the use tax.

Speaker 1  54:12
Ego. So where is the it's when we enable Use tax and we so it's tax exempt and enable Use tax, that's the problem, right? Yeah, they're paying sales

Matthias Miller  54:29
tax on a zero use tax on a $0 invoice.

Unknown Speaker  54:38
Okay? But do we have a

Matthias Miller  54:53
it might be good to add validation at some point that you stack doesn't exceed invoice total or something. You're saying this guy, yeah, like, why would you ever, yeah, exactly.

Speaker 1  55:13
Well, could it, depending on discounts, given

Matthias Miller  55:20
that's your it's your hard material cost. I mean, if you want to lose money on it,

Speaker 1  55:28
donation, well, I guess that would still be there. Donation is a bad debt. Write off. Yeah,

Speaker 1  55:42
there's 19 of them, most of them from 2025,

Matthias Miller  55:54
oh, my goodness, I am starting to believe that accounting has almost an infinite number of trails and loose ends.

Unknown Speaker  56:07
I think so.

Unknown Speaker  56:18
This is going to go to them to clean up

Unknown Speaker  56:26
X exam, and we're back going the Wrong direction on IFR, but hey, I nuked 150 yesterday. I think I can add one today, right? Yeah.

Matthias Miller  56:46
Do you want to try adjusting it to see if, if there's any that show up when you Oh, no, that's what you did. Perfect. Actually, it's, it should be the episode. Subtotal, yeah.

Speaker 1  57:06
It's still the same number. Yeah, expected, yeah,

Matthias Miller  57:12
I love it, man, good work.

Speaker 1  57:17
So weird. We found 19 sales orders that are marked tax exempt. They'll have this tax.

Matthias Miller  57:32
Can you do it at a sum on the use tax material, subtotal and a sum on the on the tax owed column? Can we find out how much we just saved? Save them.

Unknown Speaker  57:43
Yeah, that so, no, yeah,

Matthias Miller  57:49
some RG, some RG. So still, tax history with this tax amount. I

Matthias Miller  58:03
What is that total tax of some kind? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  58:13
I need to go rename a bunch of those macros. They all have the same prefix. It's so bad.

Matthias Miller  58:19
John needs to go rename a bunch of macros. That's true.

Speaker 1  58:23
Seth needs to make a list of macros for Sean to rename exactly,

Matthias Miller  58:29
and then add CSM columns. All right. Well, I think we paid for ourselves if, assuming they wouldn't have found this themselves, and

Speaker 1  58:43
I don't know what they it, they'll do anything with these old guys.

Matthias Miller  58:48
Or maybe they will. They can still it would still just run automatically as a credit. Okay. Cool. I love it.

Unknown Speaker  59:00
We, found 7400

Matthias Miller  59:03
well, with a $0 subtotal, of course, there's tax exempt,

Speaker 1  59:09
yeah, we found $7,400 you can ask the government back back for

Matthias Miller  59:19
is that fair? Well, I mean, if it's an I think so well, unless they need to pay use tax, do they need to pay use tax for internal usage? That's what I don't know. Oh, okay, well, I'll just say, I would just ask, is the use tax on on these $0 invoices intentional? And maybe this is a way for them to report use tax. I. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:00:08
if so, that seems a little odd, but maybe I don't know.

Speaker 1  1:00:18
Okay, okay, so we traced that guy down.

Matthias Miller  1:00:23
Okay, so I suspect that's actually what, yeah, what's going on there. So, so the the new tax amount, there's a slight adjustment, so that's what use tax is the reason for that discrepancy, which means I'm looking at this and I'm happy with how this calculates.

Speaker 1  1:00:43
Use tax. You're saying it's the reason for the only one that did doesn't come out, as we expect, with a new calculation?

Matthias Miller  1:00:49
Well, no, the only one with a $0 balance, right? Because, of course, right? Yeah, yeah. So, I guess the next step is implementation. Basically what we need to do is freeze a freeze a sales tax, have a frozen sales tax value, and then, and then take this MAC and with a migration that stomps us in for everything historically, and then update the macro, it'll use this logic. Yeah, or well, or do we want to actually start freezing it all the time? I

Unknown Speaker  1:02:05
maybe, I mean,

Unknown Speaker  1:02:13
it's not gonna hurt us or reason all the time, is it?

Matthias Miller  1:02:16
Oh, it's not. In some ways, it's almost cleaner to do that. I hmm, because

Speaker 1  1:02:23
it doesn't care if this is what we said, If this is what we filed, then you kind of want to just freeze what we filed. Yeah, you do. I think that makes sense, which means we just change that to field and migrate the value, yep.

Matthias Miller  1:02:43
Change it to field, migrate the value, and then update the report, the x 30s to set the field with the new macro, yeah, which technically, I mean, it's just a calc adjustment. Actually, it's just, it's just that helper report here. Change this guy on the new row. This is actually simpler to implement.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:11
Okay, all right, I mean, go ahead. Are you willing to drive?

Matthias Miller  1:03:27
Do you want to I need to go grab water. Okay, first step is, first step is, let's change this to a field and freeze. Do?

Unknown Speaker  1:03:49
Say, back, I.

Speaker 1  1:05:00
I'm just gonna start listing the ones that bug me.

Matthias Miller  1:05:06
You should export it to Excel, then you can put it into a table with an old and new name.

Speaker 1  1:05:12
Most of them are fine. It's just a few that are I think

Matthias Miller  1:05:19
it's the it's the top three.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:23
Oh, this guy's fine. And then there was also

Matthias Miller  1:05:35
the, oh, the macros. This guy, I don't know how many the macros are.

Speaker 1  1:05:57
Yeah, all those guys. I'll throw them in Excel later. For now, I'll just dump them in here.

Matthias Miller  1:06:00
No, it's fine. I mean, it's easy to tell them what to do, just to do. Just change them to, like, literally, it's just renamed these from a SFL, tax history, prefix, student, ss, sales tax. Hist,

Unknown Speaker  1:06:11
well and remove row, I think,

Matthias Miller  1:06:13
well, what

Unknown Speaker  1:06:17
do you think fields? Most of the fields don't, it's just,

Speaker 1  1:06:28
can't just be SF, sales tax, History ID, his ID, row ID could be row ID, but then the next one I don't, I think can just be tight, and the one after that can just be effective date. Yeah, yeah, okay, so this guy, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:06:52
read row. That's enough for now. Oh, but I was wanting

Unknown Speaker  1:07:46
and then we're going to

Speaker 1  1:07:53
make, is it fair to we can, I think we can keep the macro. I'm just gonna, I'm

Matthias Miller  1:08:05
but you're not gonna that's not it's not really something you want

Unknown Speaker  1:08:11
people eat, just That's fair. So essentially, probably, hey, we didn't realize that.

Matthias Miller  1:09:14
Mean, if you want everything to just work, you could that's, that's,

Unknown Speaker  1:09:21
you're going to tell me to rename

Matthias Miller  1:09:22
it? No, you don't have to. We should find instances of the total and start using, you know, yeah,

Speaker 1  1:09:35
knowing things I don't have tax history in my RG or in my system. Oh, pain.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:53
There's all sorts of that's why

Matthias Miller  1:09:58
I was wondering if we just. Keep the same name and let's Sean rename it when he gets to it, I'm

Matthias Miller  1:10:23
fuel Test System, the test system or something. Then, yes,

Speaker 1  1:10:40
um, I wish I could I keep I've asked numerous times for a copy, and you copies the SP, but it's almost at the wrong time too. That takes a long time to download.

Matthias Miller  1:10:55
It looks like in me an inv. If you give me an inv file link, I can upload one for you. Like programming. So what it is, I could never, the problem is I could never remember what? Yeah, I'll,

Unknown Speaker  1:11:12
I'll find my folder.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:19
Ah,

Unknown Speaker  1:11:28
here are you? Do you have?

Matthias Miller  1:11:32
I'm going to just drop it in honey, encrypted, and then just please delete it down. Download it right away to delete it. Yeah, I thought I had a recent 111, seven.

Speaker 1  1:11:51
I mean, that's pretty recent, better than mine. Mine's probably year and a half, two years old, year and a half. I bet it was when I came back from SB.

Matthias Miller  1:12:05
I did forget for sure, get this with me test system, didn't I?

Matthias Miller  1:12:15
We triple

Unknown Speaker  1:12:21
check to make sure stuff is scrubbed or

Matthias Miller  1:12:24
yeah, what does what scrubbing does happen? I don't know.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:29
I trust socials and stuff are scrubbed. I

Matthias Miller  1:13:12
they don't do anything with that. Let me see what scrubbing we do.

Matthias Miller  1:13:30
Be on the affordable point test. I

Matthias Miller  1:13:49
Yeah, by whatever measure, I don't think socials and stuff are removed, but

Unknown Speaker  1:14:01
smiled to terrifying.

Matthias Miller  1:14:12
It's two and a quarter gig zipped slightly better than client scoop. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:44
Oh, shoot, that was done. I.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:06
Right So?

Speaker 1  1:15:59
Of the well, I can shoot that to Sean sometime today, and we'll get it done. Get done cool.

Matthias Miller  1:16:46
There's the refresh and there it is.

Unknown Speaker  1:16:57
But doesn't be fast.

Matthias Miller  1:16:59
Wait, what world sounds wrong.

Matthias Miller  1:17:11
It's not done. I mean, it says zero bytes.

Speaker 1  1:17:16
It's working on it. Oh, wow. One gigabytes.

Matthias Miller  1:17:21
I uploaded it in a minute.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:25
I don't know, maybe two.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:36
I mean, I

Speaker 1  1:17:44
inv file. I don't think it's my fault the download is to look like megabytes per second. That's not terrible. Okay, well, all right, well,

Unknown Speaker  1:18:13
so Jonathan is dissing my handwriting over there.

Matthias Miller  1:18:22
I admit I had a hard time reading your whiteboard, but

Speaker 1  1:18:24
it's fair. I i To be fair. I do that up for myself, not for anyone else. I'll just say that that's fair. Um,

Unknown Speaker  1:18:45
wow, the whole office is examining my handwriting.

Speaker 1  1:19:01
Jonathan said he will not count. Cast the first stone for my handwriting, waiting for somebody else to do it. Huh? What? No, I think he's acknowledging his own guilt in said category. Fair enough.

Speaker 1  1:19:46
Okay, I mean, I'm fairly sure this, in this migration, I'm going to just commit Yes.

Speaker 1  1:20:04
Whoa, okay, let's not commit all my contract changes. Yeah, there's a huge slew of them. I didn't have them quite done last night, so I left them for this morning. I

Speaker 1  1:20:34
A so we have that now. What do we need to do

Matthias Miller  1:20:37
now? We need to go update the x 30 that creates these rows and the helper R 20.

Matthias Miller  1:20:55
The first thing here is we need to add a modify to set the add a column for the tax total tax and and set it.

Speaker 1  1:21:19
Oh, this is one of my ERGs. That little button has weird fuzzies when you're in dark mode. Anyway, do we? We don't have the tax amount right now, no.

Matthias Miller  1:21:38
Like this is where we need to do on the new row, like, we need to add it to the RLI macro. And for existing rows, it needs to come in from the existing thing. For the new one, we need to do, we just do a straight up appropriate, like, like A summer G type of thing. I

Unknown Speaker  1:22:38
what I think

Unknown Speaker  1:22:50
here. Add no if it's for current Yes, wait for current info. How are we calculating it?

Unknown Speaker  1:23:07
Do we need it in current info?

Matthias Miller  1:23:12
Yeah, we need to calculate in current info. So this is where we do a repeat RG on the existing to find that in for current info, we do a summer g of all historical rows minus summer G,

Matthias Miller  1:23:32
like, let's Well,

Matthias Miller  1:23:39
we're gonna it's the same logic that we created in the helper report, but we need to do it on the existing RG,

Unknown Speaker  1:23:49
aren't you essentially running on the whole RG, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:23:59
Where was that guy?

Matthias Miller  1:24:01
But we have a we have a macro to like an is current period macro,

Unknown Speaker  1:24:11
not the frequent, actually,

Matthias Miller  1:24:13
no, we also, yeah, right, no, no, that's not true.

Unknown Speaker  1:24:31
I'm not fully tracking where you're what you're thinking here.

Matthias Miller  1:24:36
Let's do this. Let's not, let's try it. Let's that.

Matthias Miller  1:24:53
So here, so this is. Account some tax history.

Unknown Speaker  1:25:08
This is looking across types. This isn't across types and weights.

Matthias Miller  1:25:14
Do we have one that looks within types?

Matthias Miller  1:25:25
No because we

Matthias Miller  1:25:36
keyless item.

Matthias Miller  1:25:50
This is just the rates. We're not actually storing tax amounts in here in the repeat list item.

Matthias Miller  1:26:03
So that means that we actually, I was wrong.

Matthias Miller  1:26:13
I think

Speaker 1  1:26:57
does look ROI, print, tax info, work are using something? Yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:27:18
let's try one of these. I

Matthias Miller  1:27:34
calc adjustment, I,

Matthias Miller  1:27:53
we went like a you,

Matthias Miller  1:28:06
okay, let's do it the terrible way. Well,

Unknown Speaker  1:28:17
is there no way we can Make this report easier work? It just feels

Unknown Speaker  1:28:47
you said you had 830, 10. Do you have something going now?

Matthias Miller  1:28:52
I should drop off in about five minutes. I

Matthias Miller  1:29:57
I'm. Bad Debt adjustment.

Unknown Speaker  1:30:16
You're going to need the bad debt payment ID too, or

Matthias Miller  1:30:21
you're I lost my place there sky. And yes, I'm wildly horribly duplicating code because time i

Matthias Miller  1:30:44
So this gets the

Matthias Miller  1:30:53
adjustment. Maybe this is just a dumb way to go about it. I

Matthias Miller  1:31:04
some tax history when we just do this, that

Matthias Miller  1:31:45
um, why am I struggling so much?

Unknown Speaker  1:31:49
Is this stuff is coming

Matthias Miller  1:31:51
that's fair. I'm trying to rush and it's getting in the way of getting it done. Um,

Matthias Miller  1:32:02
here. Let's do this. Let's at least as a starting

Unknown Speaker  1:36:08
This

Matthias Miller  1:37:39
not sure if this I'm not sure if that's correct or not, but Anyway,

Matthias Miller  1:38:01
oh, we do need it.

Unknown Speaker  1:38:11
How does this work? If jurisdiction changes,

Matthias Miller  1:38:20
it'll sum based on the jurisdiction.

Speaker 1  1:38:25
Sales Tax history, that was some tax history. James, I guess it should. I

Matthias Miller  1:38:44
wait a minute, why would we ever include historical rows

Unknown Speaker  1:38:50
like we do? It's just for calculations,

Unknown Speaker  1:38:59
like I think we

Unknown Speaker  1:39:08
look at what monk repeat list does.

Matthias Miller  1:39:14
Look at what look what monk repeat list.

Matthias Miller  1:39:22
BRG, Rose,

Matthias Miller  1:39:31
what does the subset do? Is

Unknown Speaker  1:39:41
that? How we do the words? Isn't that how we do the adjustments?

Speaker 1  1:39:54
Because we may have to adjust an existing row down to zero so. Because we can't just do a row for each history type, right?

Matthias Miller  1:40:09
That's how this is a list of all possible jurisdictions.

Unknown Speaker  1:40:15
Yeah, essentially jurisdictions and rates. Well, no, really, it is jurisdictions.

Matthias Miller  1:40:25
So this is basically Calc. This is irrelevant. I think I got a drop. But theoretically, then look

Matthias Miller  1:41:05
I mean, it probably should be something like,

Matthias Miller  1:41:19
nope, I've got no idea what I'm breaking, but we should see,

Matthias Miller  1:41:28
I don't know, no idea. Well, let's, let's pick it up to you're not working past five? Are you probably not?

Speaker 1  1:41:44
No, okay, I'm probably leaving the office at like 330 we're gonna go to the new

Matthias Miller  1:41:50
coffee shop. Nice. So let's

Unknown Speaker  1:41:56
up until 330 is an option, but probably not after that.

Matthias Miller  1:42:02
Let me just see what.

Matthias Miller  1:42:12
So let's I can do. I can potentially do it this afternoon after I'm going to work on do some solo time on the on the zfp spec, potentially one ish, I don't know yet what my day is going to be like. Okay, Central. I'll put, I'll send you a yeah, just put your name in there. Okay, awesome.

Unknown Speaker  1:42:38
The only thing I have is the RTO update, 215 So, yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:42:46
yeah, exactly, okay, good. Thank you, sir. Yep.
