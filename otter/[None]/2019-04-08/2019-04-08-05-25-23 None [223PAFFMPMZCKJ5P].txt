Speaker 1  00:05
out of my head. Number one, in order to raise money for the certification, I wonder if I could do a

Speaker 1  00:10
recharge event that is simply focused on bringing

Speaker 1  00:17
into leaders lives and helping them destroy the barriers that they face and the challenges that they face.

Speaker 1  00:25
So that was the first thing. And then I was thinking about some people I wanted to have have there and have a one person in particular No need, mentioning the name, but will

Unknown Speaker  00:37
control. And I nearly saw a picture

Speaker 1  00:39
of two, two minds at work. And it was like there was one mind another person's mind that was actually controlling this, this

Speaker 1  00:49
first person's mind. And one of the things I realized with it is that, I mean, that's part of how the the voice of control works. But first of all, it's this prevailing thought of what is this other person sake, and I'm going to substitute what I think for what they think. And, and so that's, that's number one. Number two, then

Unknown Speaker  01:13
when, when this other person

Speaker 1  01:18
yields themselves into the spirit controls, and then it gives the enemy an opportunity to hijack that, and to basically anoint their words with power. So that when when they say something, it takes up residence, physical residents and other people's minds, and prevents them from being able to make clear rational decisions. And

Unknown Speaker  01:47
and so there's this

Speaker 1  01:50
there's this demonic force that you can partner with, that

Unknown Speaker  01:56
when you're controlling other people,

Speaker 1  01:58
that reinforces your thoughts for other people. And it gives it takes away other people's ability to think for themselves. And anytime that you take away somebody's ability to think for themselves, you are inherently

Speaker 1  02:10
yielding to a spirit of control and manipulation.

Speaker 1  02:17
And this could apply to leadership, it can apply to marketing.

Speaker 1  02:23
One of the things that's really detrimental about the whole NLP

Unknown Speaker  02:27
marketing thing is that

Speaker 1  02:29
ends up looking for ways to corrosively control what other people are thinking, and it might be effective. And

Unknown Speaker  02:41
maybe

Speaker 1  02:44
you're not sure but but there are times certainly when this is just becoming another form of mind control. And you end up partnering with something that is really not that goes

Speaker 1  02:56
beyond just the natural tools of persuasion into

Speaker 1  03:01
partnering with something that that really isn't healthy,

Unknown Speaker  03:06
to get people to change.

Speaker 1  03:10
Now, with every counterfeit, there's also the real, and I think part of the real is this place where, where you're up, you get well first of all, obviously, you can think the thoughts of Christ. And so you have this clear headed and so it's not just about you, it's about accessing the thoughts and in, in the third heaven and, and getting to know Jesus thoughts and what he's what he's all about.

Speaker 1  03:38
I think a huge key to break through that is just understanding that this is a demonic influence. And that your war is not against the person who's who's thinking like this, that there's actually an external entity that seeks to control and and the only way that you can get three is when that entity gets gets sidelined, in the name of Jesus. And

Speaker 1  04:09
I think part of this comes down to learning to

Unknown Speaker  04:14
rely on the truth and the wisdom and the presence and power

Unknown Speaker  04:17
of God. So that

Unknown Speaker  04:20
when you are in that kind of situation,

Unknown Speaker  04:24
the

Unknown Speaker  04:24
power of God within you and the end and the angels

Speaker 1  04:27
of God bind up as those things so that those things do not have a grip or it or do not have an effect on you.

Speaker 1  04:39
Like that's really profound. That's really profound.
