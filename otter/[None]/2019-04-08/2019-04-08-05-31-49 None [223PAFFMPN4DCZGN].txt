Speaker 1  00:01
There are three parts to getting recharged, the first of all, is getting rid of the things in your past that are weighing you down. And it's just like a runner is a runner is running forward, and

Unknown Speaker  00:13
he's dragging all this

Unknown Speaker  00:14
stuff along behind them, then

Speaker 1  00:19
yeah, it's going to slow down, it doesn't matter how strong he is, he's always going to be living underneath his potential, because he's got this stuff that he's pulling along

Speaker 1  00:28
behind him. And the sooner that you can offload these things,

Unknown Speaker  00:34
and break

Unknown Speaker  00:34
free from these, that you really don't

Speaker 1  00:36
have to do anything different. Things just start to change the start moving and moving more quickly, and,

Unknown Speaker  00:41
and you're actually able to get momentum.

Unknown Speaker  00:47
So that's

Speaker 1  00:47
the past and the present, a lot of the things come come down to

Speaker 1  00:53
what are the things that you've taken on and the things that you're carrying? And the things that you have it offloaded, we're going

Unknown Speaker  01:00
to create a solution for and, and,

Speaker 1  01:06
and then what does that was that kind of look like for you. So that's, and that's

Unknown Speaker  01:13
one way that you deal with deal with the present.

Speaker 1  01:18
There's, there's things like creating alignment is a major piece, Bill I met with you that created you to be and, and all that. And then and then part three, the future

Unknown Speaker  01:30
is really shifting it from

Unknown Speaker  01:36
you can

Speaker 1  01:36
get away from just running from something, you can actually focus on what you're creating in the future.

Unknown Speaker  01:42
That is where

Unknown Speaker  01:44
the power and momentum really happen.

Speaker 1  01:51
You get sucked into almost like a second to a vortex that that pulls you

Unknown Speaker  01:56
ahead. It's really, really profound.

Unknown Speaker  02:03
There's another way that you can actually slice and dice it, which

Speaker 1  02:05
is also in terms of a healthy mind. And a recharged mind, a recharged heart and a recharge body.

Speaker 1  02:22
I Wow. Like that's really powerful. That's really powerful.

Unknown Speaker  02:32
Because what happens when you recharge your

Unknown Speaker  02:36
so you recharge your

Speaker 1  02:38
batteries are recharged, it doesn't matter any of these other things, everything's breaking down for you. There's just

Speaker 1  02:44
no way around it. And you know that this comes down to making sure you're hydrated, pursuing health, healthy nutrition and,

Speaker 1  02:55
and making sure you're rested and you've got the rest that you need, whatever that

Speaker 1  03:00
exactly looks like. And there's there has to be a willingness to pay the price, in order to reap the benefit, you can't just you can't just run your body into the ground.

Unknown Speaker  03:12
There's a law of diminishing returns. And when you do that,

Unknown Speaker  03:15
you're actually borrowing from the future.

Speaker 1  03:18
And you're diminishing the outcomes that you're that you're going to create. This only works if you're at you're at a very basic, Primal level, it doesn't work at the point

Speaker 1  03:29
that you get into high level leadership, this becomes a very detrimental habit. And, you

Unknown Speaker  03:35
know, I would probably argue it's

Unknown Speaker  03:36
actually detrimental early on, because

Speaker 1  03:38
you end up making short term non strategic decisions, and it puts you into fight or flight very quickly.

Unknown Speaker  03:48
But

Speaker 1  03:51
but especially as you grow and leadership is super important for you to be able to think to be able to be physically rested, so that you have your top cognitive abilities.

Unknown Speaker  04:09
For the

Speaker 1  04:09
clear mind, I think one of the things we could do is that we do get to start out with like a five minutes

Unknown Speaker  04:16
free

Unknown Speaker  04:16
journaling exercise and so not to edit or not to do

Unknown Speaker  04:19
anything else, just what's on your mind,

Unknown Speaker  04:21
what are you thinking about?

Unknown Speaker  04:23
It just gives your

Speaker 1  04:25
brain and hours for that. So you start out with that just to kind

Speaker 1  04:28
of get the pump point and and then you give them another five minutes on, on what is it? What are the challenges that I'm facing? And and what what what are the things that actually weighing you down, and then open up for discussion around that and share around that. And then And then number three would

Speaker 1  04:46
be the worst things that I could be doing in order to offload this and

Unknown Speaker  04:55
goodness oh, this

Speaker 1  04:56
could be amazing and and then just allowing them to process so

Speaker 1  05:00
these things with with themselves first of all and

Unknown Speaker  05:04
then with the rest of the group and

Speaker 1  05:09
and and just give them opportunity for breakthrough with that.

Speaker 1  05:15
I think one of the things that the click Clear heart for the recharge part is being able to engage with other people to restore life into your heart. But it's also being able and willing to deal with

Speaker 1  05:33
wounded as I think some of this becomes come from the same clear mind exercise that centered around what is the lies that I believing? And and what are the things that are kind of holding you back.

Unknown Speaker  05:48
Another question that you could

Speaker 1  05:49
ask is what are the things that they cause your heart to become discouraged?

Unknown Speaker  05:55
And

Unknown Speaker  05:58
oh wow,

Unknown Speaker  05:58
that's really be there's a on that
