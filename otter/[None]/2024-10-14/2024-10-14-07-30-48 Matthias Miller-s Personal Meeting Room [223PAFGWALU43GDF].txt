Matthias Miller  02:03
Quick, quick, quick thing before we dive in, Josh gave his sign off on requiring vendor invoice status. All right, so if you want to put it on your paper cut list to have Seth do that sometime and prioritize it

Unknown Speaker  02:27
for what was that? Sorry, requiring

Matthias Miller  02:29
the vendor invoice status about that. He's good with

Speaker 1  02:37
it. I just wanted

Matthias Miller  02:41
to make sure he there was there wasn't any issue, because it's oh okay in his territory. So he's happy with it. Seth, could do it if you just add it to your paper cut list and prioritize, okay? It is no,

Unknown Speaker  02:53
yeah, number six on the send you an email with some is that going to be on today?

Matthias Miller  02:59
This morning? Yeah, he's running a few minutes late, but he'll be, he'll be here. Okay, good. Well,

Unknown Speaker  03:05
why don't we go to this? Yeah,

Speaker 1  03:06
we've got two sales orders that we've got. They were, they were mistakenly invoice later canceled. They never should have been invoice. And the the problem we have now is they're still stuck in accounting and showing a negative, showing a negative sale amount. But you want to Dwayne. Dwayne tried to fix, fix them. And I, I think it's because they were, I think it's because of the sequence on the event. So they're not responding. I

Unknown Speaker  03:52
did you send those? No,

Unknown Speaker  03:53
it's the first one is 2401559,

Speaker 2  04:02
that one. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  04:11
all

Unknown Speaker  04:16
right, so yeah,

Matthias Miller  04:22
I mean, currently on cancelation, we create a reversal invoice date, so when you uninvoiced it, I guess basically what should happen is, if you cancel, we shouldn't do a reversal. If it's not invoiced. Let me see if, see if I'm right. Exclude rows on or after reverse any there is no cancelation invoice rows.

Unknown Speaker  04:52
Wait, why is that? No? We shouldn't have any cancelation rows,

Unknown Speaker  04:58
appliances on two.

Unknown Speaker  05:05
Sales Order canceled.

Unknown Speaker  05:09
I get hope so I put that coat. Oh,

Unknown Speaker  05:25
it should have been voided

Speaker 1  05:33
in the only thing we were concerned about at this point is that it would void the transaction. Basically,

Unknown Speaker  05:45
right?

Speaker 1  05:47
Okay, it's it. It should void the transaction. And it's also showing on the FGI calculations by sales, which is not a big deal, but it's, it's showing on that report as well a

Speaker 3  06:01
large transactions. Let's go take a look see if there were any errors on this one morning. Seth,

Unknown Speaker  06:14
alright, you can do it because

Matthias Miller  06:20
it's not, I mean, it's, it is no longer showing any

Speaker 3  06:22
really weird sound

Speaker 2  06:30
guards. It no longer hit the channel you

Speaker 3  06:54
Well, everything comes right countered warnings and transactions, so strike,

Unknown Speaker  07:17
okay, Well, let's I

Unknown Speaker  07:20
can maybe I can maybe troubleshoot that.

Speaker 1  07:25
Do you want the the number for the other one as well?

Matthias Miller  07:28
Yeah, let me give me one second so I can pull up.

Speaker 3  07:40
I fire.

Speaker 2  07:46
All

Unknown Speaker  07:54
right, not waiting. All right, yes, the other 12401558,

Unknown Speaker  08:07
just one less than the other one.

Matthias Miller  08:12
Okay, let's actually try this.

Unknown Speaker  08:32
It was sort of a point. It's Lisa that's now,

Matthias Miller  08:43
well, that's good enough.

Speaker 3  08:46
I will take it. Take a look at this morning. Let's see what's going on.

Speaker 1  08:53
So in the meantime, we're wanting to complete financial statements today. Is that like is this something you're going to do? Well, we need to push an update or what, what's required

Matthias Miller  09:12
to, I don't know yet. I can look at it as soon as we're done with the call,

Speaker 1  09:17
sure. And we can also just manually remove it if, yeah, we could, if need be, but yeah, just let us know what you

Speaker 4  09:30
find on the another thing, Stripe fees, I believe I sent an email on Friday to do you know anything, what needs done there, or what we're looking at.

Matthias Miller  09:45
I will sketch the in the office. I'll take a look after our call as well. On that one.

Unknown Speaker  09:53
That's fine. Okay, okay, do. Good morning. Set morning. So

Speaker 1  10:07
there's, I think the highlighted ones, there were just things we talked about last Thursday. Just wanted to go through those. Let's see if those number one there. I think most of this was going to go live the 12,

Speaker 5  10:32
as long as there was an update, then that should all be done. I think okay, and it looks like it was updated. So, yeah, that should be

Speaker 1  10:42
okay. Yeah. Two was just notes from last time, uh, approved to use more than monthly development quote if needed on the sales tax because you'd mentioned it. Yeah, yeah. Keep us posted where you're going with that, as far as, like, if it's a lot more Sure. Um, and then 123, and four, I think was, was also was was down or close to being done.

Speaker 5  11:15
One through three were done already. I did number four. I also did number five. Then, okay, that one, the prefix to use there is at,

Unknown Speaker  11:30
at,

Speaker 5  11:32
accounting transaction got it so, and then that should be working.

Matthias Miller  11:39
Is that visible on the it's not visible anywhere in the record. No,

Speaker 5  11:44
it's not. I wondered if I should change that or not.

Matthias Miller  11:51
I mean, for context which you can do. This is not the friendliest, but short term, let's copy this number bracket, bracket at number bracket, bracket.

Unknown Speaker  12:07
And that was the ID number, right? I didn't see where you were.

Matthias Miller  12:10
Yeah, it's this, this number up top. Yeah, okay,

Unknown Speaker  12:16
that should work

Matthias Miller  12:18
good. I think Seth, yes, it would be good. I don't know where I don't I don't even know that it has to be done. Should?

Speaker 5  12:29
Should I just throw it on the record for insight or because right now the memo link is only for insight, not for other systems.

Matthias Miller  12:45
I mean, if it's, if the memo link is only for insight, then yes, you should, yeah, just have a custom in that case, you could do something. I mean, you

Unknown Speaker  12:54
could probably even you

Matthias Miller  12:59
could override this if you really wanted to, probably

Speaker 5  13:01
I could. The problem is, the places where we search for ID don't take it into account. So take more work.

Unknown Speaker  13:09
Got it, that's why.

Unknown Speaker  13:12
All right, I wasn't

Unknown Speaker  13:13
sure what to do. Blank spot here,

Speaker 5  13:21
or even, is it fine if it's not on a customized for Insider? Is that too far away? That's

Matthias Miller  13:25
perfect? No, it's perfect.

Unknown Speaker  13:27
Okay,

Unknown Speaker  13:28
I'll do that.

Unknown Speaker  13:34
Six drew in.

Speaker 1  13:39
Oh, you'd said, let's do this alongside sales tax reporting, because it would be helpful

Unknown Speaker  13:45
to have this,

Speaker 1  13:48
yeah, require status on vendor and guys, I think wasn't that that you had right rather than, rather than push this one out, yeah, if we could do this one alongside sales tax, that would be,

Unknown Speaker  14:05
would be helpful.

Speaker 4  14:08
Have we heard anything trashful? And then you're saying, leave the rest till after. So I think that's yeah. I

Speaker 1  14:13
think this was the one that you'd said, I forget what? Oh, this. This caused some false alarms, I believe, in some false duplications, or,

Unknown Speaker  14:26
yeah, anybody's double paid some stuff. I mean, it all gets straightened out eventually, but

Unknown Speaker  14:35
yeah, still, it's a pain.

Speaker 1  14:39
Now, anytime you start getting into using credits and stuff. It gets messier. Thank you. So good. You have what you need there. Then Matthias before you roll. And said that, Josh signed off on this. So, okay,

Speaker 5  14:55
okay, then I can do that pretty easily. I think, okay, do. Yeah, good.

Speaker 1  15:04
I think that's all we had, right? I mean, other than sales tax reporting, if there's anything to cover or look at,

Speaker 5  15:11
I don't think I've got the fielding in place. I started working on logic for reporting or for automatically creating Well, the logic to create rows basically haven't gotten very far with that yet, but I asked Matthias a couple of questions. I don't think I really have questions at this point.

Speaker 1  15:35
Good. So at this point, it's still looking like what is our target date? End of first? Well, we say October 31 but first, first week in November. That still looks doable, I

Speaker 5  15:47
think. So I'm going to try to buckle down and work on it quite a bit this week, because I'd like to knock out as much as I can this week so it doesn't start running close,

Unknown Speaker  15:56
but good. Um,

Speaker 1  16:01
oh, as far So, our next meeting would be october 24 Yeah, next Thursday, and then what about the following week? Have you had a chance to look at schedule Matthias? What would work on? Yeah,

Matthias Miller  16:21
so yeah, after my momentary freak out of thinking perhaps I didn't, yep. So after, after momentary freak out of thinking that perhaps I didn't buy my wife one leg of the trips because we decided to do two airlines all the all day on the 31st so options would be, I mean,

Matthias Miller  16:59
Wednesday, Wednesday Monday and Wednesday would be options League. I'm not sure whether, yeah, I don't know. I don't know what, what that what that week looks like for you guys

Speaker 1  17:14
there. I don't know that there's really a difference for me. I'd say to if you have a preference or set monday wednesday,

Speaker 4  17:21
like Wednesday is better, but it's

Matthias Miller  17:29
if Wednesday afternoon's an option, oh, go ahead.

Speaker 5  17:36
I'll be I'm traveling Tuesday, so I'm in I'm out east again, then Wednesday, which work that would work fine to call. So actually on Monday or Wednesday would work fine.

Speaker 1  17:52
So Matthias said Wednesday afternoon. I mean, I think Wednesday afternoon would work like you take the time and,

Matthias Miller  18:01
I mean, I would just whenever is good for the end of your day,

Speaker 1  18:05
and probably 130 to three, yeah, usually leave it It's good, right? If

Speaker 4  18:12
we stop at three, that would be great. 132 three, all right, I

Unknown Speaker  18:22
am sending the invite now.

Unknown Speaker  18:26
So this would be the 30/30,

Matthias Miller  18:29
right? 30th? Yeah, I think that's better. Hey, the other option would actually be, No, I'm talking about two sides of my mouth, also, just like a nine o'clock or 930

Unknown Speaker  18:46
Do you guys have a preference?

Unknown Speaker  18:53
I'd go with the afternoon one. But

Unknown Speaker  18:55
that's good. That's good.

Unknown Speaker  18:58
I like anything, anything else, see

Unknown Speaker  19:07
if you have anything. No,

Unknown Speaker  19:09
I think I do. But while

Speaker 1  19:11
you look through I'm just curious, any more a guy called me, was it hostetlers For as a reference to doing work with you guys. It sounded like they were, he was pretty much. He just had to get Board approval to move on, move ahead. So has that? Has that moved forward at all? Are you guys involved with that?

Speaker 5  19:36
It's a dreadfully slow process, from what I've heard. It hasn't, it's not confirmed yet. But keep moving the glacier, inch by inch.

Speaker 1  19:48
They are a huge operation, the way it sounds, 100 I can understand why slowly, because 2323 owners, and I think 120 Five boys, plus another, like, 200 subs that they work with. It's, it's, yeah, ridiculous. Actually, maybe they're guys from Missouri. What is it? I think they go by the name pasta Atlas. Is it they build turnkey? Is it turkey or chicken houses? They have, like, multiple locations. And

Unknown Speaker  20:20
he said, there is this, what do they call themselves, Mennonite?

Speaker 1  20:30
He said, Look at he said, there, yeah, Amish Mennonite is calling

Unknown Speaker  20:35
on a sleeping preacher.

Unknown Speaker  20:38
Okay, yeah,

Speaker 4  20:41
that's interesting. They definitely go about things in a large way there. Yeah,

Speaker 1  20:51
well, that'll be so are both of you going to be involved with that once it gets started? Or not sure yet, or

Speaker 5  20:59
I don't know for sure about me. I mean, I'm I'm guessing I'll end up doing at least some with it, but I don't know for sure.

Speaker 1  21:09
Yeah, interesting. He said he they might come through the area again, so this fall, if you'd like to stop, probably be underwhelmed if he sees our office. I Ah,

Speaker 3  21:28
wow. Yeah, interesting. Yeah, good. So, yeah, we're good to go. We

Unknown Speaker  21:38
are good,

Unknown Speaker  21:40
good, thank you.

Matthias Miller  21:42
Good, awesome. We'll be in touch as soon as I find stuff here. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  21:45
that'll be great. Thank you. Thank you. Bye.
