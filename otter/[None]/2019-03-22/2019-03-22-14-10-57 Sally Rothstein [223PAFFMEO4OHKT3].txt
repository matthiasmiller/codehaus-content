Matthias Miller  00:00
Does your feedback on that?

Speaker 1  00:02
Cool? Um, yeah. So what what would be I'm just going to be leaving my car and walking back into my office. So I'm just going to transition here.

Speaker 1  00:14
Are you looking? Is there something specific? That would be helpful? or? Yeah, yeah, I mean,

Matthias Miller  00:22
did you get out of it? Well, first of all, did you get out of it? what you expected to get out of it? That's, I think that's my first question. Yeah, you know,

Speaker 1  00:29
I did, I think, I also really appreciate where you're coming from. In fact, I just finished my DNA survey just about a couple of hours ago, and gave some feedback in there as well. So it's great to be able to give it, give it to you.

Speaker 1  00:52
I really, I think you have you practice what you preach. And I can have a lot of a lot of experience offer, and then credibility, because you've got some experience. And,

Unknown Speaker  01:05
and I happened to,

Speaker 1  01:08
I probably use just different languages. But what you did was accessible, I think, to the masses. And I think just like, getting, getting clear on what you're wanting people to do is really the key. And then and then getting aligned on that, you know,

Unknown Speaker  01:27
so I

Speaker 1  01:27
really, I think we offer and we people just jumped into stuff without the clarity and without the focus, and without the time to make sure that everybody knows, you know, what's needed. And then we have to backtrack a lot. So I, I especially like, what, you know,

Speaker 1  01:49
just resonated with what you were saying.

Speaker 1  01:54
Try and practice that myself. So that was just a nice to have another person on the planet who

Speaker 1  02:02
and is dedicated to helping us all, you know, get get there.

Speaker 1  02:11
So I liked, yes, I liked a lot of like, a lot of what you had to say and how how you said it, they don't have to go back to my notes, which I haven't done just to get some specifics.

Unknown Speaker  02:26
So I'm sorry about that. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  02:29
that's, that's not a problem

Speaker 1  02:32
that I will offer. And you pronounce your name, Matthias

Matthias Miller  02:38
Yeah, that's right. This is

Speaker 1  02:42
offer the workbook. So I really understand

Speaker 1  02:47
your approach and, and engaging learners and making the learning stick more, you know, by engaging people the ended up I think, in the end, kind of distracting from

Speaker 1  03:01
what you were doing. Because, you know, people were, some people were more focused on making sure they had the right answers. And writing them down versus really like taking it in. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  03:15
So

Speaker 1  03:16
there's a sweet spot with. And I've got a actually long, pretty long background with training and development, and there's just the sweet spot, you know, of how to engage in a way that doesn't distract from or how to how to hook an anchor the learning, without distracting from the learning?

Matthias Miller  03:33
Sure. That's very helpful. Yeah. Yeah. Um, is it a matter of of shortening it up? Is it a matter of maybe to stitching it? Or what would you see as? Yeah,

Speaker 1  03:48
I think because, you know, you your language was really aligned with the workbook that if people didn't know that you were actually giving an answer? Right, then in there, you know what I mean, then, then you'd miss it. Yeah, and,

Speaker 1  04:05
and then, and when there's a blame, something very specific has to go in the blank are not satisfied.

Speaker 1  04:17
In a feel like you haven't bought it. So to some, you know,

Speaker 1  04:24
if you wanted to use the book, which I think it I mean, I've certainly seen that approach work really well. But you have to kind of walk through it, you know, next next in your book card, number five in your book, or, you know, some how really continuously, but again, without distracting from

Unknown Speaker  04:48
you don't want that to become the focus.

Matthias Miller  04:50
Yep. Yep. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  04:53
that makes that makes sense. And that's, that's really good feedback. Because this is, this is one of the first times I predict together, I mean, I've done other presentations, before that I put together a workbook. And it is a little bit of a new field for me. So that's, that's really helpful feedback. And I, you know,

Matthias Miller  05:14
I've got another good colleague of mine, who's who does a good bit of work in, in training as well. learning, learning stuff, so I'll run it actually run it past him to and, and get some feedback from him. And he might have some ideas on how to how to streamline that, but cool, good. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  05:32
Great. Great. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  05:36
I

Speaker 1  05:39
hope you all have to make the workbook the focus of the learning, but but effectively, versus just speaking, it's too hard to listen, and read and write at the same time.

Matthias Miller  05:54
Right. Yeah.

Speaker 1  05:55
So if you're using the workbook as an actual, you know, to guide the conversation, that's that that one thing? And then you can, you know, but it's just a matter of Oh, wait, I think he just said what I needed to write down.

Unknown Speaker  06:12
Then Then it's just it's just hard, you know? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  06:14
Good. Well, fantastic. Yeah. Fantastic. That's, that's super helpful. That's really helpful. I'm good. I'm also putting together some, some RFP or the some some speaking, some breakout session proposals for for Denver. So if if you have any kind of ideas of, obviously, you don't know, my, my expertise, and all I'll filter the lineup with my expertise, but if you've got ideas of things that you'd love to hear about, I'm, I'm all ears. Yeah.

Speaker 1  06:50
Thanks. And I haven't, I was nice that you shared your book. I haven't taken a look at it yet.

Speaker 1  06:58
And so that'll be the least under reach to at some point. And that was an excellent. Yeah,

Speaker 1  07:08
I think you have I, personally, I have facilitated

Speaker 1  07:16
deep dive conversation around what you're talking about. And, again, the delegation. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  07:26
I

Speaker 1  07:28
will sound to first of all, I have to be clear before I can delegate, you know, what do I need people to do? So I just think the world needs more of like a message getting getting clear ourselves. You know,

Speaker 1  07:41
so that we can help our results happen the way? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  07:47
I would say that.

Unknown Speaker  07:50
Sure. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  07:54
Sounds good. Thank you. Thanks, it. Thanks a ton for your time. I really appreciate it.

Speaker 1  07:58
Absolutely. Take care. All right. Yep. Take it away.
