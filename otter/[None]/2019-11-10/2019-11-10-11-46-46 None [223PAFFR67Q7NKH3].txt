There's an interesting observation that I've always hated doing the same thing twice this is one of the things that often got me in trouble. This is also one of the things I hated about API work because I felt like after I did the first conversion. It was much the same thing but also within each conversion there was a lot of the same thing that was going on, a sense of progress can certainly help with that. And certainly, understanding the meta narrative can also help with that.
