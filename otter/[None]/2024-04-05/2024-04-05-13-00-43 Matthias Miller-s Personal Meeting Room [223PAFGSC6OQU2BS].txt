Unknown Speaker  00:35
My name is

Matthias Miller  00:41
how are you doing?

Speaker 1  00:45
Doing well I've got about six hours extra time here at work than I was planning on today so we've kind of we were going to take lunch to school and our daughter was sick this morning so change plans on that so I stayed at work so

Matthias Miller  01:13
well sorry to hear about your daughter I expect you're grateful in the Workfront so that's a mixed Yeah. All right, well, I started digging into AR stuff and Aaron customer deposits and everything was going quite well until I started realizing that I think there's a chance that we won't be able to completely balance that there are transactions that transferred between AR and customer deposits where we don't want the AR part of it but we do want the deposit part of it

Speaker 1  02:09
okay, like what what are these let me see

Matthias Miller  02:23
Alright, so here we have one make sure this Okay, so for ADC the customer deposits we were expecting 72 five to 75 Okay, on just one note, on one sales order, we had a 3164 write off that apparently got added since since we last us last put it on here but let me see where to find example. Sales Order 23052452. And that is ABC. So if I go over to this would be c is this district X or is this? Yeah, this is district x if I go over into my district exe file and

Matthias Miller  03:32
this one has an outstanding balance of an overpayment of 2175. There is $1,000. Payment so there's a transaction with $1,000 debit to customer deposits. It has the discounts and income and it has a five nine and 806 debit of AR as well. So we are not wanting this to show up in your customer deposits

Matthias Miller  04:24
what's the why is that oil in the end I'm confused. This shouldn't be showing a balance and customer deposits because we had a

Matthias Miller  04:51
on 1121

Matthias Miller  04:58
Was your This is

Unknown Speaker  05:02
Oh, I was just Well, I just opened up the sales order here as well. What when was it? What day was it invoiced?

Matthias Miller  05:13
Was invoice 616 of 23.

Speaker 1  05:24
So, the $1,000 payment should have would have been customer deposits, but then that would have moved out of there. And nothing else should have gone into customer deposits, right.

Matthias Miller  05:43
Okay, so the know, the issue is that the closet was made in May, which is when it came into customer deposits, but we don't have that part of the transaction

Matthias Miller  06:08
we only have it's because it's split. So on 526 They made a payment that would have it would have come into customer deposits. On 616 It was sold it came out of customer deposits, which makes the balance sheet appear to be negative 1000. And then it shows AR but we need the the AR transfer transaction on the 16th as well as on the 28th when the balance was paid to handle the AR balance so I guess the real issue is the initial credit to customer deposits was never made.

Speaker 1  07:00
And this one's still hanging out in the out right. So yes. Which is why why the so can can we manually Can you just manually enter it? That initial transaction?

Matthias Miller  07:18
I mean, I could let's see, but there's also is it

Speaker 1  07:23
well would it be better to adjust

Speaker 1  07:35
that you could also adjust the existing transactions that are there right?

Matthias Miller  07:41
Yeah, we could

Matthias Miller  07:52
what I wish we would have done instead

Matthias Miller  08:01
we could still maybe take a look at doing this. If we would say that for historical transactions anything that was invoiced that we include all deposits

Matthias Miller  08:25
Well, here's how we can say it for any sales order that is that for which we have a deposit or we have AR we make sure that we include all of their auto generated transactions even if they would have been generated before June 1 And we manually modified the process to go create those historical ones so that way for each building or sales order we have the entire picture and there's not this half of this half of the other thing going on

Speaker 1  08:56
yeah I like that and there's there's probably very few of those out there anymore now that were you know because it was basically have to be something that was one half of the transaction happened or doing the other half after that and it still has to be an AR at the end of the year yeah, I think that's a good that makes sense then that way you look back at these they're counting should all meet ends it's not you won't need to remember Oh this was could have been or this could have happened before June

Matthias Miller  09:49
Thank you choose that. I also have not done anything yet with the Yeah, I mean, I was working working through this stuff late last night, I just didn't get to the sorry, I didn't get to the to the asset import at this point. So I don't know that we've got, I don't think we've got a ton of resources to offload it. you potentially have Bangladesh, take a look at it. I don't know if it's worth the time of offloading. But either way. I think you'll have at least a little bit of time this weekend, hopefully check some of this stuff down. mind doing that.

Speaker 1  10:42
Now, there's you sent me three emails. Last night, one this morning? Should we look at those as well? The other AR discs? Are those all resolved with what?

Matthias Miller  11:03
No, these are not resolved. So between the email that I got, if you're comparing totals for AR, you're going to find these differences. So

Speaker 1  11:22
I'm curious if because through send me an updated balance sheet this for noon, that said, these are reflecting numbers that

Matthias Miller  11:37
that

Speaker 1  11:38
provide you've been doing or he said I did, I made no changes to AR and

Matthias Miller  11:44
customer deposits. So in this case, I don't think I was operating on an old spreadsheet if he would have compared it with the live spreadsheet, or the live AR, it should have died out. But I believe based on the spreadsheets I was using, you would if you were using those totals you would see up like in North Carolina, you would see a $4,062 AR discrepancy

Matthias Miller  12:21
which

Speaker 1  12:24
and so, did somebody record a payment in that timeframe? That changed that? Yeah.

Matthias Miller  12:30
Let me see that history. lesson was drew put in a payment yesterday. Well, you change the payment from 2024 to 2023.

Matthias Miller  12:48
We would that's why. Yeah.

Speaker 1  12:53
That's that's on 26446023.

Matthias Miller  12:59
Yes.

Speaker 1  13:03
So okay, what that means then is okay, then the aarC that was using what would have updated would reflect that.

Speaker 1  13:19
Well, as would your number. But I think the only thing we have to do is, is to go back to Whitney and tell her Hey, the journal entry, or here's an updated number to use for AR balance as of 1231. B

Unknown Speaker  13:48
or a 62? Lower than what? At what we had given her. You

Matthias Miller  13:55
Yes. And Drew went in and changed the sales order manually. And they found the underlying transaction and fix the underlying transaction manually as well. So that's why

Speaker 1  14:15
so are we so other than that, you're saying the AR send me balance sheet as of 1231 for vinyl structures. At least take a look you're showing. Number You're showing B

Speaker 1  15:06
I'm showing expecting you would show $882,419.24 What up? Still running?

Matthias Miller  15:50
All right. $882,418.24

Unknown Speaker  15:59
That's what I'm showing. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  16:02
Yeah, that's what I'm seeing on the balance sheet. Perfect. Well,

Unknown Speaker  16:05
so the only thing that does that concerns me a little bit. Okay. No, any. Okay. Any changes? What was the situation that? Any changes? Yeah, what the situation was, but any,

Speaker 1  16:35
like if if or cold or were to go in and update the record payments from last year that for whatever reason you were missing on the sales order and even on the accounts receivable report that you build, everything would look correct accounting just would not match that, because you've severed the tie between those actions and what happens in accounting for all of 23. Right? That's right. And if that happens, then we would have ways to diagnose

Unknown Speaker  17:14
or Well, okay, let me try to make this more clear on what and the only way this number can change. Add to number could change is if realize if you are drew or to go in and change transactions. That's right.

Speaker 1  17:39
So that number is pretty solid, then if if if that situation that I just described happens, where we say, Oh, the sales order, got to record a payment 23 We do that sales order heroes out? The AR reports look correct. But the AR reports don't match with accounting? Do we have ways that we can diagnose then and see what happened? We could can. Like, we'll be able to see that they're not pushing across to accounting.

Matthias Miller  18:23
Well, at some point, we want to create an error, I think, or something that keeps them from doing that. If they're adding new payments. Well

Matthias Miller  18:42
part of the challenge is we are manually introducing discrepant work on purpose introducing discrepancies. So let me think this a little bit. We could look at

Matthias Miller  19:08
and what is the best way to do this? Because you have to distinguish.

Speaker 1  19:17
I think what we would want to do is if we'd say oh, there's $5,000, we did not record me three and it should have been recorded in 23. We would say, Oh 23 is closed, we can change those numbers. We'll just have to record that payment as of January one, even though we even it's highly unlikely but even though the check was written out. Number 27. We'll just have to date it every one because the prior period has been closed already. I think that's what we would have to do now. Right now there's nothing preventing the law or people in in the office from doing that. Which is why? My question on if we have tools to diagnose that if we could say, oh, they're not lining up. So oh, here's what happened, these two payments, somebody made back here. A transactions for them in funding period that's still open. Oh.

Speaker 1  20:43
I, I know that Larry had talked about this. And I think what he basic simplistic onset concept that I got was that if if that happens, he just, the people recording the payments do their thing they don't, they still record the payment as of August 27. But accounting says, Oh, you're trying to do this in a closed period. Don't but know that it's closed, you don't have to know. But I'm just going to be smart about it and move it forward to the first available date in an open period. And the accountants happy. And the person entering the the information is at the end, and life goes on. That's my was my understanding of what he does when he gets to like the end of a month. And he can't he, at some point, when he wants to numbers from moving, he's saying, okay, here, here is our days from the end of the month, where we are on the last day of the month. So income cannot continue to change on me just based on everyone's actions, AR cannot continue to change. So he does something like like that, basically. I don't know if that makes sense or not. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  22:22
Yes. And does this happen?

Matthias Miller  22:33
Automatically, is there a manual process that says, what date do you want this posted as?

Speaker 1  22:44
I think it's an it's an automatic process,

Matthias Miller  22:47
like the controller or whoever's

Speaker 1  22:52
someone who would be responsible for setting those timeframes. Obviously, yeah, like, I, I want to close this period. By the I think we could go as simplistic as I think once we close a period, get the terminology close or freeze a period once we close a period, rather than just not create accounting transactions at all, we should just have them jump forward to the first available day. And what that would do is it would it would create some usual transactions sometimes like you start seeing stuff show up. First day of the open period. Why do we have this revenue posted here, but it at least would not just get lost in?

Speaker 1  23:56
Yeah, I don't know that this is something we have to figure out just now. I mean, we can ask Larry about it. And we can set up a time. We're probably going to meet with him later this month. If it were helpful, but I'm doing too much of the talking here. So sure you're buying spinning on ideas.

Matthias Miller  24:16
I mean, I think I think your approach is reasonable in the short term. Could we do something very similar to what we did this year and have a tie up process? So what were the payments? Well, no, because they're backdated in a historical period, which means they're not going to show up. It's gonna say is there some kind of reporting that we can do to compare what asis says IMS, etc, versus the accounting system but you can't do that without

Matthias Miller  24:55
that gets tricky. I think it's First, like you're just suggesting makes sense. Next steps would be for you to talk to Larry figure out what you want from a business standpoint and then let's talk about how to integrate it

Speaker 1  25:15
and in the interim, we'll just, well, okay, I don't think it'd be that hard like in the interim for AR, or customer deposits, we have those reports and we can compare them side by side like we're doing 880,000 accounting things, it's slightly less or slightly more probably have ways to

Matthias Miller  25:40
get here, here's the bottom line, if we want to read report to define the discrepancies, what we can do is say go look at all ignore all transactions that were created yesterday and today and however long this takes me by me in this time period, because those are by definition expected discrepancies. Now go look at everything else and go look for any place where there's a sales order that are something that should generate a transaction in historical period and it doesn't exist and and yes, it's a little bit of an unmarked Office report to write but we can just based off of that criteria right there we can absolutely go fine. In May 14, when we want to go clean this stuff up we can absolutely go right write a report and go find what these guys were up to and make sure we clean it all up

Speaker 1  26:40
good I think that's a good approach nothing that's urgent for right now. But it it's we'd use it once or twice to clean up things before we get to what we think is is you know what I was just describing at Larry suggested

Speaker 1  27:08
good so okay on AR then I will have go back to Whitney ever change that number so that takes care of the 4602 Now you said there's an AR discrepancy on ABC as well of negative 79 or 140 that was also an email last night was that similar situation where to clean something up in it

Matthias Miller  27:45
I almost saw through is one of these let me see if this is this one I should take a bit better notes sales

Unknown Speaker  27:54
number here if it's helpful I've got

Matthias Miller  27:56
it that's the one ending in 2415 right yes

Matthias Miller  28:19
I thought there was one of these where

Matthias Miller  28:30
it was a year can I transaction This is going into Israel we did

Matthias Miller  28:50
I see now that I avoided this one.

Speaker 1  28:55
Well, this one's strange because I'm looking at looking at the invoice and that yeah, the sales order shows a payment on 111. Of 70 90205 75 cents more.

Matthias Miller  29:18
As write off then for 65 cents but I voided was that on purpose. There are no associated transactions with this thing I've would have been more not sure why

Speaker 1  29:51
is that in? You're looking in AR not customer deposits.

Matthias Miller  29:58
There are no transactions that

Unknown Speaker  30:01
Oh no transactions at all

Matthias Miller  30:06
I'm not sure which one be Josh wait a minute this is not good

Matthias Miller  30:24
it was not supposed to avoid it we have transactions that got voided last night that weren't supposed to get weird

Unknown Speaker  31:00
transaction

Unknown Speaker  31:24
Oh

Matthias Miller  31:35
makes no sense

Matthias Miller  31:43
we get voided this wasn't last night it was on the second

Matthias Miller  31:55
the write off got voided Okay, let's take a look at this one this is modified on the second the second on the second on the second on the second so this one

Matthias Miller  32:32
there's a missing account on something here. Okay. Okay then what did we Why did people would change he added a write off for customer overpayment

Matthias Miller  32:53
this is this is new house a b c he doesn't have a mapping on his he added a customer overpayment but didn't add a mapping GL Account mapping and so this invoice the sales order got voided earlier this week or the accounting impact that we added earlier this week.

Speaker 1  33:23
So he created a write off but did not map it the write off is not mapped to a account correct so I can give you an account if you want to put it in or I guess what

Matthias Miller  33:38
we could do that I need to manually push this back in

Speaker 1  33:42
go ahead and others like that.

Matthias Miller  33:47
Is it 20 That 70 customer payments

Unknown Speaker  33:54
yeah

Matthias Miller  33:58
let's make sure that we don't have I'm sure it needs to happen to the other accounting company and the other companies as well probably does. Let's make sure that we get

Speaker 1  34:10
what has happened is something in one company and knows he needs to do it in the other companies but they're things come up and then that happened. So the so the write offs are are a global setting, but the like those ratios are those set. Those are also set for a company right for accounting company.

Matthias Miller  34:42
They are they're set globally. They're mapped on the accounting company. So but an ABC does ABC use green sky? Do they use art to premium

Speaker 1  35:06
we were going to, but we're, we're going to go away from that because already if we are to premium is actually a separate payment and you add it as a rate of positive right have, you cannot posit a ride off. So you try to beg for $2,000 from precut valet for five different buildings and you apply the right house, each individual building and then you go try and find those humans payments necessarily there. Right? Oh, so you can so that long story short that the thought was that we're going to take away that write off

Unknown Speaker  35:50
lately and when we get a R to premium will just those that are to print the entire check that revenue account instead of trying to tattoo a building.

Speaker 1  36:09
So if if RTO premiums, I know Drew is going to inactivate those so that they can't be used moving forward.

Matthias Miller  36:23
I don't think we ever gave them a way to deactivate them. That's I wonder if we should just only allow them if you want to do that. No, you can't unmapped. Yeah, we need to give you an ability to hear let me

Unknown Speaker  36:47
see.

Matthias Miller  36:52
Let's just do this allows the activating right off reasons. And a new right off or new renew active checkbox to write off reasons at a migration just set to true change the write off reason drop list in sales orders to filter by active only.

Matthias Miller  37:58
All right, so then I've added customer over payment to ABC, ABC and Showtime. And then let me as the follow up for this one. Search for all historical sales orders using this right off using overpayment write off and regenerate transactions for them. Okay, well, it is a little comforting that there wasn't just completely it's comforting that we didn't automatically avoid those, just say that.

Speaker 1  38:51
All right, and with that change that 79 or 140. We'll come back and the bat AR

Matthias Miller  39:02
will work and

Speaker 1  39:05
it looks like the only AR balance that's going to change is one for North Carolina.

Unknown Speaker  39:12
Correct.

Speaker 1  40:02
Good So no change on customer deposits that you that you saw

Matthias Miller  40:14
Yeah, I mean there's 123121055

Matthias Miller  40:28
Let's see who did this Vanessa added a an upgrade financing fee of 3164 which changed which reduced How is it which took the customer deposits from negative 63 or 6328 20 to 60 Sorry 60 to 9656

Speaker 1  41:05
I think that's where we hit seen how would that affect customer deposits

Matthias Miller  41:20
because okay an upgrade finance fee is a minus write off

Matthias Miller  41:34
because we had we got the total was 6328 20 but we only got 6296 56 So why were we underpaid?

Unknown Speaker  41:51
Stripe they keep back

Matthias Miller  41:56
exactly. So it looked like we were owing the customer 3164 But the real thing was there was a fee that was withheld

Unknown Speaker  42:09
when she

Unknown Speaker  42:18
for which company is that?

Matthias Miller  42:21
This one is ABC

Speaker 1  42:28
customer deposits I'm sure had been like 72,004 9541 and it's now what should the new number be

Matthias Miller  42:38
72,005 2705 72,005 7505 72,005 2705

Unknown Speaker  42:57
And that's probably what

Unknown Speaker  43:03
when did that happen? Because it's morning drew send a bail on the sheet of

Speaker 1  43:12
for ABC. Plus a deposit showed the original showed the 495 41 number that was probably bought this morning.

Matthias Miller  43:25
Well Hang on. Wait assuming the 14 Why was the discrepancy? I just remember this wasn't matching up with the deposit spreadsheet. This positive spreadsheet can be battled does the customer deposits Take That's why this customer deposits state write offs into account. It doesn't

Speaker 1  44:01
that's why on in the case of so we have a stripe if a customer makes $1,000 payment credit card payment does customer deposits show 1000 Or does it show 970

Matthias Miller  44:20
It will show it should show 1000 with the fee coming out of your stripe fees right

Unknown Speaker  44:36
no

Matthias Miller  44:40
that's not right. Stripe fees are different we don't use right ask for stripe fees.

Speaker 1  44:48
Through yeah that you're right. But how should it be for these for these? Okay, it's it's unusual that we have a costume deposit or from finance company Before the building is invoiced? Sure, but it does I mean, we still need to build for it. So if it does happen we want the deposit to show only the portion we get right?

Matthias Miller  45:26
Well, technically

Speaker 1  45:34
it can go both ways so they can do, they also do kickbacks, where we get more money than we ask, then we can have three different scenarios we customer wants to finance 5000 of their building. So if he has low credit score, we'll get 4950 and they keep 50. If as decent, we'll get the full 5000 Yeah, it's really good credit, then we'll get 5025 or something like that. So how should we think about customer deposits? There's an over one, one, there's a

Matthias Miller  46:20
Clickbank? Well, I don't, you don't really have control over what shows up in your customer deposit. If you want the kickback kickback or the fee to show up in the income or expense account.

Speaker 1  46:37
You're saying if we want it to show up in the income or expense account, we would show the full amount that we're getting the 4950 or the 5025 whatever is going to hit our bank, whatever is going to hit the bank account.

Matthias Miller  46:54
Now okay, if you look in the example of the sales order I mentioned, the customer deposit is the invoice total.

Matthias Miller  47:09
The the counterpart of that is most of that goes so that'd be 6328 2060 to 9656 of that comes from undeposited funds, and 3164 that comes from the finance fees expense account. But if you want them to balance out then an underpayment you would have to show the customer deposits would have to show what we actually got plus the fee. In the case of an overpayment or a kickback, the deposit would show I think you would see customer deposits with the balance of your example but $5,000 bank account would show $5,025 increase, and the revenue account for your kickbacks would show a $25 increase.

Speaker 1  48:25
But then, what would it show? If there's a fee? Would it show with customer deposits show the full 5000 Or would it show 4950

Matthias Miller  48:34
Putting in 50

Speaker 1  48:40
Oh, okay, I got so you're saying customer deposits needs to show what hits her bank?

Matthias Miller  48:46
No, I'm sorry. I was wrong. customer deposits would so 5000 bank would increase by 4950. These would increase by $50 and everything balances out

Speaker 1  49:06
but why would you show if there's a kickback Why would you show 5025 When you do the same go 5000.

Matthias Miller  49:21
Well okay, if you so five we got 5000 in cash, you can attribute that $5,000 To deposit then you have $25 of revenue what is the corresponding account for that revenue?

Matthias Miller  49:51
With your bank So your question was when we get a kickback Why does the deposit nut so? customer deposits? Can you ask your question again?

Unknown Speaker  50:09
Yeah, my question was, if we have a kickback Why does customer deposits not show the same amount that hits our bank if you 2550 25

Matthias Miller  50:24
Because Because if we want it to reflect in a kickback revenue account, we need somewhere to Well, I mean, if you were to move your kickback to be dated the date of the sale

Matthias Miller  50:59
the kickback is tied to the payment which is also not completely correct.

Matthias Miller  51:25
So you have a 5000 tweet, okay, on this sales order, you would put it into payment of $5,025. But the only balance that should be applied to your sales order should be $5,000. You need to account for the $25 difference, you put that under under the kickback category, right off reason that goes into your kickback revenue. And the reason the reason you don't see the full amount. So if if you wanted to let's, let's say that you wait to add the kickback until the invoice date. And then in that case, you would have the transaction you would have $5,025 that shows up as a deposit. And then when you invoice it, you would apply $5,000 to accounts receivable and $25 to kick back revenue account.

Speaker 1  52:41
Yeah, and if you there's no way if apply everything ahead of time, couldn't it just sit in the 5025 sit in customer deposits until it's invoice and then 5000. But against AR and the 25? was to have a new account?

Matthias Miller  53:15
Yeah, so basically what we're saying is, we should change write offs. To not, if you have a write off that's dated before the invoice date, we should wait to apply it until the date of the invoice, right.

Speaker 1  53:39
I was thinking Couldn't we just drag them correctly all the way through like the Undo okay, if we start with undeposited funds undeposited funds

Speaker 1  54:01
I almost feel like we should, you should I should be quiet and you should write up a proposal on an example and a proposal on how this should work and then we regroup on this I feel like I'm just

Unknown Speaker  54:15
muddying the waters because the other question that comes to my mind is what happens when a customer says I'm going to pay 3000 with a check and 5000 with

Speaker 1  54:36
financing company. Like do we record a payment is your payment recorded of 5000 then the sales or

Matthias Miller  54:50
if the currently if you execute the I don't know. Okay, here's here's another question. Here's a business question to flip it back to you, when you get a kickback when do you want that revenue recognized? And when you incur a fee when or an undercharge when do you want that recognized? And I wonder if this could be as simple as on the write off reason be able to specify whether this gets applied at the basically a a Can you specify a date or does this always execute on the invoicing date if it exists

Unknown Speaker  55:42
I think it should always be on the invoice date but that brings us to

Speaker 1  55:57
Okay, on the cog section it that's that's the whole idea behind accrual based accounting is your revenue and your cogs are what happened that month or that quarter your expenses or they have nothing your revenue your cogs your gross profit should reflect what happened in that month it shouldn't go up or down if you build a lot more inventory in one month it should always reflect what was what your sales were what was invoiced but your operating expenses below that be flaked you paid that reflect on services that you what you paid that almost what you paid that those shouldn't get bigger those operating expenses won't change a lot with rise and fall of sales whereas the top part will the operating expense or the revenue the cogs so

Unknown Speaker  57:23
the expenses were making this too complicated that maybe we try to do that maybe we should just

Speaker 1  57:38
well no I mean it is helpful to know for a period of time how much did stripe cost us why should we pay in stripe fees how much did we pay in in sky fees how much did we pay and

Speaker 1  58:00
I almost feel like what we have now encourages these to be recorded as they're in bird bags no we're we've changed our mind on RTO premiums as well. I think we should do anything with finance kickbacks because RTO premiums we said the other hole in our theory of tying those to the sales order is make a sale by the time we look at revenue for January looking forward if we review our income statements 15th of the following month we look at what happened we see our revenue schedule on RTO premiums being paid most likely those are to premiums for those buildings listed as revenue won't even be ordered yet because we don't have funds to accompany because that's so we said well okay let's keep it simple and let's just and put them into that account as they come in. Thank you think we should think about about finances

Matthias Miller  59:46
I think the other thing, I mean even with other write offs like you won't know for you might not know for 90 days whether you're going to be able to collect the last $15 At the end customer didn't or whatever or even even even just with lead times you might not get it delivered in like less than the sale would be executed them but there's a time delay on that

Unknown Speaker  1:00:25
so, I don't know does that give you something to work off off or is there stuff I need to business processes we already have answers on.

Matthias Miller  1:00:40
What would be helpful for you what would be helpful for you is to know how do how do underpayments overpayments and underpayments overpayments work as far as write offs are concerned? That right?

Speaker 1  1:01:03
Yeah, it would be helpful to know now is under the current system how to write elves. They're under or over payments function. They show up in customer deposits, do they show up in undeposited funds? How do they affect AR? And then the timing do they accounting transaction happen as of the date of write off, like what write off is typically dated to a payment date, right?

Matthias Miller  1:01:45
Write off is tied to a specific payment defaults to the payment date, but it can be adjusted. So one big question would be does it follow the deposit versus AR I need to confirm I think that if a write off is made prior to invoicing it adjust the deposit account believe if it happens after and adjust the AR account. Now there's a very small chance that I don't think it's true, there's a very small chance that it would adjust just based on the payment date. If you ever write off on a payment that was made prior to invoicing that it would adjust customer deposits but I don't think that's actually the way it works but I can I can check

Unknown Speaker  1:02:40
I think that was it I think

Matthias Miller  1:02:44
Yeah. Let me do that sorry

Matthias Miller  1:02:54
so this is how do write offs work

Speaker 1  1:03:08
okay, so going back to to the the question on the 79 so the only place where we have AR shifting is is that North Carolina we already talked about right

Matthias Miller  1:03:24
yes, but we also have a new issue now with through adding some write offs and voiding some transactions that we need to be able to bring back in order to tie out numbers Okay, so what's

Unknown Speaker  1:03:41
the path forward on that

Matthias Miller  1:03:45
I need to go back man I don't think there's much to do besides me. I can go back and find which sales orders I any sales orders any historical sales orders with that write off and that should be included in either customer deposits or AR and if they should bring them back and increase accounting transactions for them

Unknown Speaker  1:04:20
Okay, so with that then I'm wondering if it seems like it would be helpful if after you've done that you provide but Drew and I would here's here's where you're at with balances on for each of the companies on AR and customer deposits.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:47
And then also I could just be like, I don't know and just Elara

Speaker 1  1:04:54
those six values and then also a Are the two AR report and customer deposits report again, just, I just want to have once we have that those numbers accurate, I just want to have some documentation on file so we can back up the numbers that we use for 23.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:30
Does that sound reasonable? doable?

Matthias Miller  1:05:35
Yep, it does. I I am cautiously optimistic that I'll be able to get that stuff or I'll be able to get that done by over to you in time for a new morning. So you guys can take a look at that.

Speaker 1  1:05:57
That sounds good. Anything else that that for me?

Matthias Miller  1:06:04
Yeah, I guess last question would be if I've got Monday blacked out to just let me know, if you want to meet up if you think we're gonna want to meet up on Monday, I'm going to project I need to focus on next week with a deadline. And so I need to either either focus on it on Monday or Wednesday, so I can, if I know beforehand that you're gonna want to talk on Monday, I might move ahead maybe to Wednesday, but if not, get that out of the way. So

Speaker 1  1:06:39
Oh, I almost feel like it, there would be enough value in doing it Monday. I don't know. If that doesn't make too much of a rush into your plans. It would be I think it'd be helpful to just once you have those numbers, we just refer and make that. Like we know now that we're pretty sure that these numbers aren't going to shift anymore. And then that's those are the numbers we use and we

Matthias Miller  1:07:13
are with those. Okay, well let's plan on maybe tentatively plan on meeting around nine o'clock Monday morning. That would be that'd be workable for me if that's workable for you and we can assuming I can get all that stuff over to you. That gives you guys a little bit of time to look over it and I can we can review is that good? Or would you rather have it?

Unknown Speaker  1:07:43
That's really good. That's good.

Matthias Miller  1:07:48
Okay, awesome.

Speaker 1  1:07:51
I'll know that sounds good. And have a good weekend. We'll talk Monday.

Matthias Miller  1:08:01
All right. I will you have a good one as well.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:04
Okay, thank you.
