I don't think that it's, it's it's possible to really understand what makes a person tech until you understand, yes, you need to understand their personality, but you also need to understand their story and how they got there. And a lot of us, you know the limitations of personality assessments is that it's simply outputting the data that you give it. And so if you've got certain behaviors that are or patterns that you develop in response to certain situations in the past, you may appear to have a certain type of personality or certain type of interest, but when we when we paired that with your story, where you come from, the experiences you've had, the the door, slamming doors, slamming your face, the whatever it has, I think you have to take an honest look inside and understand, lean into the the the more difficult parts of your of your journey, and you have to walk through and sift through those pieces to really be able to discern whether this is just like, Is this really me, or is this just, is this just a response to what happened to me? I.
