Unknown Speaker  10:12
Hey, hey, hey, sorry, I

Matthias Miller  10:15
just got distracted almost. And I was like puppet Jonathan's in the waiting room. That's fine.

Unknown Speaker  10:23
So, how have you been?

Speaker 1  10:27
Good. So I had a great week last week and play music for my church by the Easter concert. And so I'm really tired for the first few days this week, because it takes a lot of energy but feeling great today.

Unknown Speaker  10:46
Right, yeah. Yeah, I have hit a groove.

Matthias Miller  10:54
Well, the last last few days, I feel like it's been a death by 1000 paper cuts, or not just a bajillion things going on. So

Unknown Speaker  11:08
big bad things are just much a little busy work things.

Matthias Miller  11:10
It's busy work things. And that's the thing that's frustrating about it. Yeah, I hear you. And I mean, some of it's good I hired hired an assistant on Wednesday. So she's so carving, trying to carve out time to get her on boarded on tasks, and start working through about 400 emails that are in my inbox that need to be dealt with in some form or fashion. Now, there's a bunch of useless nonsense, but

Unknown Speaker  11:39
and just, I don't know.

Matthias Miller  11:44
client decides they want to get a roll out of 2d visualizer on the website, or 3d visualized on the website.

Unknown Speaker  11:52
And it's just lots of little things. I hate big things. So yeah,

Speaker 1  12:03
that's everything else family good. Things good. And other other stuff.

Matthias Miller  12:07
It was good

Speaker 2  12:08
businesses good. Yeah, you're gonna be record.

Speaker 1  12:19
Okay, so here goes my I've told you before, I must be analytical, and then I get creative, like totally spontaneously and off the cuff. So so here we go with one of those. So literally watching this guy, scroll this guy, I'm assuming it occurs to me that what is happening, can I grab this widget? What is happening right here is literally the impact of the photography, right? Like this is the case where the photos on this page are going to actually make a difference. And I am not saying that this is wrong or bad for all I know, there's the old classic ugly cells and all that, but it has crossed my mind a few times that almost all these images were taken on a cloudy day. And to most people, as far as I know, cloudy days are not attractive. Pros and cons. On the other hand, the contrast is not you know, there's not like deep shadows because there's no bright sunlight. Does that make sense? So might be good. And I don't even know how he would split test that I didn't know if it's worth a split test. But it just it's crossed my mind a few times that I think these photos could be a little more appetizing. And I wonder if they I think the real point here and I am talking about the screen we're looking at here I think the real point is trying to showcase this shape function styling of the different models right the different styles and I just wonder if that comes across sufficiently because like for example, the angles were not consistent this one straight on this one's tilted this one's a different till right so like whatever I'm kind of just rambling but I just it crosses my mind that there's a lack of consistency probably not as pretty as it could be and I just wonder if it couldn't be improved? I mean like here let me just go nuts for a second let's do

Unknown Speaker  14:13
it wow yeah

Speaker 1  14:20
well for that matter already remember Perry talks on and on about origins about 100 miles north of here. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  14:25
he he did an email intro with Eugene.

Unknown Speaker  14:29
See we can talk next week. Oh neat.

Speaker 1  14:35
Let's just look real quick at a handful these and see what kind of photos as none of those I realized that I've already gone off on a bunny trail. Stop me if you want to. These are these are at least consistent in Oh allowance slider. These are at least consistent and that they mostly use an angled view and as you can get the end and the face.

Unknown Speaker  14:58
Yeah, gather

Unknown Speaker  15:06
So you're saying you're going to talk to Eugene?

Unknown Speaker  15:09
Yeah, that's a side note of a new that I've heard

Matthias Miller  15:19
so slides from people who've worked for them so I don't really know where the conversations gonna go but

Unknown Speaker  15:24
yeah, I'm circumcision good monster

Speaker 1  15:32
if someone just like really quickly stuck this in front of me and then stuck this in front of me I would just off the cuff say I like these better.

Unknown Speaker  15:43
bigger, brighter better sunny day. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  15:47
sorry I actually meant to can trust to

Unknown Speaker  15:50
trigger Sun several shades unlimited zoom chat, I get no the tab to the right. Oh, sorry. I'm interested in these guys because they kind of know

Speaker 1  16:04
you know, I liked it. This would be worth testing, like does a diagram convey the point better than a photo? To give you a tooltip photo you do the diagram and then when they put their mouse over it, you could have a tooltip photo.

Matthias Miller  16:18
Or like just have the text appear when they when they hover? Right? Not like a little tooltip Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  16:25
This side is very clean and orderly. I

Unknown Speaker  16:27
like it. And look at these these are like elegant but they're all Clunes like mostly the same angle

Speaker 1  16:40
Mm hmm. The settings are good light bulbs on horse in the barn flowers on the garage or whatever that is many barns I like it I like this a lot. Be really curious to emulate this

Speaker 1  16:59
this is chaos but then again this might be a classic case of ugly cells.

Matthias Miller  17:05
This is like the I mean this is the classic

Unknown Speaker  17:12
agile here from the 90s it was

Unknown Speaker  17:14
exactly

Matthias Miller  17:17
like the the pictorial classified mailer type of feel. Yep, totally

Speaker 2  17:28
now that scroll up look at that. We have something almost like this

Speaker 1  17:35
we got a little bit of a little time delay. You're looking at the sheds by size section. Yeah, yeah.

Matthias Miller  17:40
The the 3d modeling of that.

Unknown Speaker  17:44
That is killer. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  17:51
If we could have something like this here let me

Unknown Speaker  17:57
Dwayne

Speaker 1  18:02
Give me one second time Kathleen. Is something wrong okay, well just shut it off. It's not that big a problem Sorry, kid management understand we're starting to see that Dwayne and modeling Oh, I'm

Unknown Speaker  18:23
just going to shoot it over to him

Matthias Miller  18:24
because we've had conversations about floor plans but floor plans to me just look like it's just confusing but if you could see okay, here's it here it is with two boats side by side and a car parked on the other end like

Unknown Speaker  18:35
well that's helpful I know Yeah. Needs to be oh yeah

Unknown Speaker  18:53
there they do the popular filters

Unknown Speaker  18:56
This is a search I wish

Unknown Speaker  18:59
I try this different

Unknown Speaker  19:06
sure

Unknown Speaker  19:22
maybe they don't got a morning. Okay. I like Home Depot's a lot better

Unknown Speaker  19:35
it's much more than Amazon type of feel. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  19:48
Okay,

Unknown Speaker  19:48
we're gonna go back to the recordings. Are you

Unknown Speaker  20:11
actually looking at the product detail

Unknown Speaker  20:18
that's worth knowing. By the way, is there any way we can capture these recordings in timeout to pageviews per sessions? Sorry,

Speaker 1  20:32
the last half of that was and tie them to page recessions. Well, what does that mean?

Matthias Miller  20:35
Like? I mean, like, is there a way to say find a recording from when they were on this specific URL URL with this, you know, query

Unknown Speaker  20:43
string or something? I'm not sure.

Speaker 1  20:47
I mean, it does show the entry point and the timestamp for sure. Does that help? I don't think it's actually

Unknown Speaker  20:58
now that's literally a list of what they did when they viewed so if they would have gone to the thank you page. We could anyway, this is how do you want to

Unknown Speaker  21:20
see only ones that filled out the form?

Matthias Miller  21:24
Why don't know it? No, because we're wanting to find out why people drop off. I don't think we do but Sorry, my brains just go to like, here's one. Thank you free quote. ID equals Oh, that's something else. No, that was that's not a real anyway.

Unknown Speaker  21:40
Yep. You can go back but

Speaker 1  21:49
Okay, so for sure we can if you're curious, like which page they left from, and oh, you know, we're opening

Unknown Speaker  21:59
14 That one right there. This one right here wow,

Speaker 1  22:07
that's weird. They can't have the landing page, the landing page and they came back to it. Maybe I was gonna say there's something wrong with the setup. We're losing them when they hit the type form because Hotjar is not operating on the type form that can be fixed we can we can plug that in. I've done it before. So we can plug the code for this hot jar into tight form and get it all the way through to the end so my I'm thinking that none of these are all the way through to the end because they all break as soon as they try to navigate to the type form page

Unknown Speaker  22:42
okay

Matthias Miller  22:51
yeah and then at the point that we do that we could we're getting ready to we'll talk about this later but make some changes to the opt in stuff but anyway

Unknown Speaker  23:02
you're going to really take a look at this stuff

Unknown Speaker  23:15
on a mobile phone no less yeah I'm going to skip a little bit

Unknown Speaker  23:30
they went back to the models

Unknown Speaker  23:47
Todd Campbell

Unknown Speaker  23:53
once you turn on ever seen this the indicating they went back page

Unknown Speaker  23:58
I guess it's funny.

Speaker 2  24:31
Now they are really into it. If I was to spend 1315 minutes on this on their phone, that's an it's incredible.

Speaker 2  24:48
I can't think about this either. With my tracking code, I could tie out highly engaged visitors

Unknown Speaker  25:05
We left

Speaker 1  25:07
so can you back one tiny bit see here pause Yeah, so then they click the menu I don't know they left they could have just as easily click they may have gladly could have just clicked that and then we lost them.

Unknown Speaker  25:21
That's true too okay,

Speaker 1  25:25
do you want to see that and I wonder what was their info on? Are they from they are from the United States they guess they're saying oh Facebook browser so they were actually on Facebook I clicked it and the somehow the thing opened on it that's from a Facebook ad for sure. And so they actually did all that inside the little pop in browser that opens in your Facebook mobile app.

Unknown Speaker  25:53
Neat. Okay, interesting

Unknown Speaker  26:02
cool.

Unknown Speaker  26:05
Okay, want to see more that are?

Matthias Miller  26:08
Well, I mean, I don't know like how do we how do we know utilize this information to figure out what the what the drop off is?

Unknown Speaker  26:17
Where we're losing them

Speaker 1  26:18
so drop offs and as far as so a couple things I think a human has to actually go through here and watch the tail end of a bunch of recordings and it's literally see what they do last

Unknown Speaker  26:32
five minutes look at that one

Unknown Speaker  26:39
Oh, it's a lot of activity the the left and came back see what they did last anyway. They were looking at a specific shed. I scroll to the bottom I wonder why

Speaker 1  26:53
there is an unfortunate possibility that some of these could be bots or this surely not well well. There's really not all bots but Okay, so let me show you something else and maybe if we're if we're really looking for drop offs, we should probably a be looking at all the took this away GUI so used to be able to define a funnel which is literally like people start here and they move through these particular pages to get to the end of the funnel and then helps him helps identify the drop off pages themselves that used to be free and how much they cost and service

Unknown Speaker  27:42
for events there's recessions I suppose

Unknown Speaker  28:01
that's kind of

Speaker 1  28:01
a competitor tool. It's very substantially similar. I think the main difference was the pricing although it's

Speaker 2  28:18
what he thought was a paid us it'd be 60 storage. So I like

Unknown Speaker  28:23
to get started with something like this

Unknown Speaker  28:27
just an idea that's Yeah sanity lucky orange.com I'll put it in here

Unknown Speaker  28:42
and got into Google lockouts good place yep. Okay

Unknown Speaker  28:54
The other thing that I didn't think about was sessions your media planning report I can't remember what all information I have on this

Speaker 2  29:27
the host the URL in there as well. I would import I've got all this stuff is stashed away in s3 but I would import the page from the visitor logs. We could then identify

Unknown Speaker  29:56
we could then look for

Speaker 2  30:03
Various I don't know patterns to see if there's patterns just from the robbers or logs

Unknown Speaker  30:10
okay

Unknown Speaker  30:20
should go ahead and add that field down that would be a

Unknown Speaker  30:52
SID

Unknown Speaker  31:09
ws page view

Unknown Speaker  31:31
okay

Unknown Speaker  31:41
good

Unknown Speaker  31:51
and then something else here let's do we do this

Matthias Miller  31:58
it's at least highlighted and then we could also just

Unknown Speaker  32:35
I don't know that I've got more on that you do? Nope let's go to projected

Matthias Miller  32:45
numbers for May that's like the terrible thing. Let's get that one out of the way.

Speaker 2  32:50
Okay. So they are happy with 51 leads a week. But I noticed and

Speaker 1  33:00
just to be real clear they is everybody Indiana, North Carolina and the Indiana.

Matthias Miller  33:05
Indiana is ready to taper off.

Speaker 2  33:08
Okay. And so, but I noticed that there was almost a 50% increase in CPAs for Google last week

Speaker 1  33:23
that seems to be just seconds

Unknown Speaker  33:49
two point he

Speaker 1  33:50
has been talking about Google, Indiana. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  33:53
Okay. So wait a minute

Unknown Speaker  34:02
that's strange. I have no idea why the chart is halfway through the bottom. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  34:07
so

Speaker 1  34:09
of course it's a partial month we haven't gotten through a whole month cycle i Are you talking about this right here. Like this right here for

Matthias Miller  34:17
more specifically the last, more specifically the date range from and I know these things spike, but more specifically the date range from April 2 April 8.

Unknown Speaker  35:12
version rate

Speaker 1  35:13
went down 22 percents interesting. Let me see if I can identify where that happened

Unknown Speaker  35:47
was the last time we made a change to the funnel again

Speaker 2  36:03
can tell me we rolled out okay there's last week

Unknown Speaker  36:15
and what was the change last week

Matthias Miller  36:17
so we switched to a slightly different type form started asking people to specify choose a specific building and we started asking them about budget versus price and appearance and the type form and we modified the thank you page as well. But we could take a look at the type form and we can compare drop off rates of type form a versus type form B

Speaker 1  36:38
let's do that please and I'm not at all trying to say that is the type form I just want to explore that

Matthias Miller  36:49
I'm not wanting to say either that it is unless it is

Unknown Speaker  36:53
okay let me just try this here.

Unknown Speaker  36:56
It's too small

Unknown Speaker  37:10
completion rate is down about 8%

Unknown Speaker  37:23
Let me

Unknown Speaker  37:30
you want me to tinker with the screen recording just show you most important slightly bigger drop off we're seeing a 3% drop off here. Roof styles 3% 2% 2% 4% configuration is a big drop off is 4%

Unknown Speaker  38:06
That's the big one right there.

Unknown Speaker  38:08
Wow this one here is a big killer 18%

Speaker 1  38:15
Want To Work budget did it on our say

Unknown Speaker  38:20
September that we're only showing a single item what does that mean? When we were just showing a single option we're just showing showing them one specific option in that case looks like a

Unknown Speaker  38:41
bad question that needs to be zapped somehow

Unknown Speaker  38:50
oh wait

Unknown Speaker  38:51
a minute. So that's a fork what causes the fork

Unknown Speaker  38:56
what's most important to you okay

Unknown Speaker  39:11
not unless they feel like there's a loss of control the actual quote we were going to also they wanted to reintroduce the top selling size.

Matthias Miller  39:33
I wanted to throw that question in because it makes it a lot easier from a technical standpoint on the back end with what I'm doing on the thank you page but

Unknown Speaker  39:39
yeah

Unknown Speaker  39:45
but then the rest of these when people pick the style we're seeing drop off

Matthias Miller  39:55
rate, you know, I mean, it's not a lot of people coming down to the style

Unknown Speaker  40:00
When they do

Unknown Speaker  40:06
this to me like the fork is

Speaker 1  40:10
hard for me to process mentally but we can you go back down down to the bottom there's a pretty big drop on all the ones at the end there on the old side ended with nine 814 716 three and 12 and now it's

Unknown Speaker  40:29
like 12

Speaker 1  40:33
a 12 518 1014 I guess it's not a huge difference

Unknown Speaker  40:37
18%

Speaker 1  40:42
The 18% is bigger than any amount we've had

Unknown Speaker  40:45
before it could be we're just straight up asking them too many questions. I

Speaker 1  40:52
think we are the you know, I went to Ryan the Vex asked method for a while and he said benchmark metrics on a quiz and I know a quiz is not a calculator but there's some overlap you should lose I can go find the benchmarks but basically expect to lose a lot of people at the beginning and a lot of people at the end which you should not lose more than a few percent off of any particular question in the middle and if it is basically considered a

Unknown Speaker  41:26
bad question killing your own conversion rates well this is clearly bad you know these are actually let's do this go into here let's go into the design

Speaker 2  41:52
so budget friendly than we had painted

Speaker 2  42:03
that one last folks a lot. Animal Shelter sound lost a lot of folks.

Speaker 1  42:40
What has happened to make sure that makes you want to find a shed today? I would like to suggest that the right place for that question is on the thank you page after we've captured the lead. It is a it is a great research question but it is not necessary for lead capture and it's hurting us pretty bad there. You lost 50 People over that 40

Unknown Speaker  43:04
But okay, 35 Three.

Speaker 1  43:09
Yeah, I think we should ditch that. I love the question. I don't mean ditches and by distinguished you take it out of here and put it as a follow up on this

Unknown Speaker  43:20
on the

Unknown Speaker  43:21
Typeform thank you page to the final thank you page

Unknown Speaker  43:36
Do people just

Matthias Miller  43:36
feel like they're committing money because okay, this is double digit percentage. Premium steel barn. That one's easy. Let's take a look at this one.

Unknown Speaker  43:45
Premium. Well, that's okay. Premium steel

Matthias Miller  43:52
barn. There's one option there. We're not losing people on that.

Speaker 1  43:57
Which means, hey, wait, wait, wait, hold on for me. So 20 people, and all that one made it through meaning they were fine. But in a certain sense. It's just another annoying click. And they didn't actually decide anything there. Is that what you wanted?

Unknown Speaker  44:13
Well, I don't know. Well, I

Matthias Miller  44:14
mean, that's the only building that matches the criteria that they selected. But why then on the budget friendly, we give them the Mercer,

Unknown Speaker  44:20
the Mercer's the wrong color. So

Speaker 1  44:26
we are literally asking the million dollar question here that nobody has the answer to but I have two guesses. One, the picture is ugly. And it's not what they had in mind to the word budget friendly. You ever seen that deal where you know think of it think of a classic internet marketing classic squeeze page with nothing but an email box and for a while a lot of marketers started putting in tiny little fine print under the email box like you know, we will never spam me. You know what I'm saying? And then a while later some But he figured out that putting we'll never spam me was actually making things worse, instead of better because it was bringing up spam, whereas they weren't thinking about it until they read the disclaimer. And then they're like, oh, wait a minute spam, nevermind, I'm not going to enter my email address. And so I just wonder if an effect like that is taking place here where like, we're emphasizing budget friendly, so hard that it's triggering something. And they're like, man, nevermind, I don't want to budget friendly building you know what I'm saying? What was it? Can I see the question that causes the fork again?

Unknown Speaker  45:34
Price budget and purchase price and quality appearance maintenance free

Unknown Speaker  45:42
Why don't we have speed of delivery and there's a third option

Unknown Speaker  45:52
that's a great idea.

Speaker 1  45:54
Isn't that the old classic triangle you can have good service good price and what is it quality? Yeah, quality price or screen you can have any to quality price or speed which can't have all three it's old classic. Salesman saying Right? It is here I am making work and adding complexity instead of removing it so that's probably not a good idea. But it might be humorous to do that. See what happens.

Speaker 2  46:19
But it's got to be one of two things. budget friendly Okay, here's the thing though. Our budget buildings are

Matthias Miller  46:35
are higher quality than premium Home Depot

Unknown Speaker  46:37
buildings? Yes. And that's really good.

Speaker 1  46:44
But they don't know that yet. Perhaps you know, I'm saying like having clicked an ad gotten here and on a screen we know they're good, but they don't know they're good. So. Okay, kit does tight form allow for split tests literally like AB variations of a single question. I don't know.

Unknown Speaker  47:22
Well, it's autopilots and

Unknown Speaker  47:24
integration. Yeah.

Speaker 2  47:26
I don't think they do natively. I mean, what we could do is we could add

Unknown Speaker  47:39
another question and change the flow to bypass this one and just the other one and we can compare them

Unknown Speaker  47:51
click on

Speaker 1  47:58
would you mind going through the widgets for me? So up there in the far upper right of the screen way far upper? Right. Yeah, what what's under logic and what's under that gear?

Unknown Speaker  48:06
Okay, that's logic for the whole tree. Everything so design your design. Now that totally design

Speaker 1  48:24
Okay, forget that. Okay, so that idea, nevermind. Well scroll down that pain. So layout focal point, right. Unnecessary. Anything further down.

Unknown Speaker  48:35
All tags keep going. At the bottom too.

Speaker 1  48:38
Too bad. I just wish I had a navy option in here. Okay, well, I a couple of things. So. Yeah, let me take a step back from it, if you don't mind. So I have observed that CPA actually, I wish I could show you but in a nutshell. If we look at the CPA graphs that have multiple months in them, CPA went down in January and February came back up a little in March and then is back up a good chunk in April. And two things I actually don't know for sure why it went down in February like I don't know why it was that good. And so it's kind of like we had a good month, and then we're back to normal more than it's like we had a normal month and also everything's gone bad. Does that make any sense at all? And then, so I can't account for the good, we're kind of back to normal. But I do think I think we're we might be having two or three things going on, or four simultaneously. So one, I think this did lower conversion rates to the lowering conversion rates might be confusing the algorithm because like everything was converting behaving a certain way, Facebook or Google goes to fetch a new converter and oops for some reason, this person that they thought was going to convert based on a years where the past data doesn't convert Now the algorithm was like, oh, what's up with that? So we might actually be shooting ourselves in the foot a little bit there. And then further combined with I don't know, seasonality or more some, some other thing. I don't think that we we are okay, then here's the fourth one. We are raising those budgets. So it's possible that we're getting some, like extra trash in or whatever, that we haven't been able to filter out yet. But I don't think I know for sure we have not changed ads, targeting keywords, etc. So much that we've shaken up the system with something like that. I know for sure that did not happen. And so I don't think that just raising the budgets alone. Well, yeah, it could, it could be that raising the budgets alone causes problems. It just feels a little doubtful to me. I think it's an intersection of the three and so

Unknown Speaker  50:53
this Yeah, go ahead. No, no,

Matthias Miller  50:57
no, keep going. Yeah, I

Speaker 1  50:58
was I was just gonna say that my gut reaction to that is let's try to put Typeform back whether that means put the old one back or it means try to patch up the new one to get it closer to the previous conversion rates. Either one let's give it a shot. And my preferred way of doing that if we're going to modify the current one is let's pull out that one question that I pointed out that cost us 35 visitors and I think go on the thank you page. And then and then let's see we can do something about how we're losing people on this budget friendly question.

Speaker 2  51:31
It looks let's go to a logic and let's just straight up your zip code what caused you so this one should go to what's your zip code

Unknown Speaker  52:02
so this one will be stranded and then let's go to back to design and let's duplicate this guy and

Speaker 1  52:40
they only get here if they click price on the previous button. Correct. And I would think that part of the frustration here is that there's only one option it's almost like being told oh, you click the price button you only get one choice

Unknown Speaker  52:59
right The problem is I don't have any more pictures of a budget building that's the frustrating thing.

Speaker 1  53:14
I mean, just for the sake of the A B test can you put your next two I don't know what caused you to pick the Mercer but can we just add two more in there the next two lowest priced ones

Matthias Miller  53:26
let me see if I can find where my report for this.

Unknown Speaker  54:09
Worse whatever you've been needing need to make sure this thing is actually doing what I think it is

Unknown Speaker  54:32
no one was completely useless Okay,

Matthias Miller  54:35
bye.

Unknown Speaker  54:40
Okay, so

Unknown Speaker  54:47
we

Unknown Speaker  54:57
Okay, let's watch

Unknown Speaker  55:06
Oh it's this one alright so the Ashton don't know that we're selling the Aston here sells very

Unknown Speaker  55:29
most of these are pre configured into

Unknown Speaker  55:53
we do the

Unknown Speaker  56:01
Make sure that's available in Indiana

Unknown Speaker  56:23
Okay, now let's see pics today

Unknown Speaker  56:43
do you want that one on there

Speaker 1  56:49
not the most appetizing image. But I am saying that I really think we need a choice on there. So if that's all we got to work with ensure,

Matthias Miller  56:59
see what other options we get. We get the Ashen immersion

Unknown Speaker  57:01
cells very see if we got the cells very.

Unknown Speaker  57:19
Very wesbury. So sounds very doesn't exist. And by then we're getting into the

Unknown Speaker  57:37
I mean, that's the only thing.

Matthias Miller  57:41
Anything above that we're starting to get into

Unknown Speaker  57:43
six screen buildings. So okay,

Speaker 1  57:49
so let's take a step back. So what problem are we trying to solve? With the question about price? And what does the business as a whole thinks they're going to offer the people I am essentially asking.

Speaker 2  58:08
Do we have a product problem? So, okay,

Matthias Miller  58:13
allow me to rant for a little bit, this might turn into another conversation. Great. The Shed industry as a whole is commoditized. Yes. How many sheds? Can you crank out for as little money as possible and not tell people that it's 18 inches on center studs, not 16? Or whatever they

Unknown Speaker  58:31
do? Yep.

Matthias Miller  58:33
And don't talk about like, just just keep your mouth shut.

Unknown Speaker  58:40
That's the market.

Matthias Miller  58:41
There is 20% of the market? Well, we see the numbers here. 30% of our people are saying we're not looking for price. We're looking for quality. Yeah. And and it's possible that the quality of leads in the grand scheme of things or conversion rates and CPAs are up. But the problem we're trying to solve here is how do we find that niche market? Who are cash buyers? Well, cash buyers or what I think a lot of these are straight up going to be cash buyers. That's what I think, from what I've been seeing, but cash buyers who want the real deal, and they want something they can be proud of.

Speaker 1  59:24
So this ties into a related question. I pointed this out last year, it is possible there's the best ROI and the best sales come from the higher CPA leads and if what you so imagine this Oh, and I'm not saying this is what happened. I'm saying it could have imagined that you created a new type form. The new type form ingeniously filtered out the price people which caused the apparent CPA to go up but it's an apparent CPA on a whole better quality buyer and we're no longer even fiddling, playing With the tire kicking price priority buyers that you guys didn't want to talk to you in the first place anyway. Yep. Does that make sense? It does make sense? And if so, from a business perspective, it's acceptable and even good that the CPA went up. It's just I don't know how we would prove that.

Matthias Miller  1:00:19
Well, we can't really until we get offline conversions in place.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:25
I think I mean,

Matthias Miller  1:00:29
so there's this whole other issue. I mean, we lose people to price objections all the time, and some of it is bad salesmanship. And some of them is like, Jonathan, how are you supposed to hire these folks posted by shit if they can't afford more than $200 a month payment? Or how can they afford a fourth? 4000? Much less a? Eight to 10k if depending what they're looking at, like it's not possible. Yeah.

Speaker 2  1:00:56
And so I'm inclined to go back to this question here. Remove this guy.

Matthias Miller  1:01:08
Keep this in place for now publish these changes. Tell me Stop me if I shouldn't.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:14
I don't think we're good.

Matthias Miller  1:01:18
And say, Well, we think it's a higher quality lead, but we can't tell for sure. And I know this is a little bit of kind of pushing them in a direction that they've been scared to go.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:30
So maybe this is okay.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:50
Okay,

Matthias Miller  1:01:53
also does not explain why Google numbers are so dramatic, so much, dramatically higher in Indiana than North Carolina and every time I look at these numbers, I'm like, why is this but I don't know that we've ever come to a good answer. Every time I'm talking to them. I'm like, There's got to be an answer every time talking to you. I'm like, well, maybe there's not really

Unknown Speaker  1:02:09
a good answer.

Speaker 1  1:02:12
And just to be clear, it's it's dramatically higher proportionately for both Facebook and Google so both of them are higher in Indiana. And no, I don't have an answer. And yes, it drives me nuts. It's just like everything just costs more in Indiana. I've seen this happen in the real world like I worked with roofers like we've had this conversation a while back and Florida and New Jersey had a great CPL and I'm literally talking about same ad sales Google Ads search ads same landing page same targeting whatever works great and Florida New Jersey a little bit in some parts of Texas was awful in DFW and intolerable in Colorado like and literally is the market somehow since the meaning of the location. So I know that sounds like an excuse or a non answer but the thing is, is that we are doing in Indiana essentially the same thing that we're doing in North Carolina so it's not really it's not like we produced two separate sets of ads and the set we ran in Indiana work that and set in North Carolina we're good it's the same ads you know what I mean? Yep. So then I know everybody hates that answer but that that's all I got on that right now.

Matthias Miller  1:03:31
So I think that's fine. I just need to be convinced so that I think part of it I should probably ask myself why do I feel like I needed to can defend myself for higher prices. So now actual ad spend if we don't want lead flow to drop but if we're hanging around 51 leads plus or minus the out of area ones which is probably closer to 55 or something

Speaker 2  1:04:02
so this would be stick look at what what this reported 35 plus 19.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:14
Before

Matthias Miller  1:04:16
so if we level off that budget

Speaker 2  1:04:25
where does that put us for?

Matthias Miller  1:04:30
How much we'll be spending in April and how much we need to spend

Unknown Speaker  1:04:33
in May.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:35
Right Give me a minute let me poke some buttons here

Unknown Speaker  1:04:42
so days

Speaker 1  1:04:55
that 5050 51 figure is per week. What was that? yeah for

Matthias Miller  1:05:00
per week, I mean it's 55 for keep it 55 per week to accommodate for out of area stuff.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:07
Okay, and one second

Matthias Miller  1:05:10
and more specifically, I think we keep Facebook kind of where it's at and whatever that number would be and

Speaker 2  1:05:17
we're seeing about 20 I agree and it's going to be easier to isolate

Speaker 1  1:05:24
and all as well wait, I want to make sure we're having the same conversation we are talking about Google we are talking about Indiana only and we're talking about last week the week second through the eighth and in Google we only got 90 leads that week with that so the rest of the 50 Something came from Facebook right we're on the same page with that

Unknown Speaker  1:05:49
Yes. Okay, just suck it up I'm

Unknown Speaker  1:06:06
gonna checks

Unknown Speaker  1:06:41
see

Speaker 1  1:06:48
I got a point to make But hang on just so yeah, divided by four.

Speaker 1  1:07:28
And then I need one more figure this month to date. We have already spent

Unknown Speaker  1:07:38
five grand.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:13
Okay,

Speaker 1  1:08:13
ready for an answer. Okay, what I and I'm gonna explain this in detail. But what I would like to do is keep things the way they are today. Which would mean that by the end of the month, the total ad spend for Indiana on Google only is 12,000. Basically 12,500. Okay, here's the odd part. Last week, we clearly had issues it was Easter. Yes, things like Easter actually affect the real world. And last week, we spent you're ready for this. Last week we spent $2,600 got 90 leads with a CPL of almost 140. But this week now that Easter has gone, who's only spent 1700 We've already had 20 leads and that dropped this week, CPL down to 85. So like last week was just a red herring. And we're back much closer to normal in the last four days of this week.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:16
What's the answer to the high CPMs?

Speaker 1  1:09:20
I get so uncomfortable tying single answers to things to like we honestly don't know. Yes, I think there's a lot of truth to that.

Matthias Miller  1:09:27
broad brushstrokes. Yep. Week aberration. That's the answer.

Speaker 1  1:09:33
And for all I know, I'll run the same figure in 24 hours and I'll go from 85 back to 95 Likes, you know the habits daily. See the graph but sure. Can we aim towards that and then like we can reevaluate and make a better new decision at the end of April. Oh, I mean, or next week if something goes off the rails or something but I'd like to aim towards. So that would make April's Google spend eight for Indiana a grand total of 12,500

Unknown Speaker  1:10:01
Okay, so budget planner. So April, so we would be

Matthias Miller  1:10:16
so this is what we invoice which means that how do we want to count for this in the spreadsheet, we would have a $2,000 credit that we would apply to next month. Next month instead of the 14 five, we would Bill 10, five in the following month, we would go back up to 12. Five,

Unknown Speaker  1:10:31
correct. And let me share screen in a moment. Sure, I actually get this up on my screen.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:40
What is it say draft drafts?

Unknown Speaker  1:10:50
I don't know about you,

Speaker 1  1:10:50
but I find that the harder I tried to organize them, the worse it gets.

Matthias Miller  1:10:58
If I would invoice this as minus $2,000

Unknown Speaker  1:11:02
for April, underspend, then we could do 12 500 going forward. And that would use a lot of confusion.

Speaker 1  1:11:15
Let me Can I share screen? And are you are you looking at something like this? Are you looking at something else? Yeah. Okay, so I know this looks insane. But here's how this works in my head. So this blue is literally so that I do not lose track of what you have invoiced the client for. That's it, that's the whole point of that. Okay, so you have from the beginning of time, until right now, you have invoice the client, a cumulative grand total, I need to fix the blue and the black here, but accumulative grand total of 236,000. Okay. And so down here, I am tracking two things simultaneously, I am tracking all three, I am tracking what we should be spending per channel on that particular months. And total that particular months versus and literally by month, I mean one separated line at a time versus the great grand total. Because on any given month, if you pay real close attention to this, on any given month, historically, this was like a ledger, one month, we didn't spend enough, the next month, we spent too much too much. The next month, we were almost right on. And this is literally relative to the great grand total. And so when you get down to current time comparing what we've actually spent in April, versus what we actually build in April, we literally have a great grand total cumulative of 29 500 left to spend. So if this number went down to zero, we would have spent every penny of what you actually built. Right? in April. I'm sorry, in March we actually spent a little you probably remember this we spent a little too much in January. Not quite enough in February I was actually glad to have a little buffer at the end of February because I'm tired of that on accident and then I got a little too conservative in March and so we can't we came to the end of the march having not spent 2304 of what they had actually paid you make sense so so that leaves us with the amount we build in April plus 2300 leftover from March as what was left to spin right there. Does that make any sense at all? Yep. And of course said no, nobody updated this today. I don't think so. We're we're off on this row right here just a little bit. But yeah, so if we then take this and we say you know we had build them from 14 Five but we're only gonna spend

Unknown Speaker  1:14:01
12 five

Speaker 1  1:14:05
total then we got a $2,000 discrepancy right there and and for the month not not for the whole but for the month. And so you would just Yeah, however you want to do it. You would reduce budget by 2000 for the May but also and further $2,000 credit for what we did not spend that we did before and April and so totally agree until you do you do $4,000

Unknown Speaker  1:14:31
Less. Yep.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:39
I am the world's worst

Unknown Speaker  1:14:40
mathematician and when horrify any teacher

Speaker 2  1:14:55
Okay, I will um Just send us an email with changes to the

Unknown Speaker  1:15:26
little noise again,

Matthias Miller  1:15:31
do you know of anybody who is looking for anybody who's sharp, good with repetitive tasks, good with numbers and accuracy and is looking for a part time flexible job you can work from 95% of your work can be from midnight to 4am if you want to, and everything.

Speaker 1  1:15:51
I'm not off the top my head. I've been thinking that through a little bit. I actually do know a lady in my church who's a single mom who would probably like something like that. What are the specs again? And what is the task in general? bookkeeping. Oh, it's bookkeeping. Okay, it sees a bookkeeper. So tell me more?

Unknown Speaker  1:16:10
Well, so

Matthias Miller  1:16:13
we've outsourced our bookkeeping. And price of bookkeeping practically doubled. And this lady's we're competing with a $10 million company that she's doing finance for. And she just got done hiring a whole bunch of folks. And normally, she's been pretty good about staying on top of it. But we're weakly on invoicing this. And now we have back and forth

Unknown Speaker  1:16:33
with the client. Which means

Matthias Miller  1:16:39
once again, even though I gave her verbal approval to send it off, it wasn't good enough and they got messed.

Unknown Speaker  1:16:47
And so can we get

Matthias Miller  1:16:49
higher quality work for half the price? I would be delighted.

Unknown Speaker  1:16:56
When what is half the price?

Matthias Miller  1:16:59
We are I had been paying my former team member about 20 bucks an hour, something like that. 20 lower 20s. She had good experience at that point. We've been steadily bumping it up. And she was just straight up faster and more accurate. Like it was she was in the groove when she did this stuff.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:22
We are currently paying somewhere.

Matthias Miller  1:17:28
I mean, there's certainly higher costs. Initially we're paying about 750 a month. I'm paying about 750 a month for bookkeeping, some HR and payroll processing some post office pickup

Unknown Speaker  1:17:43
stuff

Speaker 1  1:17:50
great. So something like $20 An hour would work again.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:55
Well, I mean, if she's in the ballpark of as efficient.

Matthias Miller  1:18:00
I mean, if she'd have to learn a new accounting system, that's the biggest downside.

Speaker 1  1:18:04
And what is that system? She currently uses QuickBooks.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:08
It's our accounting system.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:10
Okay. About how many hours a week do you think?

Speaker 2  1:18:17
So I had been it's, we see this to over eight. I think it's about maybe it's five to 10 I think it's only five to 10

Speaker 1  1:18:37
This is amazing. I was actually so my mom has been my current let's say this already. So my current bookkeeper for years and she's starting to have an accident she was having a stroke which we took her to the doctor and the doctor said No, she wasn't whatever that means, but I'm starting to have some sporadic mental issues. That sounds horrible, but you get the point like having trouble recalling and things like that. That was a terrible choice of words. But I started listening I just realized that I need to at least get her some help start getting somebody trained. And so I was asking around for a bookkeeper here locally a couple of weeks ago and guess so one of these people HR two units a single mom. Sadly her home situation is a little bit rough but she does have kids at home she homeschools she's trying she's looking for stuff exactly like this bookkeeping. She said $18 an hour the way she said it I can tell she was wishing to get paid a little more than that. But so 20 should be great. 20 Something like that. She's done this off and on for many years. And I I've never seen the quality of her bookkeeping work, but I would I would trust her and I think it'd be worth a shot you want me to make a connection? You can yes questions. And her name is Amy so on. ala naming whatever your email address or something?

Unknown Speaker  1:20:03
Yeah, that'd be good.

Matthias Miller  1:20:06
I've literally got an audience of homeschoolers because I was like, are people searching for homeschool stuff? So I was like this would be a really interesting be a great job for her homeschool mom.

Speaker 1  1:20:19
Yeah. And she is looking for off hours because of that. So this might might actually really make her day want to let me talk to her and see if she wants to just

Matthias Miller  1:20:28
just with this there's one we do have to have a weekly 30 minute call fit in sometime during the visit during business hours.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:41
But I'm assuming that's going to be

Speaker 1  1:20:44
so I wouldn't I would think that'd be totally workable. Yeah, only she can say that but I would think so.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:51
And of course training time too but ya

Speaker 1  1:20:53
know, and other anything go ahead

Matthias Miller  1:20:57
the other side No, that's worth considering we are we have a client who's looking to just signed on for Platt integration to import transaction data so

Speaker 2  1:21:05
if that happens, it might be even fewer hours but easier work I don't know how that's gonna progress at this point.

Speaker 1  1:21:22
Well, let me just follow up on that and in fact, if you don't mind I'm going to send her a quick message that I want to talk to around a bit.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:26
Okay, do that

Speaker 1  1:22:29
and I'm also writing a note to my team so they do not raise the budget tips on Google anymore today.

Speaker 1  1:23:06
Oh and I just realize I got too many thoughts running through my head at the same time just one second

Unknown Speaker  1:23:16
referring to budgets one moment Sorry.

Unknown Speaker  1:23:37
Okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:23:37
so

Speaker 1  1:23:41
I need to correct what I said about how you would build from a and actually what when do you build for them shortly? I need to Okay, let me give you a different figure from a it's that simple. So I think first I need to double check to make sure I don't cause

Unknown Speaker  1:23:58
an error. April 1 due

Speaker 1  1:24:02
today in the last few days we've spent the most we spent was 497 on a Sunday. We spent 417 On Monday, brought her on to port 21 So on average okay. Now this was this is looking good. And so for May, there is 31 Days in May.

Unknown Speaker  1:24:28
Mays,

Speaker 1  1:24:30
the amount you need to build for May is $1,000. Higher so basically 13 five okay. And then for April it will still be 12 Five what we're expecting to actually spend

Unknown Speaker  1:25:47
Got it.

Matthias Miller  1:25:50
Alright, so Jonathan is okay, so

Speaker 2  1:25:58
13 502,000 credit for APR. Starting in May. David spreadsheet, updated invoices, okay, now,

Matthias Miller  1:26:17
I really, really, really want to get to this fun conversation. But there is one more thing yet. Two more things actually offline conversions.

Speaker 1  1:26:28
This is my bad, we started to set it up by trying to pass it off to my team and they had a glitch and I did not stop and help them fix it. So I will get that done this week for sure. I do need something from you, I'm going to email you if you don't mind. The format. It's literally a spreadsheet CSV template that Google wants. And if possible, what I would like is if you can create a script or whatever that would create that CSV. On a web server with a publicly accessible URL, we can use HTTPS, if we need to protect it is where Google will just read that file straight off a web server every day, like every 24 hours, and sort of suck in the new data. That works exactly like that for Google. Also works like that for Bing. If we ever ended up doing Microsoft ads. I think Facebook has something similar, but I was not able to plumb the depths of that all the way yet. So I'm not not 100% sure

Unknown Speaker  1:27:29
how that works on Facebook. But we'll get there. Okay,

Matthias Miller  1:27:33
so question on that we have fun fact, we recently had a case where we had somebody go on Google don't fill up type form retarget on Facebook type form, got hit on Facebook, and our leader clicked around on Facebook, and then bought the next day. Kind of a fun story. And so how do you give weight I give it a here's my purchase ID and that way Google knows that these two clicks both contributed to the same purchase right

Unknown Speaker  1:28:10
I don't know how that works.

Speaker 1  1:28:10
In theory, you need what are you calling purchase ID so the bad news is purchase ID is not a column that will let it'll suck in with the offline conversion in force. The only thing it takes is the GCL ID and the value sounds like they might I don't know how smart Google is about knowing that that person has come back and click the second time but I think they know I'm really curious are the are you able to see if they got to GCL ID is assigned in the process

Speaker 2  1:28:51
Facebook gives me two FB quads but I don't know that ever seen. Let me see if I can find your hang on vinyls. Only check one thing here she's asking about that. We were going to build him 18 grand for Google Ad Spend

Speaker 1  1:29:14
that let me just double check but I think that sounds reasonable that we were going to work up much higher than we are seven and seven and where is

Unknown Speaker  1:29:35
in theory, I have a document that says this question is where is that document

Unknown Speaker  1:29:47
went through your new wonder he was asking about right here we April, Google we build another seven grand That is correct we had been 75 Yeah yeah I think we might have been looking at maybe going up that high but

Matthias Miller  1:30:15
I mean either way grand total you're still looking at

Unknown Speaker  1:30:20
yeah we only we had see 16 says 18 grand on Indiana up to 80 grand

Unknown Speaker  1:30:26
yeah

Speaker 1  1:30:30
I'm just now stuck a Lincoln signal if you open that that's what we had verbally talked about and I think we wrote off to

Unknown Speaker  1:30:36
them as well

Unknown Speaker  1:30:40
and yeah, it literally says 18 grand for Google that was what we're going to ramp up to as a max

Unknown Speaker  1:30:47
Right.

Speaker 2  1:32:05
So eating tails and mine minus 13 500 should be 4500 6500.

Speaker 2  1:32:36
Me confirm that with my bookkeeper and we'll go from there all right. So the question was do we have multiple Google Click IDs?

Speaker 2  1:33:21
Okay, so Google Google yes I have a situation here January 2009 sales members close the deal they were to Google clicks involved and there were three

Speaker 1  1:33:41
I have no idea what to do about that do you want me to that's the kind of thing I can go start talking to Mike Rhodes about it or and in theory was a sort of cheat the system by subdividing the value of the sale between three different GCL IDs

Unknown Speaker  1:33:56
somehow

Speaker 2  1:34:08
you'd like to use your own attribution import fractional credit for each G click us like use external attribution

Unknown Speaker  1:34:34
I mean let me

Unknown Speaker  1:34:46
suspect what would be

Matthias Miller  1:34:51
okay if you have access to Mike Rhodes and you can ask them this question and get some good answers. I would value that for sure.

Unknown Speaker  1:35:02
And the way I

Speaker 1  1:35:03
would work, the way I would work it would be how do I deal with importing a single sale? SDDC IDs? And how do I handle the value is you want to do you want me to ask the question in a different way?

Matthias Miller  1:35:15
I think it's basically how do you handle it? I mean, it's not just the value. I mean, is there a way to

Unknown Speaker  1:35:21
to indicate which one is there a way to indicate I think

Matthias Miller  1:35:31
there's the you know, there's the the ones ones that happened before opt in there's one that happened for opt in and there's the ones that happen after opt in should we distinguish between those or not now it's possible that post opt in those actually do contribute to the sale

Unknown Speaker  1:35:55
even if they already filled out the form Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:36:02
so

Unknown Speaker  1:36:08
what

Speaker 1  1:36:11
the four opt in means they clicked they looked around, they didn't buy they came back later. What did they do after they opted in there just went there just looking at models or

Matthias Miller  1:36:23
it's after hours? I don't know what they did. After hours, they got retargeted and I mean, this is what happened with this one, one lady. I don't know for sure. But she got retard. Here's where I'd like to be able to tie a tie in the hot jar to our pixel because then you could say okay, like literally what was the customer journey of this person who bought this building? And why did they come back later

Unknown Speaker  1:36:51
this is like a big sweet step

Unknown Speaker  1:37:00
so

Matthias Miller  1:37:04
if you'd be open to chasing that, that would be wonderful.

Speaker 1  1:37:07
Let's open a conversation about and we'll see what he says oh, I think he might be on vacation this week. But either way we'll get an answer in a bit and I am sticking into signal right now

Unknown Speaker  1:37:25
you

Speaker 1  1:37:34
so referring to offline convergence in point that the him I used to be able to speak English imports, that is the CSV template that I would need your script to dump at a URL accessible place on a server and if you're interested not at all saying you should do this but there is some pretty cool programmatic stuff that could be done instead. And of course, I had to lose the page right as I said that Huertas

Speaker 2  1:38:06
reason attributed credit between zero and one let me quick review this email and send it out

Unknown Speaker  1:38:25
so Indian ad spend 13 515 100 People Google yeah

Unknown Speaker  1:38:52
reaching

Unknown Speaker  1:39:15
Okay, I'm going

Unknown Speaker  1:39:23
to be fired from server

Unknown Speaker  1:39:36
interesting

Matthias Miller  1:39:43
Okay, I think the other thing that should maybe happen is,

Unknown Speaker  1:39:47
this is not my

Matthias Miller  1:39:49
definition of weekend light, easy, fun reading. Literally printing this out, Burning Tree, killing a tree and taking it home.

Unknown Speaker  1:40:00
I'm looking at over the worst thing I could do. Right?

Speaker 1  1:40:08
And I will somehow gets the I know Facebook has something like this, it just nobody on my team knew how I've seen reference to it. So

Speaker 2  1:40:17
it's gonna be similar, though. Good. All right. Last question really don't want to. If we have a if we have a Google we're looking at taking a look at doing a visualizer as a warm, which would be hosted in a separate website. Can we do trigger a conversion pixel from a different domain? Thanks, so. Okay.

Speaker 1  1:40:55
Now I don't just think so for Google, I'm absolutely certain that we can fire a conversion tracking code on another domain as an event and it's going to feed data back into the correct system. Like yes, absolutely.

Unknown Speaker  1:41:08
Okay. Good.

Matthias Miller  1:41:11
Um, all right. So fun stuff you read for fun stuff.

Speaker 1  1:41:15
Yes, right before fun stuff. I'm not telling you to read this. But I just I found some Facebook. stuff, even as I was speaking, so here, there is a batch. And I like to not leave it with you alone. So okay, fun stuff. Ready. So

Unknown Speaker  1:41:31
all right. So.

Matthias Miller  1:41:41
So this, this, I've been getting down into data driven marketing had a conversation with Ben Morris

Speaker 2  1:41:47
a week ago. And but basically, excuse me, there was a gentleman that

Matthias Miller  1:42:00
I came across on Facebook, I don't even know how well I know how we connected we connected through Taylor Welch is network and this guy worked for ads, Labs had a falling out and said, Hey, I'm gonna go start a start my own lead gen company, or start my own data, plus cold email company. Started lead gen for this government stimulus money, that is a get gets paid, basically, for 2000 is paid 2000 bucks a pop for every business owner, he can, he can get to take the money. And so he's selling, he's basically selling free money. And so this has been, that's the lead gen and on the back end of that lead gen. He's been building out the software building out deals with data brokers, and he's got like data, you can see its consumer database, some one shared pixel, he was looking at increasing it to two, he'd have a client to pay for it. It's like 25 grand, I don't know if that's a monthly fee, or if that's a, I don't know what it is. So, and one of the most interesting and unique things is, besides the fact that he's worked for other companies before, it's a little bit of a, we'll see where this thing lands if the project makes it or not. But

Unknown Speaker  1:43:16
his claim

Matthias Miller  1:43:18
to differentiation, there's two things he's aiming for one, as a lead gen company, he's interested in getting somebody on a sales call and saying, Oh, you want leads? Sure. Let's find some folks to target. He's got a whole bunch of emails warmed up. And while they're talking on the phone, he sends out, blasts out, you know, maybe 100 200 cold emails, and somebody gets a phone call while they're still in the sales call.

Unknown Speaker  1:43:41
Wow.

Unknown Speaker  1:43:42
That's a dream idea. Oh, yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:43:45
And then the other thing that he's working on is device fingerprinting, which, you know, everybody's gonna keep locking down pixels. So what do you do, you gather all kinds of uniquely unique identifying information that you can via JavaScript, and you start cataloging people based on device fingerprints, and identity resolution. So here's what it means. In the last 30 days, we've between folks who've been searching between traffic logs from the shared pixel and from people visiting the truepoint website, we've identified an additional

Speaker 2  1:44:22
three 300 leads who did not opt in, in Indiana, okay, and about about maybe 100 100

Matthias Miller  1:44:34
or 150 in North Carolina. So this allows us to do identity resolution pre opt in, which I'm pitching these guys on. Let's do direct mail in the vicinity of brick and mortar locations and let's get people on the lot and let's turn this into a into a direct mail campaign where we send them weekly postcards for a little bit and, and get those ads Use those probably four to six impression points if we can, and see if we can get these folks on the line. Absolutely. And it's, it's a 75 cents a postcard with click Send, which means that you can automate this whole thing.

Unknown Speaker  1:45:15
So now,

Matthias Miller  1:45:17
imagine that you had Google ads at a client's subscription rate that is paid for by truepoint.

Unknown Speaker  1:45:25
And I've got,

Matthias Miller  1:45:27
I forget what it is for warm email addresses now. So I've got sending capacity of about 100 emails a day, 3000 a month. And you could take any audience that you want any search search audience that you want it to.

Speaker 2  1:45:41
And you could go email these folks anything. Or you could do direct mail postcards. So I'm kind of like,

Matthias Miller  1:45:54
oh, and by the way, you can get birthday information. And he's going to be exposed, he's going to be exposing additional data filters,

Speaker 2  1:45:59
and data feeds. In the next few months.

Matthias Miller  1:46:04
If things go according to plans and promises, so all that we'll see. But we're also getting birth dates, we're getting birthdates, phones, emails, addresses, I'm just getting set up with IP quality scores so that we can weed out bad phone numbers and bad email addresses in the opt in form. And side note, my work email is flagged as a high fraud score on IP quality score, which is disturbing, but I think there's some folks who have been sending some emails as if they were coming from me. And perhaps that's why I got flagged, I don't really know. So there's the lay of the land, and I was sitting on this thing. And I'm like, Oh, and by the way, did you know that Texas, Florida and New York, are the top states for sheds? Nope. That makes good sense. And so wouldn't it make sense then if we want to roll out a campaign that you go in those areas?

Unknown Speaker  1:47:08
Yes.

Matthias Miller  1:47:11
So I've been on this data kick. And I get one or two responses. Perry has been like, every time we talk, he's like, he told me last time when my roundtable second call, he's like, this is bordering on the edge of something that I want for a traffic Summit. If this guy has some of these things figured out. Yeah, so he's been all ears.

Unknown Speaker  1:47:32
And oh, and

Matthias Miller  1:47:35
in addition to this, I built redundant tracking. So it's not a full proxy, not full cloaking. But I want to turn on full cloaking once I have a chance to test it, but where I logging all the traffic, and all of his device, fingerprinting data, passing it through my servers, and, and capturing that information, and I have an improvement on my tracking pixel, that appears to be in some situations more reliable than his because I'm storing up visitor logs immediately, as soon as I can. And if I don't get it logged to the server, it retries automatically on a subsequent page visit. So this is how we're getting the so even if he goes away, I'm still gonna have I'm still gonna have

Unknown Speaker  1:48:29
attribution,

Matthias Miller  1:48:31
the attribution leftover for offline conversions. Now, my problem is I'm this wide I creative Alchemist, visionary, whatever it is, I'm like, this is the most awesome thing. And I mean, I'm able to pull up a list of homeschoolers, you could you go, I could go recruit a homeschool bookkeeper, which was kind of in the back of my mind to do if only I had time to kill, or you could do a Livingston survey or an ASQ survey to shed companies across the US or you could, I don't know what, like there's too many possibilities, Jonathan.

Speaker 1  1:49:13
Okay, so let's try this. Okay. So start from the well, let me try this. So this guy has a system and I think I may have just mix two things up in my head. Remember, you were telling me, probably not listening to you good enough. Remember, you were telling me a few weeks ago that you had this guy with this system that could send out cold email and it was kind of based around keywords, you know, I'm talking about so that that's part one. And then there's also this other stuff where people coming to a website, for whatever reason, can be identified, and we can follow up with them with the email or pay for mail or whatever. And that's two separate systems. And is this what we're talking about? Or have I totally missed?

Matthias Miller  1:50:03
It's the same guy. Oh, it's one of the same. Okay, great synchronicity platform. It's two angles to the same platform. So he's buying data from a shared pixel for the audiences. He's, he's, well, he's using the shared pixel together audience data, and then he's using the shared pixel to identity resolution.

Speaker 1  1:50:25
As the end, the initial traffic source can either come from him or from people on a website. Yep. The nice part being people on a website who didn't do anything like you really wanted them to call or fill out a form, they just didn't do it. But you're you paid for the traffic anyway. And you you want to hound these people into taking action. But they've left your website. So now we send an email, and a postcard.

Matthias Miller  1:50:50
Yeah, yeah. For the price

Unknown Speaker  1:50:51
of coffee. You You sent him? Send him a bunch of postcards.

Speaker 1  1:50:55
Okay. So, to me, the obvious question is, and it sounds like this is kind of limitless in the sense that should be able to work on any number of websites, any number of niches, and he never categories, right? Like, lots of possibilities. Okay? Just shoot me down wherever I'm wrong. I'm trying to get a quick and simple grasp on it. So it sounds to me like the missing thing is the offer, we now know that we have fingertip access to this amazing system, we just need to decide the thing we want to offer and who we want to offer it to or vice versa. I don't care either way. Is that right? So okay, and I'm loving this. So part one do. And I'd love to do this with you just just to make sure we're on the same page, whatever you like, do we want to play off of the idea we had previously where you and I kind of attempt to create a shared lead generation brand. And then we go find and remember, there's many possible layers to the fulfillment. Probably the easiest initial step in terms of getting our feet wet and getting a business rolling, is we just generate the leads and literally find anybody to buy those leads from us added net profit to me, that's step one. Does that go ahead

Matthias Miller  1:52:14
net net profit at breakeven, it's going to be pretty dropped dead simple. If if we don't account for too much time and sweat equity, because

Unknown Speaker  1:52:24
there basically is

Matthias Miller  1:52:26
like the costs are so ridiculously low, except, except for the postcards. But even that is so low. Yeah,

Speaker 1  1:52:34
right. We're on the same page. So like, let's let's pretend I'm literally just making this up. But let's pretend it costs us $10 To get a lead write this cup of coffee or you know, postcard and three emails or whatever. Call it $10. If if we can find people in like you said, I'm not saying it has to be this. But as an example, people in Texas, Florida in New York who are already building and selling sheds, could easily be other Mennonites or owners, but it doesn't have to be but just literally like bring them up and say, you know, we're able to generate you shed customers every single day, we're gonna give you their and I'm not wanting to over complexify this conversation. But you know, we're gonna give you their contact info, right? And then you have your sales guy calm. You pay us 20 bucks for this. They say great, I'll pay you $20 I'll buy 10 and it costs us $10 Each, we make $10 off of each we make 100 bucks right there. Right? Does that make sense? And to me, that's just like a beautifully easy way for us to get started. We've talked about many other variations, getting a network of sellers and doing software and managing it ourselves and managing the call center ourselves. We might get there someday. And it might even be good idea. If we had the profit to do it. And I think a great easy way to dip our toe in the water, establish a brand generate some income would be to use this system and do exactly that. Yep. Do you like it sound good? sound bad? Some? Yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:54:05
Yep. And a lot of my feet dragging? There's been two reasons for my feet dragging three reasons. Number one,

Unknown Speaker  1:54:11
I really don't. I don't know how far.

Matthias Miller  1:54:13
Okay, the problem was truepoint was pretty pointed out is that they're Amish. They don't want it. They don't want to take over

Speaker 2  1:54:19
the world. Yep. So that's the problem. I wish they would, I can't make them. And the sales team,

Matthias Miller  1:54:27
I can't. I don't know if I'll ever be able to get them to hire

Speaker 2  1:54:32
like a great top of the top salespeople. And so

Matthias Miller  1:54:38
I don't know if there's an out with that. I kind of think I need to just accept it and do the best I can. But do I also am not looking to undercut them. But there's a big market in Pennsylvania as well. By the way, that's another one of the top four states you might actually have been number three.

Unknown Speaker  1:54:55
So I really do want to Businesses business,

Matthias Miller  1:55:00
but I also really value what they've I value the relationship from a software standpoint, from a marketing standpoint, from a relational standpoint. And I really want to avoid, do what I can to avoid undercutting them. But what we learned here will, we can also feed into their area. And hopefully, it can be a symbiotic relationship. And we don't have to get there three is has been startup capital.

Unknown Speaker  1:55:25
I mean, if you start looking at so

Matthias Miller  1:55:30
we're looking to buy a house, the more we look at price of land and the house that we actually need for family, Versailles. You know, back five years ago, I was thought we could buy a house for 250k. And now we're looking at something anywhere from two to three times that. So

Speaker 1  1:55:47
you want me to say something that's gonna scare you to death? Yeah, tell me. So I'm in a very similar, say, I have a house that lots of good things about the house. It's way too small. And we want to farm playing simple. So I was, it was a miracle that I was able to, like get get a loan on this place and everything. And at the time, four years ago, five years ago, I couldn't afford anything better couldn't even pretended to. And in the meantime, prices here where I am, my city, my county have literally doubled in just four years. Now, this is an outlier, we've got Chip and Joanna Gaines, the fixer upper TV show, they cause part of that. So it looks a little higher than the national average. Technically speaking, it's five percentage points higher than the national average. So over the last year, I've had a couple times where I had just a little extra money. And while while busy paying debts and all it keeps in the back to my mind, I keep thinking, what if certainly not, let's say I have a net of $5,000 summit? What if instead of putting that $5,000 on debts? What if I invested it into something that's going to make me more money? So I repeatedly over the last several years, is there any such thing where I could stick $5,000 in wait for a year and get $10,000 out or whatever? Well, so I fell a while going on that bunny trail, I fell repeatedly into the real estate. Like that. That's what everybody does. Everybody who has a stable income and gets rich on any level. Getting rich is probably not the right word. But you know what I mean? They they invest in real estate, just like literally, it's what everybody does. And so I have been watching for about a year, I cannot remember exactly how I got connected with this guy that had something to do with Justin Brooke. Either Justin or somebody else adjusted likes was speaking highly of this guy who's into real estate. And so I've been talking to him. This is this fellow, it's in real estate. As an investor, I've been talking to him about how it works, watching his videos, and whatever. And he makes a really compelling case for this as a real estate investor, above and beyond the cashflow, which you might get from say rentals or Airbnb or whatever. Above and beyond that, you buy a property and you just sit on it and let it appreciate and that's where the real money comes from. And he makes a really compelling case for the fact that although sure you could make a wrong decision. In general, real estate appreciates about five to 10% per year that's national US average, as far as ownership and rent goes up by 5% per year. Now, here's the scary part. That is good for you. If you're an investor, that is very bad for you if you are a renter or trying to buy your primary residence, but it essentially guarantees that for people like you and me, every year we wait to buy a new primary residence. We will be paying five to 10% Higher next year and the next year and the next year in the next year. Think about that. Like it's terrifying from the ownership or I need a residents perspective.

Unknown Speaker  1:59:16
Yeah. Okay, well that's it.

Matthias Miller  1:59:21
I agree. Should ramble on that. What am I meant when of this? Our pastor actually, when I was starting a business, advise me against buying a home, he said, you wanna get your business together first. And there's any one piece of advice I wish I could not have followed it would have been. Screw that. Yeah, I'm gonna buy a house. And we're gonna beg borrow and steal and we're not gonna foreclose on it. And anyway, so it is what it is. We're gonna learn from it. My kids are gonna be better. Billy Eberhardt, by the way, is a user more of the kind of A charismatic, whatever he runs Andrew Wommack ministries. He's been in the business realm for quite a while at major levels. And he did a talk recently on real estate and I got some of his training. And he was, its wealth Made Simple. He explained it very articulately. So I'm completely on board with you. My goal is to create the cash machine to start feeding into that.

Unknown Speaker  2:00:28
And

Matthias Miller  2:00:33
for what you and I need to do, just got a cash flow standpoint. Three to 4 million in assets will pretty much give us what we need. Yeah. And, and so it's about 400k of cash to get to get there if if you don't consider any kind of snowball.

Speaker 1  2:00:58
Yes, exactly. Hit. Yeah. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  2:01:01
onboard with you.

Speaker 1  2:01:05
Awesome. So, okay, so then let's go back and watch and I'm lying you you tell me what you want. But like, I'm ready to go. I would like to start working with you and actually roll this out. But so so we can take, I'm just gonna call it this system, right? I don't know what you call it. But this system we're talking about, and start finding fresh new leads, buyers shed buyers that we can resell it pick a state Texas, Florida, New York Kidsport. That's one easy low hanging fruit. If you ask me. Another easy low hanging fruit. I think this is what you were starting to say earlier. But I may misunderstood you is we could add this to the truepoint websites and start sending additional offers to the people who are visiting three point but not opting in offer one is do you want to shed offer to is Do you want something else? Like maybe a planning home? Right. So that's another thing we could do, presumably right away? Is that probably what you're thinking too, and

Matthias Miller  2:02:07
I'm actively working on that. And as I'm actively working on this I building as much redundancy into so that whether I'm running this campaign in my database, or their database, or with my mind, my postcard templates are theirs, that we can relatively easily split it up for other purposes as well.

Speaker 1  2:02:36
Okay. And then would we just sell? So referring to Option B, here was Attempt number two? Would we do the work to generate these leads for two point and then like you and I would sell the additional leads to true point is that what you're thinking or

Matthias Miller  2:03:01
I'm on a retainer to help with their sales team. And so some of this stuff is just getting rolled into that retainer. And so what I was going to do, is just use that to pay for building some of that stuff out. And about the cold email campaigns. We will not be able to pitch them. Mike in particular is really conservative about growing their marketing budget, we've maxed them out, we need to optimize now. That's why I'm talking about conversion tracking. That's when you start getting better data into the sales teams. We've got email deliverability issues with the sales team lack of efficiency on the sales, we've got this whole set of sales problems, I think, possibly that we need to take a look at fixing. So I don't think from a cash standpoint we can persuade them to pay a lot more money but but we can get them to pay for the project insofar as they see the benefits and they want to allocate time based on my retainer to this project.

Unknown Speaker  2:04:19
Great and that's good. It's still helpful because you get experience with it.

Matthias Miller  2:04:24
By the way, I'm hiring Tom to write a sales letter and website in well sales letter and website for systems consulting. And at fire sale prices and anyway, I'm praying that through all of this their brain that's relevant to you'll have an encounter with Jesus and Experience experiences his peace, salvation in the midst of it. But whether or not that happens, it's been incredible working with him. And so the other another option, and I'm not sure that b2b is the right thing. And I'm not even sure this is one of those things that feels pretty memo ish to me. And I don't really have a reason why I'm supposed to be doing it right now. But it is something that's kind of one of those things was impressed on me as, like, this is the time to go do this thing. Go get it done. Kind of thing. So just went through that.

Unknown Speaker  2:05:34
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, sure. Good. Great.

Matthias Miller  2:05:44
So I, I want to stay out, I want to stay under all Rick's radar for the time being. Okay. And I think maybe this is, I don't think it's just trash. But I wonder if Florida Board is a bit of a different markets, it's going to be a unique market, I'm going to guess. But I do wonder whether Florida might be a good place to start taking a look. And if you look at leads by population, or leads by landmass, that's definitely going to be

Unknown Speaker  2:06:25
that's basically it.

Speaker 1  2:06:28
And you're telling me that there's a view some data on that inside this tool?

Matthias Miller  2:06:33
I've been exporting shed leads for across the US for up to 60 days of data. And so it's just based on the data that is collected about, I forget what it is. I need to go back and read numbers on that, but my computer anymore, but yeah, based on a belief that it's recording.

Speaker 1  2:06:55
Okay. So, let's try this. I think I know, we had several different reasons for this phone call. And we probably forgot half of them. But I think one of them that I just remembered, is we're gonna have you actually show me the software and resume. Can we go ahead and schedule another meeting to do exactly that?

Matthias Miller  2:07:14
Yes, is what works for you. I think next week, same time works.

Unknown Speaker  2:07:23
Or,

Matthias Miller  2:07:25
I might have some time tomorrow after noon.

Speaker 1  2:07:31
Let's do this. So next week, same time is Thursday, the 20th. Let's please Yes, go ahead and just schedule a call for ourselves. We can always cancel if need be we let's stick it in the calendar. And see and just say I'm just adding this to your Google Doc. Show. Jonathan the what is the name of the software? Or what do you call it for nickname?

Matthias Miller  2:07:58
It's capital audiences name is the name of the company and software.

Unknown Speaker  2:08:03
Audience okay.

Matthias Miller  2:08:07
Or capital audience? Ca?

Speaker 1  2:08:16
They're from South South Africa.

Unknown Speaker  2:08:22
Okay, good.

Matthias Miller  2:08:24
I will double check that there's not a conflict on my end because I stepped away but some good here.

Speaker 1  2:08:32
Okay, so I wrote that in your Google Doc. But then and please do send me a Google meeting invite or whatever. But then also, if you shake free tomorrow afternoon, at the moment, I do not have anything scheduled. So please just hit me up at random. And if we can both jump jump on a zoom call tomorrow. Let's just keep moving on this. This is just as a random side note so on in my personal life, I it actually is because of church stuff. I am busy at Easter, Thanksgiving and Christmas. And then of course Christmas holidays in general just like overwhelming. Not to mention clients wanting Black Friday stuff. So what that means is that flight from right now, through summer ish, more or less, it's just a great time of year for me to do. Projects, startups, just trying things. Try something. So like, let's get it running over the next few months. It's a really good time for me. Okay.

Matthias Miller  2:09:24
And are you coming out to Colorado? Can I buy you a plane ticket?

Speaker 1  2:09:28
Let's talk about this. I'm totally interested. So you said it's it's two or three days I forgot. Tell me again?

Matthias Miller  2:09:37
Three full days.

Unknown Speaker  2:09:40
And is it the weekend?

Matthias Miller  2:09:42
It's middle of the week. It's like I think it's Tuesday, Wednesday Thursday, but I'm not completely sure yet. I don't remember.

Speaker 1  2:09:53
I love it. I will if you have the email the sales pitch and sales page anything for that send it to me and I I'm a wonder, too when, if that is actually right. I almost wonder if I could stay there Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. Maybe I could even stay an extra day Friday and we could like actually talk about what we learned and what we could do with it. How does that sound?

Unknown Speaker  2:10:16
That would be dude.

Speaker 1  2:10:19
You'd be fine playing with the painting ticket I'd be totally fine paying for everything else right and hotel meals whatever. And I'm assuming you live somewhere near a motel more or less

Matthias Miller  2:10:32
