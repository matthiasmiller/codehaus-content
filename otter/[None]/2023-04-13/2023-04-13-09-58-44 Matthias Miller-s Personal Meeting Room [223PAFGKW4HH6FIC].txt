Hello Matthias Miller

Speaker 1  00:51
How are you sorry to make you waiting if someone sorry

Unknown Speaker  00:55
right on all right let's jump in

Unknown Speaker  01:24
the

Unknown Speaker  01:45
MR Porsche here

Unknown Speaker  01:59
Do you know who's typically been uploading the ads for these Sorry Good

Speaker 1  02:12
I am adding so how much delayed is added

Speaker 2  02:18
we're missing Sabourin looks like we're missing through two or three months okay

Speaker 1  02:29
okay so I was just sending ads to PCB last several months to you and I work their site so I will add it add those yeah

Unknown Speaker  02:47
we have a quick

Speaker 1  02:47
view of which ones we use last few months in that documentary work right so

Unknown Speaker  02:53
yeah sure

Speaker 2  03:09
to meet to accept investment and the vehicle you like and missing systems

Matthias Miller  03:57
I'm going to propose at least two new ads

Unknown Speaker  06:00
Just one question,

Speaker 1  06:00
How will our target audience understand GPS? Familiar? Completely? Some?

Speaker 2  06:08
I would say pretty well. Sure. Even

Matthias Miller  06:19
excuse me, I would think that even folks who don't have internet access would have a good concept. And I would think that most folks who are sophisticated enough to be thinking about software with ya

Unknown Speaker  06:54
I like it actually.

Unknown Speaker  06:57
Very good one resonates. Okay, I

Matthias Miller  07:03
think, I think the whole data we've up until now, this is partially partially because of the latest kick I've been on. But up until now, we've really pushed systems and process but we haven't really pushed data and analysis. And I think it's a fairly big angle of we can use Okay. The other one is inventory management has been a theme that has come up

Unknown Speaker  07:26
repeatedly. But there is,

Matthias Miller  07:32
but inventory management by itself is not a distinguishing value proposition. And so the question I would have is, let's segment the people who should be talking to us about inventory management and the people who should not

Matthias Miller  07:57
another theme with this has been people, QuickBooks has been increasingly locked down for people who are is becoming unavailable for people without internet access. And so that is that is a pain point although we can't help every I mean it's we can't really help those people

Unknown Speaker  08:29
so

Unknown Speaker  08:44
I mean,

Matthias Miller  08:44
that maybe we don't need to differentiate it more. Maybe we just need to be the folks talking about inventory management in this market. And that's all that matters.

Speaker 1  09:00
So are our target groups using QuickBooks or anything? Are they wanting to or the considering those but not getting that? So however they about the product?

Unknown Speaker  09:18
Think there's a

Matthias Miller  09:19
good number of folks who are aware of of QuickBooks or something similar as an inventory management tool, although I'm not sure that how many of these folks are actually

Unknown Speaker  09:39
well, I'm not sure.

Unknown Speaker  09:52
Thinking

Matthias Miller  09:57
I don't know how many of these people have actually done much research outside to QuickBooks. And so I think I think maybe, maybe it's a bit of

Speaker 2  10:05
problem aware, but not completely solution aware? Well, certainly not, not solution aware of us. But beyond just QuickBooks, I don't know how solution aware they even are.

Unknown Speaker  10:32
I guess

Matthias Miller  10:32
that's maybe, maybe I'm getting those mixed up. Maybe that's product aware, I don't remember how

Unknown Speaker  10:37
tableaus usually get divided up

Speaker 1  10:45
so here is two things. One is that if we don't talk about QuickBooks at all, we just place ourself as the inventory management solution. And it might be a separate ad where we talk about formation QuickBook or something like that, but which also positions as where we stand apart from their solution.

Unknown Speaker  11:05
Right.

Matthias Miller  11:08
Well, I don't think it's really I don't think we want to my concern is if we if we mentioned QuickBooks, we are putting ourselves even unintentionally into that category. And people are looking who are looking for QuickBooks will see it and then want to talk to us I think we should avoid

Unknown Speaker  11:31
right okay

Unknown Speaker  11:48
so let's talk about problems

Matthias Miller  11:55
okay, so generic problems are titled cash flow stock

Unknown Speaker  12:00
double entry

Unknown Speaker  12:24
such as what

Unknown Speaker  12:32
I mean I don't know what the real problems are what are the.

Unknown Speaker  13:16
Maybe it's not enough of a

Unknown Speaker  13:27
don't really like that.

Unknown Speaker  14:05
Notice I'm just coming back in just a minute.

Speaker 1  17:26
My internet was actually down so they're working on my internet line and they just fixed it. That's why I was being late and let them go

Unknown Speaker  17:52
So,

Unknown Speaker  17:53
not being a native English English speaker I am, I am bit missing the first two headline.

Matthias Miller  18:06
It might not be that good. But what I'm trying to appeal to is here's the best analogy. You remember the Apple ad about the misfits?

Unknown Speaker  18:27
Well,

Matthias Miller  18:27
I don't know if it's been a long time, think different. Here's to the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers. So, kind of what I'm wanting to the goal of what I'm appealing to is, for all you business owners who are off doing your own thing and doing it differently. Like, here's how you can manage your inventory when you're doing that, basically.

Unknown Speaker  18:55
That makes sense. That there's this year. Okay, so

Matthias Miller  19:05
here's a very common perception that, well, pretty common perception that I've heard from business owners, IKEA can't use an out of the box tool, because my business is different. Okay. Right. And on a retail solution, if you're going to sell a retail solution, and you say no, you're not different, like we can, we can support that. And then a custom solution. It's more of Yes, I understand. You're different. We can we can help you. And so it's kind of a call out more for the kind of the psychological bend of people who see themselves as not fitting the mold or not,

Unknown Speaker  19:51
you know, kind of fitting the standard Got it no

Matthias Miller  20:05
this one I really don't I really dislike it's really weak and another idea when you were gone

Unknown Speaker  20:28
since I like the second one what you explained

Matthias Miller  20:34
is there a way that we could say it that would make

Speaker 1  21:05
oh by the way have you tried GPT to write headlines or copies I

Matthias Miller  21:12
have not bid well actually sorry yes I have I have some

Unknown Speaker  21:18
so

Speaker 1  21:23
I don't know how good they are understanding this ratio and what we're trying but are writing copies Facebook posts I have got good results even emails

Unknown Speaker  22:12
well let's just see what it comes up with. And I was

Speaker 1  22:19
thinking like the line you wrote you can give it and ask to write separate versions of this

Unknown Speaker  22:25
right

Unknown Speaker  22:35
so why not

Unknown Speaker  22:36
to maybe or to get

Unknown Speaker  22:40
out of course this loss

Unknown Speaker  22:54
right let's try this

Matthias Miller  23:42
I like the idea of flexibility

Speaker 1  23:53
Yeah, I tend to like number eight and nine and also eight might be better. So, nine is also simpler and clearer

Unknown Speaker  24:09
if not stronger.

Matthias Miller  24:13
Here's another Okay, let's use these as some ideas

Unknown Speaker  25:36
gymnast.

Speaker 2  26:23
Think it's here

Unknown Speaker  27:06
that's not a good prompt or something

Speaker 1  27:12
we make such each line the last one which he later

Unknown Speaker  27:34
and we could also have time to do

Unknown Speaker  28:02
I kind of like this

Speaker 1  30:07
Do you need to use flexible inventory management solution or something or does it make sense is considering inventory management that helps to meet these needs

Unknown Speaker  30:21
use flexible

Unknown Speaker  31:25
yeah

Unknown Speaker  31:38
see your unique needs help you

Unknown Speaker  31:54
is it whether or how to find out

Unknown Speaker  31:58
notes

Unknown Speaker  32:11
customer centric no better manager

Unknown Speaker  32:39
was very good to be actually

Unknown Speaker  32:47
what's this one down make history

Unknown Speaker  33:03
alright so then we need one more normally we do an article

Unknown Speaker  33:08
aren't we going to use a successful one or article?

Unknown Speaker  33:14
Oh sure.

Matthias Miller  33:15
Yeah let's do a no yeah good

Unknown Speaker  33:36
so there's the see which ones were they again vehicle we did again x and safe investment

Speaker 1  34:03
any seasonality issue like we are running this as to June July and August

Matthias Miller  34:11
summer summers probably the biggest thing back to school

Unknown Speaker  34:18
vacation

Matthias Miller  34:20
most people aren't going to their site as much destination travel actually more in the winter.

Speaker 1  34:26
I'm just talking about any lead lead pack that at that actually. If is there there is anything that naturally falls within that summer vacation or some stuff like that.

Unknown Speaker  34:39
Now, thanks. So

Matthias Miller  34:47
we had talked about remember this one we had talked about doing a wheat harvest one. This is a new ad not a proven one.

Unknown Speaker  35:26
Your backs

Unknown Speaker  36:00
we do the burnout more than once this is a quadrant again

Unknown Speaker  36:27
key point we landed

Unknown Speaker  36:42
it wasn't no it was a referral though

Unknown Speaker  36:59
we could we can try this one again too okay well let's here's the other approach

Unknown Speaker  37:26
you just need more content

Unknown Speaker  37:48
what do we do score card

Speaker 2  38:19
your x working missing systems vehicle to reduce your workload

Unknown Speaker  38:31
streamline is your business what do we do the scorecard again yeah I'm liking that actually

Unknown Speaker  38:51
so let me just let's actually open that up and I don't really have any preference how what order these things go out

Unknown Speaker  39:25
good

Speaker 1  39:28
yeah. Updated to here. We haven't Should we just asked viewfinder to design however the like or do you need to give any idea about the images

Unknown Speaker  39:40
might be fine. Let's see GPS

Unknown Speaker  39:54
see, let me get this in here.

Unknown Speaker  40:21
We just did a proven ads we could

Unknown Speaker  40:45
I think GPS is pretty clear

Matthias Miller  40:48
Finland scorecards already designed inventory we probably could my thought would be the I don't know like

Unknown Speaker  41:01
right here

Unknown Speaker  42:03
okay,

Unknown Speaker  42:03
so PFS will change to black

Unknown Speaker  42:08
it's black and bull

Unknown Speaker  42:12
feel fine, right?

Unknown Speaker  42:15
Yeah, that's right. It's actually BAC black and we're creative. Sure. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  42:25
I will send this to their way for design. Awesome.

Matthias Miller  42:32
Yeah. You want to, you'll send it out for you're gonna get feedback on any of the ad copy or I guess else is that until next.

Unknown Speaker  42:42
And I guess you're heading out.

Matthias Miller  42:45
You might simultaneously send it out for design and for feedback on ad copy, perhaps.

Unknown Speaker  42:57
Cool, good. Appreciate it.
