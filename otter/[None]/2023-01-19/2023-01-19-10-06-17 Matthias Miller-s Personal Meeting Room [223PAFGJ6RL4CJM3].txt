Unknown Speaker  00:04
All right sorry about that

Unknown Speaker  00:14
are you either

Unknown Speaker  00:21
all right now I'm here okay sorry about that okay see what what else do you need yet

Matthias Miller  00:36
on this to feel comfortable driving and ahead um I think one thing would for sure be obviously this would be an LS thing but getting kind of a budget idea of how much he wants to spend for this because that's kind of kind of going to kind of

Unknown Speaker  01:00
yeah kind of determine how much we can do Yeah, what exactly were we talking about right at the end of the last one

Unknown Speaker  01:18
let me share my screen

Matthias Miller  01:20
let's let's start to flesh out because there's some fairly specific details that are definitely not here

Unknown Speaker  01:27
right so postcard

Unknown Speaker  02:09
probably the biggest thing.

Matthias Miller  03:39
You'll appreciate this we did this before we knew you were working for us

Speaker 1  03:47
we'd have a be like Ben had series we've done a deal like and it's been offered to be like Bob So here is

Unknown Speaker  04:09
this one

Speaker 1  04:24
and then the other one was this one

Unknown Speaker  04:40
nice

Matthias Miller  04:42
and then we're going to be doing one in a few months on

Unknown Speaker  04:45
been getting his business ready for to hand off to his kids and grandkids basically the idea of legacy nice

Matthias Miller  05:02
So I was thinking there might be some kind of show good

Unknown Speaker  05:05
idea there but what would be

Unknown Speaker  05:22
I wonder what his topic is about

Unknown Speaker  06:00
do we want to have a timeline on this as well

Unknown Speaker  06:13
yeah I mean it's it's been what like a month

Matthias Miller  06:23
no I mean like I mean on the response sheet asking them

Unknown Speaker  06:28
gotcha gotcha um

Unknown Speaker  06:38
yes not a bad idea

Matthias Miller  07:06
do we need any kind of do we want any kind of additional basic information

Unknown Speaker  07:11
on here's an idea

Speaker 1  07:22
base builders case study could be a pretty interesting what if we did this I don't know we can get it done by then or not

Unknown Speaker  07:45
Where's

Matthias Miller  07:52
if we can get done we have drafts. That could be a pretty interesting avenue to go down

Unknown Speaker  08:05
don't know maybe I'm just

Unknown Speaker  11:20
kind of the broad ideas that I'm thinking of is something like

Unknown Speaker  11:31
that broad the broad concept

Matthias Miller  11:33
would be if there'd be a way to describe it as word being worship have

Matthias Miller  11:45
some way of describing taking pride in craftsmanship

Unknown Speaker  12:03
or

Speaker 1  12:18
streamline is a word that we use a lot thrive is the word that we use sometimes

Speaker 1  12:50
we want it to be saying that is referencing a business or just a general saying probably something that's referencing a business still right probably moving towards business or leadership something that would apply to probably something that would apply to leadership in some form

Unknown Speaker  13:26
if we do a saying not sure what else we do

Speaker 1  13:45
this feels I don't know very generic and kind of cheesy cheesy I guess but something about like good leadership equals thriving business like we could we rework that somehow Sure. I'm still getting some ideas down

Unknown Speaker  14:42
don't think the do less thing actually.

Speaker 1  14:51
Yeah. Doesn't really see the good and the bad of the work ethic. Go

Unknown Speaker  15:30
What are other things that we have in the?

Speaker 1  17:14
like that last one he just put it on eight automate electric strive imagine like a big like curly brace kind of thing

Unknown Speaker  17:40
I don't even know what the actually we could just do this

Unknown Speaker  18:02
no this is like absolute worst

Unknown Speaker  18:21
this is definitely not professional graphics

Unknown Speaker  19:21
Yeah

Unknown Speaker  20:02
Gotta like it it is it's actually really useful

Matthias Miller  20:08
like this is something I literally want to look at every single morning to remind me

Unknown Speaker  20:12
am I doing this right yeah that I really like that okay

Matthias Miller  20:28
I think you could with something like this you might be able to

Unknown Speaker  20:36
get away with the contractors logo on the other side I don't know though. I'm not sure how I feel about that

Speaker 1  20:58
or could you do like crafters international like running down the handle or something? So it's a little less in your face, but it's still on the outside of the mug

Unknown Speaker  21:21
Can you do that as seen seen it done before not actually done anything like that. But I've definitely definitely seen it done, let's just do this

Unknown Speaker  22:06
purpose of smoking will guide your channel, this is very?

Matthias Miller  23:04
What do you think of the case study idea? Is that just going too far? asking too much. What exactly is the case study again? We're running case studies on the projects and two projects that we did for faith builders. Gotcha. But we haven't here's the here's the The only downside is that we haven't gotten approval from them yet. And I don't know if I commit to trying to get that before them. Yeah, I wouldn't commit to anything unless they said it was. It was good once we're done there. Okay. So here's the proposal. Thanks to Ben for his genius on this stuff. The main things on the table will be okay, first of all proposing that on the debate on the front as the eyecatcher that we use your fake face and excellence in software and actually bring it more personally towards you. Okay, sure. And do you put

Unknown Speaker  24:10
I'm fine with that you also put the code crafters logo on it.

Unknown Speaker  24:13
Presumably? We don't really care. Okay. Go ahead. The reason for putting your face on it.

Matthias Miller  24:26
Okay, so if if the table is geared towards both retail and custom, then using the Excellence in software tagline might work better to pull people over? I don't know they feel strongly about good directors logo versus not Yeah.

Speaker 1  24:56
Would you would you rather just keep it strictly co-directors branded, custom software focused.

Speaker 2  25:05
I'm pretty happy to have retail software stuff there. And I don't think anyone's going to be too grumpy about. I mean, I don't think anybody's going to ask me to remove it because it's doesn't have the code drafters logo on it.

Unknown Speaker  25:25
So the

Speaker 2  25:32
the one that I mean, it's an it's interesting with the face thing. Now the one thing to think about, though, is that this is we're gonna have a whole bunch of old order Amish. So although they're not the ones we're interacting anyway, on the other hand, the it's a great question.

Unknown Speaker  25:52
We should put your name on here though.

Unknown Speaker  25:55
Definitely. Name Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  26:00
Go ahead. Good. I mean, we could do

Matthias Miller  26:04
I don't know if you want to, we could just do a Ellis Miller code crafters, international excellence in software. If you the thing about putting the company name there is that it does.

Speaker 1  26:19
If you do care about the demographic, it does pull it a little bit away from the picture.

Speaker 2  26:25
Sure. Yeah. I think I like having the company name there. Because I mean, I do think that I mean, and I'd probably include the logo.

Matthias Miller  26:38
Sometimes we're gonna have to do logo work so that we have code crafters, international and just code crafters. Maybe just code craft or software or something for the US, but that's fine.

Unknown Speaker  27:00
Okay, are you okay,

Matthias Miller  27:01
using the Excellence in software tagline? Or would you rather

Unknown Speaker  27:03
keep doing the?

Unknown Speaker  27:09
That's a great question. Because,

Matthias Miller  27:13
I mean, the business software built for you is the current tagline.

Speaker 2  27:18
Although Okay, well. I suppose what you could do, I mean, yeah, I suppose what you could do if you would do you know, do one of, you know, one of my pictures? And? And if anything on the picture, I think I would probably not go I mean, how would How would you say? Maybe that's maybe the two are the same size? I don't know. So yeah, so if you'd have Ellis Miller, and my picture and underneath Ellis Miller, and then over on the other side, you've got code crafters international with the logo. So in a sense, the logo is the picture for the company. And then and then just across the bottom, yeah. Looking you know, excellence in software probably tying in logo colors. So

Unknown Speaker  28:14
yeah.

Speaker 1  28:28
Do we have we don't have merging tools here?

Unknown Speaker  28:33
Just create another table underneath it

Unknown Speaker  28:42
Do you

Matthias Miller  28:43
You're brilliant.

Unknown Speaker  28:47
Do do we? That's enough.

Speaker 2  28:52
I don't think we need rather and because this is all on a four foot banner. I mean, uh, you know, four foot and then however high a table is off the floor.

Speaker 1  29:01
So there's upgrades at the top to catch more eyeballs, or I don't know if it matters Actually, your face might actually be just as good two matters. I don't know that it matters.

Unknown Speaker  29:15
I think I'd probably put on the bottom but I'm not sure.

Matthias Miller  29:44
So that's the proposal to draw people to the table at the table. We're thinking of having kind of oversized postcards. Ben's going to come up with a good size, you know, bigger than four by six smaller than eight and a half by 11. And just a heavyweight postcard. That's basically Just very brief basic information about it. Almost like an overseer. Yep, who we are what we do your picture my picture? I mean, you'll have one we'll have one for crafters one for code house phone number scheduling link, email

Unknown Speaker  30:25
etc.

Speaker 2  30:28
on the on the code house code house, well maybe it's not necessary, it's not necessary as they're going to. I mean, there's two companies on the thing they're gonna figure out we're connected. And here's an interesting, I mean, here's an example where having we're having similar names is actually to our advantage code Kraft raincoat house.

Matthias Miller  30:54
It's pretty easy to predict it and brothers

Unknown Speaker  31:00
actually, kind of hard because I've got more here than you do.

Unknown Speaker  31:03
It's true.

Matthias Miller  31:06
I'm pretty sure we can get some kind of a I think to make a photo of me with your

Speaker 2  31:13
it's a beard on afterwards, your beard. fans got a good beard.

Matthias Miller  31:21
One thing that got overlooked, that is lovely that got overlooked here. Okay, moving on. Okay, and then, and then we'll have a signup sheet that basically says, like a little bucket to put names in a little tablet and pen and stuff. Name, email, phone number best way to contact checklists, we interested in retail software, customer software, we're looking right now within six months, within a year, we're just exploring. And so just the way to collect leads, so that's literally the table, then we're thinking 10 to 20. Mugs.

Unknown Speaker  31:54
Really nice. Good. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  31:56
what's the one step back on that one? The are you thinking? Are you thinking of having any of the newsletters printed or not?

Unknown Speaker  32:12
We're not necessarily.

Matthias Miller  32:13
No, we're thinking what we're trying to do is to get people to raise the number one goal of this is to get people to give us their contact info. Yeah.

Speaker 2  32:23
Okay. Now can with a checklist, do you want to have a Do you want to have a checklist, you know, request free articles and list the articles that they could request?

Unknown Speaker  32:42
I like that

Speaker 2  32:56
and do we then if we do that? Do we want to have the ads kind of in a I don't know how you would do it but I mean, you could almost have a you know, free article resources and then and then highlight and then actually played it with our ads or modified versions of the ads underneath that so you could so you would actually see the ad for the the vehicles of software.

Speaker 1  33:22
Why wouldn't we put it on the back of the postcard? Oh, interesting. Maybe Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  33:39
Don't know what I offer on the courthouse

Matthias Miller  33:40
so sure.

Unknown Speaker  33:51
Offer the escaping ERP Hill

Unknown Speaker  33:57
Why don't you change that to escaping ERP winter?

Matthias Miller  34:02
I have an Anabaptist version. I forget what I what I titled escaping. What's the word? Inferno? There you go. That sounds better. Suit.

Matthias Miller  34:23
But it'd be nice to have an equivalent This is recruited for codons to figure out it'd be interesting. It'd be great to have an equivalent

Speaker 1  34:29
for code houses as well. Well,

Speaker 2  34:33
if do you just do you want it to be basically your retail consultation ad? Right. I don't know. I mean, that's just one idea. Sure,

Unknown Speaker  35:08
All right feedback on that the

Unknown Speaker  35:13
on the postcards Do you think we have room for three ads on the back?

Speaker 1  35:20
I mean, yeah, you can adjust fonts, obviously I think it depends on

Matthias Miller  35:28
I'm just thinking, I'm not thinking the ads. I'm just gonna

Speaker 1  35:32
go ahead. Sorry. I was gonna say I wouldn't, I wouldn't necessarily do for three ads on the back, I would just tell you the back one, one of the I was just looking at those a little bit ago one of the PCB e ads, and throw that on the back. Something like that.

Speaker 2  35:53
So, um, so what is on the table? It's a so what else do you have on the table itself? You've got the bucket to drop things in. Bucket

Matthias Miller  36:08
got the stack of CCI cards, stack of CH cards, tablet and pen or whatever to fill in their name. And that's and well we haven't gotten to the mugs maybe a handful of mugs but we want to get to that to

Unknown Speaker  36:23
the okay and then

Speaker 2  36:30
so we're allowed up to what was it 12 inches higher something above the table so but so what if you would get what if you would print our ads and and maybe I don't know if you actually do the literal ad itself or if you actually do it kind of abbreviated version but I'm not sure I'm opposed to literal ad. But what if you went across in forefoot you could nicely have maybe three of them like in the in the plastic acrylic whatever vertical thing you would just have the add on on Shiny Paper see in a vertical yes three stand up things and so you would so basically and I would probably put I would probably put the vehicle one in the middle because it looks nice I mean I can arrange them but the vehicle one the middle because it's kind of it's the most different and then the the the streamline business Quad Core well the other two and I don't care how I think I care which way to do it so what that says a bigger because I think with the articles the the the ads really to lead you into the article

Speaker 1  37:48
they're gonna make it too busy, too busy. It's a fair question

Matthias Miller  38:02
we could on the signup sheet itself.

Unknown Speaker  38:06
It'd be a little bigger.

Matthias Miller  38:07
On the signup sheet itself, we could have them circle, you know, please circle the picture and or like which one you which,

Unknown Speaker  38:13
which ones you want. And just put the pictures on the signup sheet

Unknown Speaker  38:28
maybe

Unknown Speaker  38:34
yes, you do want

Matthias Miller  38:35
something to grab people's attention to come over here.

Speaker 2  38:38
Yeah, I mean, okay, they're gonna so I think, Okay, we have two things there. They may see the front thing but, but people like browsing. So, I mean, you know, the other kinds of things that you could have done is is almost a I don't know how you would do it, but

Unknown Speaker  39:05
a that's interesting.

Speaker 2  39:09
Okay, here's a whole nother idea. We can't We can't put on a big monitor. So this of 12 inches high is just beer Well, that's a laptop monitor. It could be a laptop monitor or a tablet. That's a laptop that's fine. You could also have a a rotating slide display imagine maybe wrote to me I suppose we would rework our some of these ads into into horizontal mode, chop off the contact information at the bottom and some stuff like that. So it's less like this is a page ripped out of a magazine. And, you know, have a you know, and have a slideshow of interests may be interesting fun acts I don't know what it would be but but think uh you know 30 seconds to two minutes slideshow testimonials some ads people's employees faces possibly so I'm curious the

Unknown Speaker  40:25
yeah

Speaker 2  40:41
industries that we've that we serve now you have to be pretty vague on the barn building industry because at ASC ABS request but you know, custom manufacturing nonprofit, um, education

Unknown Speaker  41:01
etc whatever

Speaker 1  41:08
right I like that a lot.

Matthias Miller  41:14
I do Tam, it's going to pop it off.

Speaker 2  41:20
And, you know, yeah, well, and the nice thing about this is what we're starting to put together is stuff that we can just keep reusing. I think I like I like that a lot better than some static ads? Because, you know, just having that rotate through. Yeah, I do like that.

Matthias Miller  41:43
Okay, I got to drop in. Yep. 10 minutes. Next call.

Unknown Speaker  41:49
Um, and so on the on the on the Oh,

Unknown Speaker  41:58
should we should we have

Speaker 2  42:01
the one thing I could consider doing is having the the soft copy that we wrote for coaches, or that the copy that we wrote for coaches? Is that too, too detailed for for these clients?

Unknown Speaker  42:14
Probably.

Matthias Miller  42:15
So Ben suggestion was keeping it, catch their inter interests, get their intrigue, get them to take the next step. Because what we really easy really relaxed anyway, really?

Unknown Speaker  42:26
Exactly.

Matthias Miller  42:27
Exactly. Yep.

Speaker 1  42:29
That's so here's, yeah, I want to get into this idea.

Matthias Miller  42:34
One of Justin's feedbacks on promo items is don't brand it, like you're trying to get somebody to be a sell you on something. First up their brand ambassador, or if you bring it bring it on the bottom or somewhere obscure. So my proposal is we have tended 20 Really nice mugs like these are going to be like clay mugs, or like something that's really elegant. And you keep we put a handful on the table for people to grab and put business cards or something inside, or it's branded on the handle. And then we give you the rest, and you give it to the venue facilitator to the ATF director to people you run into and you're like, Man, this is a great contact great impression. And and handout and we probably don't actually need a ton. Sure give you those specifically to hand out. And then our idea is the bug says eliminate automate delegate.

Speaker 1  43:35
And then a little pointer to with the word thrive.

Matthias Miller  43:39
Oh, interesting. Yeah. So it's kind of your daily reminder. When you're getting your coffee Am I automating? Am I thriving?

Unknown Speaker  43:49
Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, interesting.

Speaker 2  43:51
The I'm just, I mean, I think it's kind of intriguing. The, the only thing that's I'm trying to figure out is you've got three 300 people milling around. And Will anyone ever pick up? I mean, I understand the thing of, you know, I pull a mug out of the bottom, just, you know, just the right time to hand it to the right person. But if they're on the table, and maybe it's fine. I was just trying to think

Speaker 2  44:26
if they're on the table, I mean, who are those three other people are going to be the ones that pick them off the table, I

Matthias Miller  44:33
guess. Oh, here's an idea. I don't know if you want to do this. How much are you willing to pay for lead? One of the things instead of just requested articles you can put a picture of the mug on there, let them circle the mug

Unknown Speaker  44:51
you those 300 people don't do that okay, um

Speaker 2  45:04
Okay, is there okay? Is there something halfway between the A, I just want a free mug and I circle it to to I paid for a code house, you know $1,000 consultation and I want to serve and I circle it

Matthias Miller  45:29
have a mug asterisks include implicitly you're agreeing to

Unknown Speaker  45:37
talk consultation

Unknown Speaker  45:44
free mug with purchase $1,000 So

Unknown Speaker  45:50
how expensive Do you think a really nice mug is?

Matthias Miller  45:54
I've been doing a little bit of looking at. Yeah, custom mugs. And they're running right around five $6 Each for price. I don't know exactly how much

Speaker 2  46:10
right and usually then then if you order a bunch it can be cheaper. But then you're also have shipping costs, which what is it a ship four bucks. 10 bucks. should be less than 10 though, hopefully. Um

Unknown Speaker  46:34
This one is this is just a generic one that I clicked on. Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1  46:42
Just the so looks like you can only get as low as 36. Mugs. You

Unknown Speaker  46:48
can't just get one of them. Right.

Unknown Speaker  46:52
That is

Matthias Miller  46:54
just under us. 270 for all the mugs.

Speaker 1  46:58
Shipping is just a second. By the way, another option is would be getting this made on a slate. Oh, as well. Mm hmm. So that is an idea.

Matthias Miller  47:19
There's always way more than

Unknown Speaker  47:22
I'm delivery.

Speaker 2  47:26
Okay, well, you can check it out. The one thing I would say if we do the mugs thing, let's make it look really good. Now, I mean, how bad is it to spend 10 bucks per lead? So basically, if you sign up for our newsletters then then we'll pay to pay 10 bucks. I mean, what's the worst case scenario? Worst case scenario is that we're not gonna get 100% People that are signing up. There's just no way we're gonna get 15%. So if you imagine we're not going to get 50% We're going to get but imagine we would the worst is best worst case scenario, we'd have 200 people requesting mugs, we we spend about the price of one had planned communities on mugs,

Unknown Speaker  48:24
maybe two ads. I mean,

Speaker 2  48:27
so So yeah, I like to have I'd like to have a handful on the table. But I wonder if we go ahead and say let's go oh, okay, but see if I would have the mugs there. You know, sign up for the newsletter for a free mug. Then I was thinking we would ship the mugs to them. But that's expensive. Right?

Speaker 1  48:53
You can get 36 months from this company for plus shipping for 365. Okay,

Matthias Miller  49:02
but then if we go higher level like Like what if

Speaker 2  49:05
I wanted to 200 bucks I'm thinking I'm thinking we're gonna spend something between you know, one and $4,000 Hopefully not four but

Speaker 1  49:17
yeah, 216 mugs takes you to $1,500 Okay, yeah. I'm going like this is probably

Matthias Miller  49:27
not even the right style, but that's like handmade handmade clay modes.

Unknown Speaker  49:33
That might be the price he got here.

Speaker 2  49:40
That's a little scary. Okay. I don't know that they have to be that fancy. So So then does does a mug at all have I mean doesn't make have anything about code crafters on it or not?

Unknown Speaker  49:58
We do it on the handle it on the back autom

Matthias Miller  50:00
Sure, I don't actually finding anywhere now that I can put it on the handle everywhere that I've been looking just says front rack

Speaker 1  50:07
or reference, unfortunately. Well, I mean, unless

Speaker 2  50:13
you just go go really small with, you know, code crafters and the I mean, like to coat crafters and the logo or something.

Unknown Speaker  50:24
Right. Anyway.

Matthias Miller  50:26
I don't know if you want to go with Jason again. We've gotten stuff from him in the past. Sure.

Speaker 2  50:32
And I think I would put the work into figuring out how to make the eliminate automate delegate look good. I mean, I don't even know what all that means.

Matthias Miller  50:42
I wonder if we should actually work with I think we should work with viewfinder. This one.

Unknown Speaker  50:47
I think so too. Yeah. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  50:49
I think you'd have some ideas on sourcing as well. I really probably should go, we're gonna get you will happen in here in a moment.

Speaker 2  50:56
Okay, and so, I'm thinking, I'm thinking maybe 200 bucks.

Unknown Speaker  51:00
Okay. So

Speaker 2  51:04
then somehow we'll have to have well, we'll talk more. Let's have another phone call then. But and we can talk about final details and stuff.

Unknown Speaker  51:09
Great. Great. Good work. Thank you.

Matthias Miller  51:13
Some more looking at my stuff like that, too. Yep. Thanks.
