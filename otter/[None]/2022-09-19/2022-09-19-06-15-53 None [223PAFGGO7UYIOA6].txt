So here are a few observations about being nice. Being nice means that you're going to bend who you are to fit other people's perceptions and values. One of the interesting things is that Justice basically comes down to fair scales. What are the scales that you're using the way and Are they fair by the Hebrew definition sin is effectively missing the mark. inequity is as I recall, crookedness. So ultimately, the real thing that you're after is not being nice. The real thing that you're after is hitting the mark. It's being straight as an arrow. And if that offends other people, then that then they must be offended. That is their problem. It is not mine. If they can't hit the target. That is their problem, not mine.

If I'm shooting straight fire him straight as an arrow. And they have a problem with that. That is their problem, not mine.

So we have to have to deal with facts and realities. This whole thing of nice has been a way to take advantage of people who have high empathy and have high emotional awareness. Such that I am scared to to take action that will cause somebody's feelings to get hurt.

It also goes deeper than that it goes beyond that. It's not just about people's feelings. It's about holding people accountable. Who run over other people. It's about once again justice, not not misusing or abusing power.
