Unknown Speaker  03:34
Up. Hello,

Matthias Miller  03:38
good morning. Or are you guys?

Speaker 1  03:47
Yeah, every Office, Office, staff marks, I think we open more offices.

Speaker 2  03:57
Well, yeah, I think we should know we morning. Hey. Good morning, morning.

Speaker 3  04:12
Yeah, I just, I just noticed that the the building department cider, the mug is definitely something's going in there.

Speaker 2  04:20
Yeah, I think what the post office is really

Speaker 3  04:26
post office. I thought they like, cut that whole post office.

Speaker 4  04:31
Isn't that what's happening to grandma? What is the post office going to I thought so. I think, I think we're getting a post

Unknown Speaker  04:39
office back here. Absolutely. Which one are

Speaker 5  04:41
you referring to? The part beside red mud, same village. Yeah, I believe that's yeah.

Unknown Speaker  04:50
Oh no, yeah, wait.

Speaker 6  04:53
Well, what is that gonna be? Should be like they want to put in, like, some small restaurants, cafes, you know, I. Good graphic goes, I really like to eat, as you can see, yeah.

Speaker 1  05:08
And this be exciting, this walk out of catering, yeah. So they're also also moving in the area, with small cafes supposedly right down here across the street,

Unknown Speaker  05:21
keep everybody well fed. That's the goal.

Speaker 4  05:28
Well, how is everyone this morning? Please. It

Matthias Miller  05:37
feels like a longer week than it's been. So, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  05:46
how's the wearing? Lots of snow West

Speaker 7  05:52
ours is all melted by now, and we're hitting 70 degrees on Sunday. On Sunday,

Speaker 3  05:59
yeah, I saw, my in laws were having like 50 something. So it's there in Missouri, not that far away.

Speaker 4  06:06
Dwayne probably has more snow in his area than anybody.

Unknown Speaker  06:10
It's been been melting pretty fast.

Speaker 4  06:14
They got, you said, like 14 inches on Saturday, 13.

Unknown Speaker  06:18
Yeah, this past Saturday,

Speaker 8  06:23
1313, inch, 13 inches of snow. 20 minutes, 2030, minutes from here in Lexington, they had 18. Oh, and you go 45 minutes north to hamptonville, they had six. Wow.

Speaker 3  06:40
How much did you get, like, week and a half ago in that storm?

Speaker 8  06:44
Oh, that was mostly ice. It was inch and a half, maybe mostly sleek, nice.

Unknown Speaker  06:49
Okay, so you're not building on a foot already,

Unknown Speaker  06:53
no. And then the last couple days, we got our

Speaker 3  06:56
foot pretty much from that still around.

Speaker 8  06:59
Yeah. Last couple days, it's been fairly warm, so it's most of it's kind of gone

Unknown Speaker  07:13
Good. Well,

Speaker 4  07:16
I think we have a shorter list than often, which I said that before, but I'd be happy if we can get through it in less than 90 minutes. So Matthias, anything before we start with, I'd say we just start with the payroll imports, unless you've got some, that's good. Okay, so let's start with that, maybe, if you've looked at it, then I think it's something we didn't develop for completely, but maybe it's a configuration.

Matthias Miller  07:50
Could we? Could we assign a contact? Well, okay, first of all, do you need different contacts for a company?

Speaker 4  08:00
Well, or, yes, okay, in this case, you're saying contacts as as in, like the IRS,

Speaker 2  08:10
correct, well or GD is

Unknown Speaker  08:13
like the contact as vendors, like, right?

Matthias Miller  08:16
Is there one per company?

Speaker 3  08:19
Well, if you want to be able to there would be, yeah, I don't know if they're IRS or Internal Revenue Service or US Treasury or, you know, not sure what's exactly.

Unknown Speaker  08:34
I think if you go to vendors, should, or

Unknown Speaker  08:39
would that be the right place to look.

Unknown Speaker  08:42
Or sales, no, not sales managers, vendors.

Speaker 3  08:44
But then again, we always just entered as a journal entry, or we have just went in as journal entry, and they were never assigned to contacts. So could be that, but we're no, they're still in there, because I mean, if we don't

Matthias Miller  09:02
have to assign the contacts, it's fine to the IRS. Oh, but, but basically, you would want two transactions. You would want us to sign, okay? I mean, you'd effectively just have one transaction for labor expense.

Speaker 4  09:27
Well, which is correct, like in this case, I forget the amounts, but like 20, I want to say 23,000, or so is what the bank shows.

Unknown Speaker  09:39
And, yeah, 4000 or whatever

Unknown Speaker  09:45
the bank shows separated.

Matthias Miller  09:57
But if we do this, you. You're going to did you

Speaker 3  10:02
send them those examples? And I sent one.

Matthias Miller  10:18
But I'm not sure on how to do is, I mean, I think effectively,

Speaker 4  10:40
like, Could we do something? Could we simply add a payroll category, like we or add it to that like we do for the note holders? Okay, these are being paid. Quickly pays these out of quick.

Speaker 4  11:02
Go ahead, Matthias, with your suggestion on this. Well, if you don't care how, if

Matthias Miller  11:09
you don't, if you don't care about the contact being assigned, it seems to me like we could just split labor expense and payroll taxes and insurance into two transactions. The problem with assigning, but I'm assuming that you're going to want to split between federal and state, and so I guess ultimately what we need, need probably end up needing to do is to have two categories,

Unknown Speaker  11:38
one for federal,

Matthias Miller  11:42
federal taxes and insurance, one for state taxes and insurance, and then on the accounting impact record, you would specify the payee that you want to use for each category.

Speaker 3  11:57
Yeah, and some of them are there any that would have more than one state

Matthias Miller  12:03
Okay, that's, yeah,

Speaker 3  12:06
yeah, you know, some from affordable and some, okay.

Matthias Miller  12:10
So then what we end up doing is taking the payroll item, making a list of here on the accounting company. We map from here across to a payee, and we just screwed by payee as well.

Speaker 4  12:27
That would work. Okay, you're saying this list, you'll add that to the accounting company, and then, yeah, we'll have to, we'll have a third column where we pay well. So right now, we don't even have IR the IRS was, I'm

Speaker 7  12:42
sure, aren't you saying we get rid of categories and we link to contact instead so, or

Matthias Miller  12:49
will you still need? Why

Unknown Speaker  12:50
do we need? What do we need? Categories for labor, expense, stuff?

Matthias Miller  13:00
Yeah. I mean, we need to know what is. I mean, if you wanted to, you could map that across on the

Matthias Miller  13:14
Yeah. I mean, we need to know whether it's a wage or not. Because wages are fundamentally handled differently. They're assigned to the to the contact, you could put that on the accounting company, but it's, it's, it's not, it's the same throughout, like it's not, like one company treats it differently than

Speaker 4  13:38
another Seth, you were thinking we could handle it same as the note holder accounts, right by just adding it there is that what you were thinking

Speaker 7  13:46
at some point. If we're really wanting to map from item to payee, it feels unnecessary to have a category in between, which makes me wonder if we just want to put a check, like a checkbox on the labor expense ones, because that's the only one where we need, we actually need the category. Is that right?

Speaker 4  14:14
No, or I think the categories are going to be on the top on what payroll taxes and insurance that the mapping would Be on the payroll taxes and insurance items, believe i

Matthias Miller  14:53
So basically, what you would end up having is a I don't have a good place. Stuff,

Unknown Speaker  15:09
yeah, like, if we look in this one, well,

Matthias Miller  15:22
something like this on the on the accounting company you would, You would have an accounting, a QuickBooks, item, wage, item,

Matthias Miller  15:44
and a and an account. What do we call it? Currently on the QuickBooks credential account

Matthias Miller  16:00
that would that would give it to you have an RNG of this. I mean,

Matthias Miller  16:10
basically, fundamentally, what we're saying is a wage item pulls it off the contact, the contact and financial account from there anything else you just manually assign to say where it goes. And then we just group transactions together by date and contact.

Unknown Speaker  16:33
That's saying, Yep, sounds good.

Speaker 4  16:36
Matthias, can you? Can you go to that transaction and then go to the source of that, like, the breakdown. I just want to make sure that we're all, like, the down towards the bottom. I added that accounting transaction, 87 Yeah, this. So if you, if you look in here, I think it's towards the bottom where we have that, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  17:01
like, where is the, where are the amounts we're trying to capture the 3655

Speaker 3  17:11
Well, I mean, it would be mostly these bottom Yeah, transactions, but yeah, I don't think Ohio is included,

Speaker 4  17:19
because in This one, we just have the United the contact United States Treasury. So with the proposal, you're saying,

Matthias Miller  17:26
Oh, I I get it because, no, that's a good point. No, I get it. That's,

Matthias Miller  17:39
that's what we want to do. And this does map out to it. Wait, so all we need to do is do what we're doing now. We need a what payee Do you want to use for payroll itself, the overall trend or on the bank transaction. Do you care? Or can it just be blank?

Speaker 3  18:10
Oh, I mean, I would probably call it something like payroll, QuickBooks, I think calls it direct deposit, or something like that, which I don't have to do that, but just something along with the whole payroll idea. Well, you already have a payroll, a payroll called payroll, right? Yeah, like a contact payroll, dash abc for this, I believe, because

Unknown Speaker  18:33
there's a reason you set it up like that. I'm not, yeah,

Speaker 3  18:36
it was because that way we're not saying we're paying one person, all this stuff well, because they were all together, because we couldn't split out the individual amounts,

Speaker 4  18:47
yeah, because from the bank the 20, 24,000 is all is all one?

Matthias Miller  18:53
Yeah, right. Okay, let me, let me. That actually makes sense. That's pretty simple. Let me, let me, let me play around with or let me put something together today for you guys, and you can take a look and see if you like it.

Speaker 4  19:09
So there's like, this is a there are times when we have two or three payments to the United States Treasury and those but they're they have different dates, like they might be a day or two apart. So are we looking at the dates as well? Yeah, okay, and a typical one may have, could have two of these and another two, like, one to the state of Ohio, another to the state of New York.

Matthias Miller  19:40
Basically, we'll group them together, basically,

Speaker 3  19:42
but if they would good so two payments to the IRS on the same day would get lumped together, which, I don't know that that would matter, and that's going to be very rare, yeah, mostly when you're trying to fix a mistake.

Matthias Miller  20:00
Performance. Sorry, I just realized I'm on my phone, which has got really badly. My network doesn't matter,

Speaker 3  20:12
like if you're if you're reconciling what you paid to the IRS. It doesn't matter if those are bunched together, like two IRS maintenance. I

Unknown Speaker  20:26
it, because

Speaker 3  20:28
I was just when I was like, Well, if we ever want to audit this, because I could have reconciled, yeah, those three and, but if we ever want to, you know, say, how much did we pay for this? Or how much was the direct deposit amount?

Unknown Speaker  20:50
Did you get rid of the duplicates? Did you look into the duplicates?

Speaker 4  20:53
No, no. Well, I think they're just playing duplicates. Okay, yeah, we do have a bunch of duplicates. So, so Matthias, are you going to create a proposal, and then the thought is to take it live over the weekend, or what are you Yeah?

Matthias Miller  21:10
Well, yeah. So I mean, yeah.

Speaker 4  21:14
Then I mean, ideally, what we want to do is, is, I think, is probably delete everything we have and just re import them. So so that we have a clean

Unknown Speaker  21:28
start, you don't

Matthias Miller  21:30
have to delete anything. Okay, you don't have to delete anything. If your import file hasn't changed, you don't have to delete anything.

Speaker 7  21:40
It kind of just rerun and recreate, fix the transactions or create new ones as needed.

Speaker 4  21:51
So, so the import should be, I think we have all the imports in place, except there's one maybe that's and then just either do a manual push your accounting away from the nightly update. We'll fix it after, okay.

Matthias Miller  22:08
I mean, if we, if we, if we fix it, we'll be you can

Unknown Speaker  22:11
wait till does that put you in the bin. If it

Unknown Speaker  22:19
can go this weekend, that's fine, okay, mostly, almost the more waiting on finisher reconciles,

Speaker 3  22:29
yeah, I had Spencer going to town on it. I mean, unless you missed something. But, oh,

Matthias Miller  22:41
uh, I'm the one standing between you and the reconciles

Unknown Speaker  22:47
feeling of power. Just kidding. All right, good delegate. Well, I will.

Speaker 4  22:56
Our internet is pretty. Our internet is pretty flaky on this side, so if we seem not to understand what you say, that's probably means we only got 20 or 30% of it.

Unknown Speaker  23:12
Seth hasn't moved for a minute or so now.

Unknown Speaker  23:19
I don't think that's from my side,

Speaker 4  23:30
good, so we'll wait to hear from you on that. So pretty much all of the others were just follow up from last time. Just wanted to take a quick look at if there's any questions or anything we should look at.

Speaker 7  23:53
Update Seth, look, I think some of the guys have been having one or two of these language ones.

Speaker 7  24:12
Oh, that one hasn't started yet. I kind of Jasper knocking that out today.

Matthias Miller  24:17
Seth, if you wanted to, you could add a product Change ID field to these where the new one opens a link to create a new pre populate a new incident, copying the title from here, etc, setting the TNM and all that stuff, and then you could paste the link back and kind of like what We did from cch. I think it's huge, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  24:43
that'd be awesome, fast.

Matthias Miller  24:49
All right, remittance, email link, pretty simple.

Speaker 7  24:54
Versus that, this one's this will come live. I. Okay,

Matthias Miller  25:06
and we'll say this. Do

Unknown Speaker  25:09
you think this is so this will be right? 724, is this,

Unknown Speaker  25:24
this remittance? Well, that's just the link.

Matthias Miller  25:27
The remittance email link is, is done. It's just waiting. It's it's that copying the email remittance to or the the BCC on remittance emails

Speaker 3  25:42
that is one of these other ones where we include credit memo usage in the remittance email.

Unknown Speaker  25:55
Yeah, there's a job for that. We haven't done that way.

Unknown Speaker  25:58
It's in the four point 19 one.

Matthias Miller  26:06
Yeah, it's here. Four, 1804.

Speaker 3  26:15
Okay, it's not on the Silvia. Okay, got it. I

Matthias Miller  26:23
74 merging. Accounting companies allow merging. Wait for update. Merge is into main. Well, we're feeling fun. Do you know if this has happened? No, it hasn't. Okay. All right, given eta I mean,

Speaker 7  26:45
a lot of these will get picked off in the next week or two, but I don't have specific ETAs. I mean, if there's ones we need, we should be pushing more we can these are all, yeah, I haven't been pushing as much because I know Nick's in the office there and doing some Right, right? I'm very booked elsewhere. These are ones I'm handing off to other guys. Yep.

Matthias Miller  27:15
This one I responded to, which is,

Speaker 4  27:22
you said, is there any, yeah, any testing. Okay, but we have this one assigned to to Drew. Is there something that we still need from Drew to test, or just, do we just need to close it out?

Speaker 3  27:38
Well, if I remember right, the reason we assigned it to me, it to me was just because I was planning to be going through it. And I figured if there is something, it'll show up.

Speaker 4  27:46
Oh, with your with your gear. And okay, so we should leave it open for that. Lisa, yeah, but there's nothing to do. Okay, good.

Speaker 3  27:55
Speaking of that audit, there may be something coming up in customer deposits. I found some things, and I figure out what's going on. So nothing to worry about. Yeah, okay,

Matthias Miller  28:13
not just trust me, I'll worry enough when we get there. I won't worry until then. I

Matthias Miller  28:25
another this is another one.

Speaker 7  28:26
This is one that'll happen in the next week or two, probably. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  28:43
okay, and this is the one that it is in Josh's court when you're reviewing that on the 11th for the AR report fixes.

Matthias Miller  28:57
You 42, another fast one picked up in the next few weeks. Three, also, another fast one to be picked off soon. 860, 860,

Matthias Miller  29:26
switch terminology,

Unknown Speaker  29:32
wait, Seth, where are we? What are we waiting on? Here I'm

Speaker 7  29:36
I'm making some changes to for labor intensive so that it stays parallel with

Unknown Speaker  29:45
typical structure.

Speaker 7  29:48
All right, so we're Yeah, that'll come through as the next update, because right now, labor intensive would keep changing if you would run. You're reporting again six months later and someone changed the value, then it would be the same as that was when they calculated payroll. So just locking that like we lock the production.

Matthias Miller  30:18
This one paying down technical debt. I have a proposal.

Unknown Speaker  30:23
One of the a lot of the well,

Matthias Miller  30:26
one of the biggest pieces of unnecessary complexity in sales tax balance handling and sales tax accounting impact is the fact that we still have the old method of doing write offs hanging around. And we could very cleanly convert these over into payment methods, and we could, and we could do that one of two ways. One we could, we could generate accounting impact differences for all of those, because the event type would change. Or I think, I think it would even be acceptable to we could punt that and do it in a way that basically has zero impact to you guys. We would have a hidden field on there that that says this came from a write off. And

Matthias Miller  31:21
so the biggest thing, let me see if I could find this to Matt,

Matthias Miller  31:33
from right of suggestion. I No,

Matthias Miller  31:50
no, I know I can't write us as payment methods. I put it in the wrong folder. The biggest one is that we would need a

Matthias Miller  32:09
we would need a payment method for RTO premiums, or we would need to recategorize RTO premiums, which currently got posted too.

Unknown Speaker  32:22
So are those the only RTO premiums that

Matthias Miller  32:28
we those are the only Yes? Well, these might even be voided. So let me take a look at that.

Speaker 4  32:36
Not that one is that all the RTO companies pay for premiums. We just handle them differently.

Speaker 3  32:45
Now I think that's 2003 so we're not even even having the transactions on that. Were these all 2003 Yeah?

Unknown Speaker  32:54
Because, yeah, I know that 2020 now we're just depositing it too

Speaker 3  33:03
1003 doesn't make any difference, though.

Matthias Miller  33:19
So I Yeah. I mean, the simplest thing from, well, yeah, and I don't know how we want to, how we want to handle, handle that these in particular, everything else very cleanly, maps across to a payment method. And we could basically just write an import and get them to switch over. And we coordinated on our end, and it wouldn't have much to do with you, and except for these RTO premiums, perhaps,

Speaker 4  33:58
so everything in, in into the C group there would would switch from what's in the left column to the right column. The right off reason

Matthias Miller  34:10
it would switch? No, well, it switched the other way it would switch from. So these are, we pick a more recent one like this. One has a write off reason of green sky, and this would move into a new line dated on 321, 24 for 6466 8465 as an adjustment for financing feed new payment method.

Unknown Speaker  34:41
So can you just assign the RTO premium ones to also go to, like adjustment for financing premiums. It's down about 20 or so, and

Matthias Miller  34:58
then you're going to get accounting and. Packs. No, we won't. Is that before the effective date?

Speaker 3  35:07
It is, it is so it's not. It won't even try.

Speaker 4  35:12
Well, do we even? I mean, can you set your Is there a reason for it? Matthias, you have a lot of pre 24 listed here. Do you need to do? Can you just ignore those and just leave them no because it's

Matthias Miller  35:30
gonna mess up AR reporting. We know everything. It's gonna mess up AR reporting if we don't do anything with it, yeah, got it,

Speaker 3  35:48
yeah. But the ones pre 24 won't, won't be saying that they need to do a locked period correction, because they shouldn't be trying to do anything anyway. So should

Speaker 4  36:05
we write also? We'll get that point on the sales order, like In the payment section, but yeah, nothing, because

Unknown Speaker  36:36
this is

Unknown Speaker  36:43
stuff like this,

Matthias Miller  36:46
boom that gives us everything.

Unknown Speaker  36:54
Okay, Drew, have we inactivated all the old right of

Speaker 3  37:03
well, um, I think so, because they don't show up as options. Sure she started. I mean, the ones that we don't want

Unknown Speaker  37:11
him, that the payment types have weak,

Unknown Speaker  37:14
I think it's up to date while

Unknown Speaker  37:16
we're currently using

Matthias Miller  37:21
good I mean, are you guys fine? If we well, is, is you're generally good with this proposal?

Speaker 4  37:33
Then so is there anything else you we should look at This?

Unknown Speaker  37:49
On it. I don't have anything else. Yeah, i

Speaker 4  38:04
Good? Are you good? So next meeting is in three weeks, 26 we're

Speaker 4  38:16
just getting about 20% of what you're saying.

Unknown Speaker  38:18
Sorry. I'm sorry, yes, three weeks.

Speaker 2  38:32
Yay. Sounds good. Sounds good. Thank you guys.

Unknown Speaker  38:41
Thank you. Bye.
