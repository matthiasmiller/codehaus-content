Unknown Speaker  00:55
Howdy sir, Howdy. Howdy,

Unknown Speaker  00:59
if my my vacuum cleaner is making too much noise. Just say, so, no, I can't.

Speaker 1  01:13
Well, it's, that's why I put my headphones on. I was hoping to limit the noise. Yeah, I

Matthias Miller  01:24
okie dokie, so

Speaker 2  01:28
bring it to speed. Where did you get yesterday? Yesterday you were making Christmas presents with bows, and I was putting bows on top that. That was, that was Josh's joke. I he, he did something, and said, Merry Christmas. And I said, but I wanted a bow on top. And that's what he said. That's awesome.

Matthias Miller  01:57
I think I mean I tied out, I reconciled the the contract and the payment values, like the history amount.

Speaker 2  02:11
So what that means is I should be able to click a rent to own company, and we should have accurate,

Unknown Speaker  02:20
well, stuff I

Matthias Miller  02:21
have not gotten, I was just shy of importing, so, Oh, gotcha, that's the that it's a problem. So we have the non taxable subtotal, which needs to be here. I could share my screen.

Speaker 2  02:46
I'm going to walk over to this other room because of chocolate. So I'm here just

Matthias Miller  02:52
so this is the look, load fees and amounts, string table I'm and then the non taxable

Unknown Speaker  03:13
subtotal, the tax walk into my refrigerator over here, I walk in freezer, known as my conference room.

Matthias Miller  03:26
That's where you always have that's where you have the deals where, like, if you went negotiating power,

Unknown Speaker  03:34
you're like, Okay,

Matthias Miller  03:37
guys, warm up again. We're gonna freeze you into misery. Oh, man.

Matthias Miller  03:52
Okay, so we have taxable subtotal, non taxable subtotal, tax amount, those probably have to be specified. Don't they taxable amount, taxable subtotal.

Unknown Speaker  04:09
You said they have to be what?

Matthias Miller  04:11
Probably have to have zeros in these.

Unknown Speaker  04:14
I thought you said they had to be expensified. And I was like, What?

Matthias Miller  04:17
No, it's a fancy term, term for, yeah, expensive buy, yeah, nice. And then if it's rent,

Matthias Miller  04:41
okay, so this is the invoice date. Invoice entry, the entry date we need, the due date.

Matthias Miller  05:17
I thought we had a due date override. Did we lose that?

Unknown Speaker  05:21
Of course, we have a due date override.

Matthias Miller  05:56
Well, new days. It'll do there's the invoice date, just based on what they've paid. Due date is due date? It's the actual due date,

Matthias Miller  06:20
or the next no month paid. If they have paid, this isn't right. Let's work on this. How many months have they paid? Then the,

Unknown Speaker  06:48
this is the

Matthias Miller  06:56
invoice date, is actually this.

Matthias Miller  07:31
This is the next due date. Next invoice date. Let's call it that.

Matthias Miller  07:46
No, that's due immediately.

Unknown Speaker  08:25
I'm surprised you can't hear that thing.

Matthias Miller  08:29
No, you sound muffled when you when you talk about, oh,

Speaker 2  08:32
because it's probably noise canceling. Noise Canceling me too, huh? I just need to talk louder. Is that it

Matthias Miller  08:40
talk louder and then quietly fade away, so it doesn't kick it off too soon. So that sounds a little more.

Speaker 2  08:47
Talk louder and then quietly fade away.

Matthias Miller  08:53
You drive me bonkers, yet

Unknown Speaker  08:57
you said it Wait. You're saying you're not already there. Hey,

Unknown Speaker  09:11
low cash price percentage,

Speaker 1  09:20
I wonder what happened, but turn that off? Oh, I bet you can hear it now.

Unknown Speaker  09:29
No, I didn't turn it off. I don't know.

Unknown Speaker  09:35
Um, um, let's do this. Look.

Matthias Miller  10:01
We have this guy, Luke our lie. I

Unknown Speaker  10:17
want to do that. Want to do that. I Okay, then if

Matthias Miller  10:26
Loke, rly, itemization, item equals validate listering, contract, okay,

Matthias Miller  10:39
what do you call it? Invoice items.

Unknown Speaker  10:48
This guy is value.

Matthias Miller  10:57
Parameter must be string, not a number, 39 What's your problem? That's your problem. Which problem is? Okay? I don't know this is right, but it might import

Unknown Speaker  11:21
what is the? Hold on. It's gone. Now. Where was it? Scroll to the right.

Speaker 2  11:30
I am to the right, okay, and to the left. Or there was, like, this random, this column with random numbers in but, yeah, there, oh, CRA S, is that the is that the CRA amount that's 226, okay, got it? Okay? I

Matthias Miller  11:49
have a feeling that there's some finessing that needs to happen. Somewhat finessing that needs to happen is something wrong with my everybody keeps asking me to repeat myself on my my headphone today.

Speaker 2  12:01
No, I didn't interpret the word finessing. It was an auditory dysfunction of my own nature. I often tell my wife, it's not that I didn't hear you, I just didn't understand you.

Matthias Miller  12:16
It's an atom on auditory dysfunction of my own nature.

Unknown Speaker  12:26
Auditory dysfunction of my own nature.

Matthias Miller  12:34
When I when I retire, I'm going to start multiple AI metal bands, and that

Unknown Speaker  12:41
doesn't sound like retirement,

Matthias Miller  12:44
and I think, I think it might have another band name or song name. I don't know which entrepreneurial dysfunction of my own nature. It just sounds like an awesome song, somehow

Unknown Speaker  12:55
that does. That would definitely be a heavy metal song. I

Unknown Speaker  13:05
Okay, well, for sure, okay,

Matthias Miller  13:09
but then we need to handle incurred security deposit,

Speaker 2  13:14
right? And you already have those as contracts,

Matthias Miller  13:19
so there's a balance, the security deposit balance, basically contract secure deposit, basically just take this amount here and create an entry row for it so

Matthias Miller  13:43
new macro.

Matthias Miller  13:50
Let's do this. I

Matthias Miller  14:28
Vamos a key, totes,

Unknown Speaker  14:44
contract and.

Matthias Miller  15:35
Which problem is okay?

Matthias Miller  15:47
And then We need the payments RG as well.

Matthias Miller  16:32
We're just going to really screw things up. Okay, so slightly complicated.

Matthias Miller  16:46
Go steal you're getting bored again, aren't you? No, okay, there's like literally nothing for you to do. We are going to add a invoice date.

Unknown Speaker  17:07
It's because you're so smart.

Matthias Miller  17:10
Contract IV silver RP, source, contract silver loom ID. We need this guy. I

Unknown Speaker  17:28
love it. I love it.

Matthias Miller  17:30
Spring, 00, update, match, first, unmatched, Rose, delete, Skip, delete, create new row. This guy equals false. The balloon ID is NA. I don't know why that would happen, but NuGet does, and then we need this guy, contract, i and b, RP, source, contract, silver limb, ID, string, this Guy, we support room, let me breathe. Match, first, delete, create new row. This guy becomes this guy and that guy and the inv itemization. Well, it's not right. That might that might work better. Thank you for checking up on me. Appreciate your current concern

Matthias Miller  18:56
under every payment date. Well, that's not right.

Matthias Miller  19:04
Let's just nuke you. We'll get back to you. And the other one we didn't like was

Matthias Miller  19:14
good. This one's the invoices. Is the primary care about you. Okay, what was it? I don't remember what it was. The sub it was, the subtotal, taxable invoice, taxable subtotal, non taxable subtotal, invoice itemization should be non Okay, let's find out where the subtitle comes from, a red subtitle. We ain't, we don't believe in forgiveness around here, all right, at least, at least not with

Speaker 2  19:51
validation. At least not with validation.

Matthias Miller  19:54
We don't believe validating and validating your forgiveness.

Unknown Speaker  20:04
Mean that that will keep some people thinking for a very long time.

Matthias Miller  20:11
Peter Gabe, is it valid?

Matthias Miller  20:18
Okay, what can we blow up this guy? Tax, city tax rate, what is what are you talking about?

Unknown Speaker  20:29
Sales tax.

Matthias Miller  20:33
Tax City is a required field. Well, we, I'm gonna guess that's not the city, just guessing.

Speaker 2  20:51
But I mean, it wouldn't be, well, what state was it? Was it Illinois?

Matthias Miller  20:58
Wait, we were pulling it out of the city. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  21:02
so I think, yeah. Okay,

Matthias Miller  21:04
that's city. That's right. Okay, so where are you losing your city, though, contract, invoice, tax, we need to set entry date this. Oh, fine, fine, Bob, it

Unknown Speaker  21:28
is kind of entertaining just listening to you talk,

Matthias Miller  21:34
because you have, seriously, nobody better to talk to. Sorry, I don't What

Unknown Speaker  21:40
did I say the other day? There's better news to listen to.

Matthias Miller  21:50
Not you contract link we want your Clicky. Clicky. What is your field?

Unknown Speaker  21:58
Name, voice, details, you,

Matthias Miller  22:03
you, you, you, you. Okay, so we're going to add you, and then we need to add we lost our sales tax columns. Rats, okay, so

Matthias Miller  22:26
a sales tax date, state rate, tax, county, county rate. Do you want? How do you want the sales tax information on these? Because do you want, if they're coming in, do you just want them under a bogus jurisdiction with 0% rates like we still have to put them in the state, but they're all non taxable, and you probably don't want to file them under you probably don't want to file them.

Unknown Speaker  22:59
So these are exempt contracts. This is just

Matthias Miller  23:07
bringing in payment history. We're planning to import them as non taxable because we're assuming that the tax is going to be handled elsewhere. Mm,

Speaker 2  23:25
oh, this was the conversation we had the other day about you do your switch on a on the beginning of a month so that your tax works out

Matthias Miller  23:32
Right, right. And my thought is, if we just put it under a bogus if we just put rates at zero under a bogus thing, all the imported stuff won't be taxable. And you just have to, at whatever point you do the switch wherever, whether it's beginning of the month or wherever you do it, you got to pull tax out of the old system,

Unknown Speaker  23:53
right? Yeah, yes.

Matthias Miller  23:59
Can we? Can we do a custom county and city for this stuff. That's like,

Speaker 2  24:08
Yeah, but the problem, the problem is, then, then the day we go live, then are we? Are we going to be stuck with not having direct tax rates. It would

Matthias Miller  24:21
just be on the invoice itself. The contract would have the right tax rate just on the invoice. We would stop in a bogus jurisdiction, so you know to exclude it when you go do your first violation here.

Speaker 1  24:30
Sure. Okay, that makes that makes sense. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  24:50
There you go. You use an imported

Unknown Speaker  24:54
tax jurisdictions,

Matthias Miller  24:59
the county that. That counties, that cities, that sales tax. Other is just other. It's going to be blank. Like who cares? So we have the state zero, imported zero, imported zero. Why did I copy all these things over? It sounded good in my head. Invoice, tax, state, state rate, city, city rate count,

Matthias Miller  25:47
T, count, other

Unknown Speaker  26:02
great, Okay,

Matthias Miller  26:05
you like me now, refresh you.

Unknown Speaker  26:16
Wait for it.

Matthias Miller  26:38
Invoice row ID is a required field

Matthias Miller  26:50
we should set the import ID, invoice, tax, amount, the sum should match the oh, well, that's good. Okay, fine, subtotal. Na, this guy should be zero to NA, why it would not be that, but just for fun, and this should be an NA, K, okay, and then we need the import thing on the

Unknown Speaker  27:27
sales tax,

Matthias Miller  27:30
the invoice contract, invoice contract,

Matthias Miller  27:44
import ID. Oh, we need to set this on The

Unknown Speaker  27:53
Administration.

Matthias Miller  28:01
All right, Will It Blend?

Matthias Miller  28:32
Tax rate. What are you talking about?

Unknown Speaker  28:39
Tax city,

Matthias Miller  28:43
okay, let's go down into our payments.

Unknown Speaker  28:55
Oh.

Unknown Speaker  29:02
Now, no

Matthias Miller  29:24
not getting it total so we

Matthias Miller  29:34
don't have a damage Weaver feet, really for your rent.

Matthias Miller  29:56
There's the rent. So we have a subtotal, cash, price, tax, amount, total and a balance. We have a payment. We don't have payments yet. Here's the invoice for that amount. So what do you hate about me, tax, city tax, rate,

Matthias Miller  30:32
tax, city, county and Rate. What

Matthias Miller  30:42
is it? This thing have existing rows? I

Matthias Miller  31:16
don't think Seth nuke the old data Like he was supposed to. I

Unknown Speaker  31:47
Okay. Seth.

Matthias Miller  32:01
Contract, no input file. I

Matthias Miller  33:02
Oh, Well, fine, I'm

Matthias Miller  33:28
fine now. Now, will you let me be destructive? Just give me a chance.

Speaker 2  33:40
Oh, man, I need to, I need to send you a hold on a second. You're, do you have Facebook, right? Yeah, hang on. I gotta send you something hilarious. And then you gotta watch this sometime, because this is,

Unknown Speaker  33:58
this is just cracked me up talking About being destructive.

Matthias Miller  34:06
Okay, it's now gonna reload you.

Unknown Speaker  34:19
Ah. We could exclude zero rows

Unknown Speaker  34:35
here. Let's do this. Ask this guy do this.

Matthias Miller  35:07
A line items, all right. String table,

Matthias Miller  36:05
or not. We're not actually filtering in there. I get it. It's

Matthias Miller  36:21
actually not do it there. So it's going to create problems. And we don't want problems. We believe in problems. Problems don't exist. Problems are just a big one of your imagination. You

Matthias Miller  36:51
you just imagine, well enough you can imagine a problem's wife, can you see yourself? No, it means it worked.

Unknown Speaker  37:24
Okay, I think we're close now by that, yes, sneaky little import,

Matthias Miller  37:46
oh no, this is gonna this is going to wildly, wildly, wildly screw up.

Unknown Speaker  37:55
But you always want to hear from your

Matthias Miller  38:01
doctor. Last time I tried this, yeah, just gonna wildly screw you up. Does anybody know where my scalpel went?

Matthias Miller  38:19
Okay, so I need this guy, this guy.

Unknown Speaker  38:23
Add Row,

Matthias Miller  38:26
string repeating groups, plus this plus that, this equals call that that needs a call in front. Yeah, now you like me better. Now I can be your friend. Okay? Richard Posey,

Unknown Speaker  38:48
he's still causing his problems.

Matthias Miller  38:51
No, he's just at the top of the list. He's not causing problems. He's a good old fellow.

Unknown Speaker  38:57
He's a jolly old fellow. He's a jolly old fellow.

Unknown Speaker  39:02
No, all right,

Matthias Miller  39:06
send it, man, send it.

Unknown Speaker  39:11
Eat it. Eat it.

Unknown Speaker  39:20
Please,

Matthias Miller  39:28
your vacuum we can't get under the table or what?

Speaker 2  39:31
This thing just does not do a good job. Oh, I was hoping it would it. This floor has these, like weld knobbins in it, and it just totally destroyed, like the little sealer silicone piece. And, anyway.

Unknown Speaker  40:07
Hi, bummer,

Unknown Speaker  40:30
University. They're just

Unknown Speaker  40:43
nothing works quite as good as a good old broom. I

Unknown Speaker  41:08
All right, look at that.

Matthias Miller  41:10
I don't know what screwed up, but, but man, we got a lot of stuff in. Look at that. Only 28 contracts, not in there.

Unknown Speaker  41:21
Thing of beauty. Yeah. Thing

Matthias Miller  41:23
a beauty. We don't have payments yet.

Unknown Speaker  41:28
Who needs payments? Yes, payments

Matthias Miller  41:36
are you okay if the first month rent collected? I mean, this is the obvious thing, but rent collect is going to be like a bajillion dollars the first you know, well, that's kind of what we're doing, right? Yeah. Okay, so Seth, can we please have an import ID for payment rows like we do for everything else. I

Matthias Miller  42:26
I just have it, not my stomach. Like, this can't be, actually this easy. Like, I mean, these customer deposits haven't gotten closed out. Let's pick Andrew. Your name is somewhat familiar. It's kind of weird that these guys keep surfacing.

Unknown Speaker  42:42
CRA contract.

Matthias Miller  42:54
The invoice date.

Speaker 2  42:56
Should we look this guy up and see what? See if it matches? Yeah,

Matthias Miller  43:05
why does he not have did we actually give him 45 extra days? I sure hope not. Well, we got visibility and reporting now,

Speaker 2  43:22
45 extra days. I mean, that's just a month, little over a month and a half, or just not quite a month. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  43:40
give me his contract number.

Matthias Miller  43:42
Contract number is 55257,

Unknown Speaker  43:49
and we say, we say that, how much did he pay so far? 814, 68,

Matthias Miller  44:02
contract eight. Voice, details, we said

Unknown Speaker  44:05
it's a thing of beauty, huh?

Matthias Miller  44:08
Sorry, what? 1468,

Speaker 2  44:10
contract, invoice, itemization, original, subtotal, 814, $68,000, CRA, although the purchase reserve isn't right, because I show a purchase reserve a, 925, 93 How do you come up with 1000

Unknown Speaker  44:28
Well, well,

Unknown Speaker  44:34
do the RP source data? You go

Matthias Miller  44:37
to the RP source data. We go down the

Unknown Speaker  44:41
bottom right, down the bottom right, down there to the right.

Matthias Miller  44:43
There we go, Wow, I can't, okay.

Speaker 2  44:47
Amount Paid down. Where is it? Scrolls these, down to these, 925, 93 were you coming up with? How do we get 1000 bucks? I don't know. Let's go figure that out.

Matthias Miller  44:59
I. Okay, so this is 5220, here. Let's do this. This guy, we will. I will find you rotten, but you can't hide.

Speaker 2  45:10
You can run, but you can't hide. Okay,

Matthias Miller  45:21
another one. I want, this guy, and RP, RP source data contracts silver loom ID equals this.

Unknown Speaker  45:36
That contract,

Matthias Miller  45:47
initial payment, contract to CRA contract, CRA amount. We don't actually want that. We just want. This is actually literally initial payment, I believe,

Matthias Miller  46:12
which is not what we want.

Matthias Miller  46:26
All right, let's see what he says in L

Matthias Miller  46:37
payment for CRA contract cash due, but we don't need a cash due. Cash due can be zero. See if it likes me. I don't say that about everyone, because some of them don't.

Matthias Miller  47:04
Okay, first of all, anybody, any, Nope, doesn't hate me. Okay, thank you for not hating me. Let's go so we have an initial payment of, I don't know where the initial payment is.

Speaker 2  47:19
Are we showing a negative 207, CRA details.

Matthias Miller  47:27
Let's go into here, right where you where you were. We incurred a CRA of negative where.

Speaker 2  47:35
Go back to details, contract details, oh, scroll downs, CRA amount, negative 207,

Matthias Miller  47:45
so I still need to put the $1,000 in Here. 861, 57 does it? Does it line up? No.

Matthias Miller  48:09
Siri mean amount. That's because the theory amount doesn't trend, the $1,000 doesn't translate correctly. CRA cash to CRA amount I want. I want to set the CRA amount. That's what I want to do. So this guy's CRA amount is 814, 68, so let's do 950, and 975, I said I want 814, 814, 814.

Matthias Miller  48:49
814. 68

Matthias Miller  48:57
Well, 956, 13 does it?

Matthias Miller  49:11
So Don't we need a way to import The CRA amount directly? Probably, I hopefully. I

Unknown Speaker  49:52
so we can just directly stop the CRA in. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  50:00
We could also just say the contract value, no, because that's not

Unknown Speaker  50:18
you could override the No, you can't do that.

Matthias Miller  50:26
I keep pretending I can do things that I can't. Either makes me delusional or useful and imaginative. Okay, so, and there's a fine line between the two, between the two. You make an argument that idealism is fundamentally delusional. Okay, so Contract Theory amount, maybe it is. What happens if you try to set it do? Well,

Matthias Miller  51:06
you really don't want me to find you.

Speaker 2  51:09
You really need to have when things fail. You really need to come up with, like, little animations for for things that break and fail and just like little balls of flame go rolling across your screen like you like, come on, people, we got to be entertained.

Matthias Miller  51:28
Enter initial payment. Oh, we have, okay, that's why.

Matthias Miller  51:37
Let's try setting it. Now, let's try previewing it. Now, I don't want new content. Oh, use thinker. I'm just

Matthias Miller  51:56
gonna go ahead and laugh at that, because I think that's kind of i

Matthias Miller  52:10
Oh, yeah, but I'm confused. CRA amount is

Matthias Miller  52:24
why is the contract?

Unknown Speaker  52:31
So, can you set the CRA? No,

Matthias Miller  52:32
it's not contract. CRA amount is getting the wrong thing. Contract. It's what, 25 Wait, what is the CRM? CRA amount? What CRA amount do you have

Unknown Speaker  52:42
for which

Matthias Miller  52:45
one? The Andrew,

Unknown Speaker  52:48
925, 93

Matthias Miller  52:54
So then, why is okay? So then let's go in here. Why is this one showing 861 and we had like an 814 60. Eight number somewhere. What am I smoking? That's the amount paid. Yeah. So the CRA amount is this? Why? Why is the CRA amount this? Why is it at nine? Something, something.

Matthias Miller  53:37
Well, there's one way to find out. Run the import. Did look at the record. Oh, fine. That was really smart. Thanks. I get that a lot. Okay.

Matthias Miller  53:58
CRA amount, the drink. Siri amount, oh, wait what? It didn't stick. Well, let's go move CRA amount down to Hmm.

Matthias Miller  54:25
Here. Do it after everything else. Now run, send it. Wait.

Speaker 2  54:32
Your columns are, there's a hierarchy of order.

Matthias Miller  54:36
Yeah, columns determine import order if you're if you're, if you're reading it from, I mean, if it's, if it's automatic, Jerry amount, but then there's the calcium out. Hey, Seth.

Matthias Miller  55:12
Okay, so then here show field information. See, you're a contract and net payment. Well, the issue is that we have a I mean,

Matthias Miller  55:28
but we don't care. Do we cash? Do? How is cash due? Getting set? What if we set cash due to, I don't know zero,

Matthias Miller  55:50
just for fun, or to say the CRA amount or zero.

Unknown Speaker  56:06
How's it getting set?

Matthias Miller  56:10
It's left over.

Matthias Miller  56:38
I didn't really just do why don't we just do this?

Matthias Miller  56:55
Just make it go away.

Matthias Miller  57:35
We have the period total so

Matthias Miller  57:43
does the contract have the monthly, the payment, that's just the payment. It doesn't have tax on it, or is it tax? No, it's not.

Matthias Miller  58:05
Okay, fine. What if we just did? Let's just try zero and see what it hates about us. I

Matthias Miller  58:21
didn't want to close that one. This is primary.

Matthias Miller  59:12
Mean, it just gets horribly confused. It's off by the monthly payment amount, whatever I mean, do I care? Not really. Should I not really

Unknown Speaker  59:29
that Cal come out, showing funky, yeah,

Matthias Miller  59:32
does is the payment? Is the monthly payment? Amount correct, without tax, monthly payment.

Speaker 2  59:38
Hold on. Let me look at this. This is still Andrew Daughtry, yep. 124, 35

Matthias Miller  59:49
124, 35 that's not right. Monthly payment. 207, Happened, asset, effective, value, contract, value,

Speaker 2  1:00:10
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What are you showing for an S? Okay, 30, okay. Contract, value, contract, oh, never mind. Yeah, 3050 Okay, wait,

Matthias Miller  1:00:28
but the contract value without tax, dropped down to 4602 it dropped from a

Matthias Miller  1:00:44
be total, a total only, okay, well, that's I'm so confused. I'm seeing two contract values. Contract value with tax, that's without tax, that's with tax, fine with tax, be that way. Okay. Well, how are you getting the contract? Value, then project value, value internal, monthly total, monthly subtotal, rent subtotal, CRA, monthly rent subtotal, bit of CRA, we take the arrest rental base. Booger bet what he's using. He's using the initial payment to calculate the CRA contract value. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:59
There's no bueno, no bueno.

Unknown Speaker  1:02:17
What is the county that you have on this guy? The

Matthias Miller  1:02:22
county Onondaga.

Unknown Speaker  1:02:28
What a name.

Matthias Miller  1:02:32
What a name. North Syracuse. Syracuse, yeah, wonder

Unknown Speaker  1:02:39
if we ought to make those fields a little bit wider. Yeah, that would be a good idea.

Matthias Miller  1:02:51
We could use more. I on.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:08
You booked my time from 330 to four.

Matthias Miller  1:03:11
You heard about that here.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:22
Okay? Smarty pants,

Speaker 2  1:03:29
but I'm sorry Liam was talking to you. What? What? Now,

Unknown Speaker  1:03:41
unusually high levels of SaaS going on over here. Okay, so,

Matthias Miller  1:03:48
if you have the CRA amount, calculate monthly payment. So we could conceivably cash, do contract, initial payment for the contract, if we would, we have the CRA amount, The monthly payment.

Matthias Miller  1:04:14
Is there enough stuff? GR, guaranteed replacement.

Matthias Miller  1:04:35
There's no way from here though that we can figure out, yes, we can.

Matthias Miller  1:04:51
This is whether it has dwf Do we just pull the dwf rate off of the i?

Unknown Speaker  1:05:06
The GRP, where is it?

Matthias Miller  1:05:10
Scrollsies, yeah, I mean the Yeah, contracts. GRP, whether this is whether it has it, though, right, right, actually, cavalcade, we just have the CRA amount.

Matthias Miller  1:05:35
Have the CRA amount, calculate the rent, rent based on cash price minus CRA amount. Add taxes and fees in and add that back To the CRA amount for the initial payment. Now.

Matthias Miller  1:07:00
Yeah, okay, well, let's not think about series yet. I think, I think we might need to clean some stuff up.

Matthias Miller  1:07:22
Do you? Do you agree with my statement here,

Unknown Speaker  1:07:26
which one

Matthias Miller  1:07:28
seer, CRA amount is really the critical value? Like to say, I want to buy a building, and here's $1,000 down. It's, it's, that's great to use to figure out the CRA amount. But CRA amount is really the critical value when it comes to like the contract,

Speaker 2  1:07:45
if you have a CRA amount, calculate the rent based on the cash price minus the CRA amount, correct, add taxes and fees and add that back to the CRA amount for the initial payment. Okay?

Matthias Miller  1:07:56
So if you have a $5,000 building, $1,000 CRA calculated monthly payment based on a $4,000 building, and then add that to the CRA amount for your initial payment.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:07
Boom, yes, for the initial pay. Okay, Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:21
Yeah, I agree. I concur.

Matthias Miller  1:08:39

Matthias Miller  1:09:19
has a security deposit. That's probably not right. Maybe it is. Let's go to the imports. Let's find somebody with a security deposit. So

Matthias Miller  1:09:42
a sky that's complete. Let's go to somebody who's open with a security deposit. Retrieval, probably also not good. EPO, also not good.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:58

that incumbent deposit table,

Matthias Miller  1:12:33
if it's I

Unknown Speaker  1:13:06
um,

Matthias Miller  1:13:25
we're just looking at the initial transaction, but really we should be looking at a sum of all their deposit or CRA amounts across time,

Unknown Speaker  1:13:36
right? Sounded intelligent.

Matthias Miller  1:13:39
X other GRP amount, okay, so and what is the other one we're excluding D and,
