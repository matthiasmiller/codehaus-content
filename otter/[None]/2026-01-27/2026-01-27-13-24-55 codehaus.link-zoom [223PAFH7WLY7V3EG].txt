Unknown Speaker  00:11
Yeah, man, hey, there, yo, yes,

Unknown Speaker  00:18
okay,

Unknown Speaker  00:22
Rick,

Unknown Speaker  00:27
all right, so we were going through handling of curve. Yes, sir, that up.

Unknown Speaker  00:36
We don't need linear feet handling anymore.

Unknown Speaker  00:44
I didn't send that over for pity sakes. Oh, do you still

Unknown Speaker  00:50
want to

Unknown Speaker  00:52
would you like to see that worksheet that I'm talking about? I would like to see it, in some sense, to make sure that I'm 100%

Unknown Speaker  01:01
Absolutely. There's no reason.

Unknown Speaker  01:10
Tina Murph, hey, do you have Matthias email address?

Unknown Speaker  01:20
Okay, I'll send one over to you.

Unknown Speaker  01:24
I need to or could you email me a copy of the cut the cheat sheet for lumber sizes with sawdust?

Unknown Speaker  01:40
Yes.

Unknown Speaker  01:42
Thank you, man, thank you very much.

Unknown Speaker  01:47
All right, she'll send it to me. I'll send it to you, hopefully that'll be real soon. Awesome. Bye.

Unknown Speaker  02:05
Yeah, so then I think that takes us through the raw material pricing,

Unknown Speaker  02:10
okay?

Unknown Speaker  02:13
And so if you have plywood in there, we won't add anything for plywood items here. We'll add that further down when we're adding up all the other material, additional materials,

Unknown Speaker  02:29
like fasteners and heat treating and plywood basically,

Unknown Speaker  02:33
okay.

Unknown Speaker  02:38
Okay, sawing then, and I don't know if this is okay, so going into sawing, we calculate the number of saws to find out the total board footage being processed,

Unknown Speaker  02:50
and multiply that out by the actual board footage. So what we had talked about, and I don't know this, is where it's still, where this is at. What did we had talked about was, I'm sorry, Matt, I'm not keeping up with your, your, your, okay, speed of your words, sorry. Alright, let's it's all good. Thanks for Thanks for hollering. So

Unknown Speaker  03:10
when something goes, let's say you have a piece of lumber that goes through the brewer and then goes through, I don't know, Ellen, l and m and

Unknown Speaker  03:21
like three, three different. So we so then we take, we take the board footage of the

Unknown Speaker  03:29
of the yield, theoretically. Now theoretically, this isn't 100% correct answer, but we take that and we multiply that out times three passes. And so when we look at overall sawing cost, the plan was, let's go look at let's look at all the orders for last year, whatever it was.

Unknown Speaker  03:51
Let's look at total volume processed installing that is, yeah, and let's then divide it out by that number, by that board footage, to figure out what it costs. What the board footage cost is for sawing.

Unknown Speaker  04:11
Now it doesn't handle there's a question, I lost you for I lost you for 20 seconds. There. Okay, so Internet, what is the

Unknown Speaker  04:26
should not be a problem.

Unknown Speaker  04:32
I don't know. Hopefully that won't happen again. Okay, you're saying

Unknown Speaker  04:38
all the all the song from last year. And then you believe it glitched. So then we would, we would use that number, we would use that board footage, the total volume processed on the saws, yeah. And we would use that to come up with the sawing number for the dollar per board foot. I.

Unknown Speaker  05:01
Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  05:03
based on hours and overhead, right? Based on how Yes, labor and overhead, yep. So Rick would come up with that number. We would come up with the total volume running through the saws, and

Unknown Speaker  05:18
that would be the basis. Then, going forward, we would use that number for any given item. How many passes? Is it?

Unknown Speaker  05:27
Times board footage, times you know, and add it all up and yeah, times the number,

Unknown Speaker  05:33
yeah. Now that does not get us.

Unknown Speaker  05:40
That does not get a super,

Unknown Speaker  05:44
super detailed as far as

Unknown Speaker  05:48
you know, price per saw, right gang saw pricing anything else like that, right?

Unknown Speaker  05:58
Right? I

Unknown Speaker  06:09
What are your thoughts?

Unknown Speaker  06:12
There was a list that we had of

Unknown Speaker  06:19
the Saul's I need this. I need to look at a saw list for some reason.

Unknown Speaker  06:30
Yeah, let's, let's go to it's under sawing,

Unknown Speaker  06:34
yeah, equipment, yeah. Let me go. I

Unknown Speaker  07:10
know, I'm still trying to find,

Unknown Speaker  07:16
man, there's a couple things I've been, you know, run by you. I

Unknown Speaker  07:21
of

Unknown Speaker  07:23
outside of this conversation, there to me, remember,

Unknown Speaker  07:29
I am,

Unknown Speaker  07:32
I don't know what I did with that one anyway. Well, brains dry, that was a random question.

Unknown Speaker  07:42
And

Unknown Speaker  07:47
you

Unknown Speaker  07:50
all

Unknown Speaker  08:01
right? Or four feet process, cost of one board feet. So that's for sawing and so then if,

Unknown Speaker  08:18
yeah, and I think we said, if it's any of the active items here,

Unknown Speaker  08:25
Allen M pendu, splitter, any can take Izzy Timmy, three hit, Single head, boring,

Unknown Speaker  08:34
boring machine

Unknown Speaker  08:40
bevel cut and D wall chop. Those are the three that we're separating,

Unknown Speaker  08:48
yep. Anyway, single head slaughter, saw rip, so in line, bandsaw, pointer

Unknown Speaker  08:56
chamfer. Those are, yeah, so that's so there, some may be faster or slower than others.

Unknown Speaker  09:08
Um,

Unknown Speaker  09:12
it's I do think,

Unknown Speaker  09:15
because I haven't thought through this in the last couple days or whatever.

Unknown Speaker  09:22
If we say

Unknown Speaker  09:24
price per pass

Unknown Speaker  09:28
is always the same, we charge for every pass through sawing, through SPC, sawing outside of those three oddities, outside of plywood, price per pass

Unknown Speaker  09:45
is always going to be the same regardless of which saw, which of those saws were you? I think that's a safe that's a safe way to go. So yes, not just for the sake of the track.

Unknown Speaker  10:00
In simplicity, but again, that's, I think that's safe.

Unknown Speaker  10:07
Okay, so now, but we are going good

Unknown Speaker  10:14
when we say price per pass

Unknown Speaker  10:18
one pass may be

Unknown Speaker  10:22
multiple. Like the bump and well, no, we took bump out of there, didn't we? We just said l and m.

Unknown Speaker  10:48
Sorry, what were you gonna say?

Unknown Speaker  10:56
No, go ahead. So so we do have to.

Unknown Speaker  11:07
How did we talk about

Unknown Speaker  11:10
how we're going to determine what is a pass? Okay? I guess so. Chamfer machine is definitely a pass through Bridgewood bandsaw.

Unknown Speaker  11:36
Good grief, man,

Unknown Speaker  11:38
yeah, we do wedges on that. And so to make a wedge, you have to pass it through on an angle. So that's a pass

Unknown Speaker  11:50
in line. Ripsaw is

Unknown Speaker  11:55
not going to count. Like if, yeah, we really need to break this down. Does that make sense?

Unknown Speaker  12:02
So you need to specify on a per saw basis whether it's a pass or not. I agree, yes. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  12:12
Do you want to do that now?

Unknown Speaker  12:16
No, I would prefer to add the field. Okay. Is there ever a time where

Unknown Speaker  12:25
it's a pass, if it's just one of the saws, but if it's both, it's not,

Unknown Speaker  12:33
yeah,

Unknown Speaker  12:37
so And is it

Unknown Speaker  12:43
um, I needed, let me dive into that a little more

Unknown Speaker  12:49
when I say that,

Unknown Speaker  12:58
yeah, because

Unknown Speaker  13:03
I'm trying to think of a combination where that happens. It happens, yes, it does l, l and m, and then band saw that needs to be one pass. So it's both, but it's one pass. So there's scenarios where it's two but one pass, yes, but if you would do like, but you might do just the L, M, or just the band saw,

Unknown Speaker  13:30
that is definitely possible. Yes, okay,

Unknown Speaker  13:35
that's this, well, just band saw, I don't anyway, but that's possible. I well, would the bandsaw always be with something else and still count and the other thing would counts to pass? Or

Unknown Speaker  13:54
do we need to look at item data to find that out? No, but so it's possible, like man, like

Unknown Speaker  14:03
I'm trying to think most like,

Unknown Speaker  14:08
almost without Phil if it goes through the three head band saw, or the one head

Unknown Speaker  14:17
if it goes through

Unknown Speaker  14:22
the one head band saw we're using for wedges. The three head band saw is much like the pendu splitter. The pendu splitter and the three head band saw

Unknown Speaker  14:35
do not have the ability to cut to length, so we have to cut it to length on another cut off saw, which could be L and M, could be cantek, could be Izzy's, could be timmys. Could be a

Unknown Speaker  14:50
gang saw

Unknown Speaker  14:52
Keystone or so is there six different, you know? I mean, there's a bunch of different cut off saws that could do the.

Unknown Speaker  15:00
The length lengthening, and then the three head band saw or the pendu splitter

Unknown Speaker  15:07
could do the the

Unknown Speaker  15:11
sizing, if you will.

Unknown Speaker  15:17
So

Unknown Speaker  15:21
I guess

Unknown Speaker  15:23
so.

Unknown Speaker  15:27
Is it. Do we penalize the customer because we put it on the LM to cut it to length, then we took it to the band, saw to slice it into boards when we could have ran it through the gang saw and done both in one pass.

Unknown Speaker  15:46
And are doing that a lot. I say no, so then we have to say l and m and three head bandsaw, or L and M and

Unknown Speaker  15:56
pendu splitter

Unknown Speaker  16:00
is one pass the combination is one pass

Unknown Speaker  16:06
bracket. So I think

Unknown Speaker  16:10
we need to, we actually Matt, we,

Unknown Speaker  16:15
yeah, we need to step away from the different saws for pricing,

Unknown Speaker  16:25
we need to price based on

Unknown Speaker  16:30
the material,

Unknown Speaker  16:35
based on

Unknown Speaker  16:37
what we have to do to prepare the material for the item. So rather than saying size or this, that and the other thing, we're just gonna say, oh, it's three dimensional. That's one pass notching, that's a second pass slotting, that's a second pass chamfering, that's a second pass. You know, I mean, and just, and based on what the item calls for, and not based on all of our solves,

Unknown Speaker  17:09
plus the specialty cuts.

Unknown Speaker  17:12
Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  17:16
there's a, I think there's a I

Unknown Speaker  17:26
there's a possibility we could call that another pass. But then, like, there's a few things we do on the boring machine. That's it's just crazy elaborate. So I think we have to separate, and at least separate the boring machine, um, the bevel cuts. We could probably just call that a pass, although they are more time consuming because they're angle cuts.

Unknown Speaker  17:57
Well, if we have to do one, then I mean, all right, one versus three is not a big difference. Zero versus one. So if we have to do one, let's do three. I mean, it doesn't matter.

Unknown Speaker  18:09
So then, how do we identify

Unknown Speaker  18:17
not teaching and slotting currently is identified in the miscellaneous prep or raw material one or the other.

Unknown Speaker  18:29
What did you say notching or slotting?

Unknown Speaker  18:32
Yeah, correct

Unknown Speaker  18:35
is not

Unknown Speaker  18:38
well. What is there that indicates Nachi chambering and slotting currently. Gotcha, you should, Okay, hang on, let me go back.

Unknown Speaker  18:59
Yeah, but you might not be able to get it out. It's in the maintenance

Unknown Speaker  19:04
room. You might have to use the petty bone the boom lift. Matthew is the boom lift? Yeah, um, Matt, so chamfering is we'll

Unknown Speaker  19:20
have to take this one step at a time, but if it's

Unknown Speaker  19:26
if it's chamfered, it's going to go through the chamfer machine

Unknown Speaker  19:30
period. If it's pointed, it has to go through the pointer period.

Unknown Speaker  19:40
If it's slotted,

Unknown Speaker  19:47
it either has to go through the slaughter saw or there are some things that we do. We slot them on the size or the

Unknown Speaker  19:58
brewer the key.

Unknown Speaker  20:00
Stone have the ability to do slotting at the same time as in, right in the gangsaul, um, and in that occasion it would somewhere, we would say, slot, slaughter, slotted, slotting, s, l, o, t is going to be somewhere in that recipe.

Unknown Speaker  20:21
Yep.

Unknown Speaker  20:23
So chamfer is going to be in the recipe point is going to be in the recipe

Unknown Speaker  20:30
slot is going to be in the recipe

Unknown Speaker  20:36
bevel

Unknown Speaker  20:38
is going to be somewhere in that recipe or angle.

Unknown Speaker  20:46
Okay, are these all for, for the sizers, it's what, um, no,

Unknown Speaker  20:51
angle and bevel are all going through the saw, right?

Unknown Speaker  20:55
Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  20:56
point,

Unknown Speaker  20:58
chamfer, bevel, angle. Or

Unknown Speaker  21:05
hole like for drilling holes, drill holes, holes gets drilled. Sometimes they rate gets drilled, gets drilled.

Unknown Speaker  21:16
Brosky

Unknown Speaker  21:21
drill real.

Unknown Speaker  21:24
I'm trying to think like I'm looking at thinking of our item data. Here we go again, right? Like,

Unknown Speaker  21:40
George you copy.

Unknown Speaker  21:47
I'm gonna say,

Unknown Speaker  21:54
Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  21:59
busy signal.

Unknown Speaker  22:06
Hey, bud, my radio's not letting me talk. Are you able to stop at a conference room when you have a minute?

Unknown Speaker  22:18
Thanks,

Unknown Speaker  22:21
my I'm gonna start back. Chamfer

Unknown Speaker  22:26
is in the recipe. Point is in the recipe as a thaw

Unknown Speaker  22:35
well or somewhere else it's it's gonna go to the pointer. But sorry, what did you say? Is it in the saw, or is it noted in the raw material or somewhere else, or miscellaneous prep? Oh, is it always the saw?

Unknown Speaker  22:57
If it gets chamfered, it's going to it's going to go to the saw the chamfer machine. If it gets pointed, it's going to go to the state pointer. If it gets bevel caught,

Unknown Speaker  23:12
that can happen a couple different ways. Bevels and angles can happen a couple different ways. It's not we don't have a bevel saw, or an angle saw?

Unknown Speaker  23:23
Okay,

Unknown Speaker  23:25
we have this fancy thing called bevel cuts that we kind of made up, I guess dog on it, but

Unknown Speaker  23:33
it's not actually a saw. I get it right, right? I

Unknown Speaker  23:43
so if it gets this where it starts to break down eight,

Unknown Speaker  23:57
the only way to tell if it gets slotted is if

Unknown Speaker  24:09
either in,

Unknown Speaker  24:11
I guess in miscellaneous prep,

Unknown Speaker  24:18
it says the word s, l, o, t, in one

Unknown Speaker  24:22
form or another. Could say slot slaughter, slotted, slotting, but it's going to be in that miscellaneous prep.

Unknown Speaker  24:40
Is that too is something like that too complicated? Matt, like, should we rather?

Unknown Speaker  24:48
Should we rather have a recipe and the item data?

Unknown Speaker  24:55
Just check the box for this, this, this, this and that, and the other thing. And then.

Unknown Speaker  25:09
Or is it, you know what? I mean?

Unknown Speaker  25:12
Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  25:26
I mean, you can go either way. I mean, slotting is the kind of thing that

Unknown Speaker  25:32
it's very

Unknown Speaker  25:41
some words are have a lot of variations. If we just literally look for the word slot in whatever forms,

Unknown Speaker  25:51
then that's

Unknown Speaker  25:54
well, can you look in the entire

Unknown Speaker  25:58
does it have to be in one specific model. Or can you just look at the entire item, all the item data?

Unknown Speaker  26:06
It would be the, I mean, it's, it's the sizer, the sizer in info, the, well,

Unknown Speaker  26:16
it's really all

Unknown Speaker  26:18
the, all the raw material and miscellaneous prep for anywhere,

Unknown Speaker  26:27
yeah, any of the raw material miscellaneous prep sections should say that

Unknown Speaker  26:34
is that.

Unknown Speaker  26:36
Does that make it easy enough for you to detect it, yeah, I think it's fine,

Unknown Speaker  26:43
okay? And the same thing with bevel,

Unknown Speaker  26:48
that would just be the word bevel, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  26:52
and the same thing with the word,

Unknown Speaker  26:56
if something gets angle cut,

Unknown Speaker  27:04
but if it gets angle cut, right? We don't have an angle cutter, but if it gets angle, we'll drop some but if it happens somewhere in that window, that item data, you're going to write the word angle somewhere. Am I right?

Unknown Speaker  27:23
You're going to say you're

Unknown Speaker  27:25
going to put diagonal, no blue on the vehicle.

Unknown Speaker  27:32
Cutting Corners, like, for instance, fairway gets corner cut one end. That's one of the single head. What do you call that? Corner cut? What about bevel when is it bevel cut? That's that's going the opposite direction. So we have bevel cuts, animal cuts, corner cuts and diagonal level, diagonal and corner cuts, the three items we have

Unknown Speaker  27:57
so that angles are be well chopped,

Unknown Speaker  28:00
bevels, bevel and if it's corners cut, it's on, well, we do corners cut on,

Unknown Speaker  28:08
on the D wall, chop saw, I guess we'll do on the deal, or chops all the time. How long it is, which we get so long, like, look for incense, like the far away, you're not going to do that on do it all, tops off this 620 inches long,

Unknown Speaker  28:25
96 I understand we're trying to figure out for pricing when it has a corner cut, diagonal bevel angle,

Unknown Speaker  28:39
those things. So the way that we're going to say yes that happens on that item is by looking at miscellaneous prep windows, raw material, those windows to look for those specific words.

Unknown Speaker  28:56
So the question is,

Unknown Speaker  28:59
if it gets slotted or goes to the slaughter or whatever. Somewhere it's going to say s, l, o, t in your description.

Unknown Speaker  29:09
Somewhere it's going to say chamfer in your description. Or are you just going to send it to the chamfer machine and not write chamfer? Somewhere,

Unknown Speaker  29:21
something, champion. It's gonna either it's chamfer goes to the chamfer machine, but if it's coming off the size, or it's gonna say to chamfer in the size for miscellaneous product,

Unknown Speaker  29:34
sure, if we just include the saw names in that. So you just look at saw names, raw material and miscellaneous prep that that'll do it. There you go. Perfect. Chamfer point, slot, bevel angle.

Unknown Speaker  30:00
Diagonal

Unknown Speaker  30:03
cut corners, or corners cut is it always the same corner? Can't we just do corner? Would you ever use corner in any other context?

Unknown Speaker  30:16
Well, sometimes some runners, like we do cut corners on all four sides. Some corners we cut just on one side. And then sometimes one corner is just one end. So there's a there's a lot of variables there.

Unknown Speaker  30:32
So in that you would need a quantity,

Unknown Speaker  30:35
right?

Unknown Speaker  30:38
I think we're doing that. These guys put that window somewhere, but I forget. I think that's bevel cuts. I think you put that

Unknown Speaker  30:47
for how many belts? Yeah, going. So we would really need one for corners cut, bevel cut and diagonal cut.

Unknown Speaker  30:56
Which diagonals we do both ends most times. I'm thinking there might be one or two that I don't know. I don't think we have them anymore.

Unknown Speaker  31:06
I would say all three we need. We need the same thing

Unknown Speaker  31:11
for some for simplicity,

Unknown Speaker  31:16
but it's going to take Miller to cut all four corners. That's clean energy, right?

Unknown Speaker  31:23
That's 222, diagonals. But for simplicity, in the calculator, Matt,

Unknown Speaker  31:30
oh man,

Unknown Speaker  31:34
like it. It takes longer to do four, but the bulk of the time is in the setup and the scheduling and actually doing it, and counting the pieces and sorting the pieces and putting a couple other like, that's, you know,

Unknown Speaker  31:52
like, I don't, it doesn't really matter if, no, it does, but it, you know, I mean, for simplicity, maybe we should just say, hey, the runners get corners cut for the and that just brace them all for

Unknown Speaker  32:09
that's up to you. I'm thinking about this. I'm Well, Matt, how

Unknown Speaker  32:15
sorry. I think of this a little bit like, I don't know, excuse the violent comparison, but it's the heat sinking is heat seeking missile, which means, on some things, I think for a period of time, we just about have to use broad averages, just like

Unknown Speaker  32:39
I suspect with pricing, we'll have multiple levels of heat. Well, let me say this a heat seeking missile or something like that, starts with, you know, you have a broad general direction, and as you get closer and closer, you can dial in and get more specific. I think, I think that's the comparison I'm trying to make here is,

Unknown Speaker  33:02
I think it would be, in my opinion, it would be wise to figure out what is good enough for the next iteration of pricing, and then,

Unknown Speaker  33:13
as we get more data on, what does it actually cost on, you know, exactly On bubble cuts. Once we have a year of sawing data, it's going to look a lot different. To try to dial that in and get more specific on that pricing. Look, man, I'll show you this. Look at

Unknown Speaker  33:35
that. That's awesome. Heat Seeking Missile right there.

Unknown Speaker  33:41
That's exactly right.

Unknown Speaker  33:44
I'm going to just click, for George's sake, what I'm my brain saying George is the

Unknown Speaker  33:53
way we charge if we want to be really, really solid right away with sawing cost.

Unknown Speaker  34:05
We charge people for every pass through a saw.

Unknown Speaker  34:10
So we know that on a gang saw, we cut it to length, we cut the edge and

Unknown Speaker  34:17
the width, the height and the length is on a gang saw, so if we go to the L and M and then the Ripper planer, or if we go to the L and M then the three head band saw, that's two different steps, but we can do the same thing on a gang saw. So I'm not going to charge a customer because, oh, sorry, we cut your lumbar on the L and M and three head I might charge customer for one pass, gainsaw pricing

Unknown Speaker  34:44
for that piece of the puzzle, if it gets notched, the boards aren't going to get notched, but the runners are going to get notched. That's going to be a second pass, chamfered, third pass slotted. Fourth, pointed. Fifth.

Unknown Speaker  35:00
If angles six pass, so every size of lumber that goes through another thing is going to get charged another pass. For simplicity sake.

Unknown Speaker  35:14
If we can start with that math, let's stick with that, and it's going to it's going to give us a really good.

Unknown Speaker  35:22
Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  35:24
And then there's going to be exceptions. When we dial in the price and we're like, you know, this thing does have 17 holes and, you know, five angles and all that, and we're just going to be like, Jack the price a little bit more. I think you can do that for the most part. That catches a lot of it. Does that make sense? George, okay,

Unknown Speaker  35:47
so,

Unknown Speaker  35:50
chamfer point slot, bevel angle, diagonal, cut, corners, corners cut.

Unknown Speaker  36:01
Would you ever use the word corner in this I mean, can we just look for corner? Yeah, okay.

Unknown Speaker  36:13
Like collars. Do they say anything about corner, George and the item data? Should I look? No,

Unknown Speaker  36:23
and then, and then,

Unknown Speaker  36:25
the last one was used metal corners. But that's not in the items. That's an old thing.

Unknown Speaker  36:33
What if it's not part of it? Bridgewood bandsaw. What about that?

Unknown Speaker  36:41
Because you do some goofy every once in a while, and be saddles and stagnant saddles, diagonals, wedges,

Unknown Speaker  36:51
you got multiple stuff there.

Unknown Speaker  36:57
If it goes

Unknown Speaker  36:58
we could add up. We could add a pass anytime it we use the multiplier.

Unknown Speaker  37:06
Well, actually, we don't know.

Unknown Speaker  37:09
Do we No? Not necessarily. That's not going to be a No, sure, but it's like chamfer machine is a pass. Stake pointer is a pass. Bridgewood band saw is a pass.

Unknown Speaker  37:21
We're not going to run through any of those three machines, unless we have to

Unknown Speaker  37:28
for some special thing

Unknown Speaker  37:32
that could be three passes gang saw

Unknown Speaker  37:36
verciser

Unknown Speaker  37:38
West shot saw out there, cut it to length, if it's short, and then virtual and so you may have, so that's three passes Well, and that's okay, let's get to that. But

Unknown Speaker  37:54
the other one I wanted to

Unknown Speaker  37:56
was the drilling the holes, George, we didn't get that one if you drill, if it gets drilled or a hole,

Unknown Speaker  38:06
does it always go to the boring machine?

Unknown Speaker  38:15
Yeah, because monsters get drilled, but they do that by hand,

Unknown Speaker  38:20
so it doesn't always go to the boring machine. That's,

Unknown Speaker  38:25
yeah, but I don't have that task going. I don't have a test. Well, no, no, that goes, that goes into the fastener prop. That's fastener, because that's part of the installing the carriage bolt, or the lags or but everything else goes. If you have a piece of lumber that needs a hole drilled in it, shoot that doesn't, that doesn't apply always, does it? Do you you pre drill some things that get lags, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  38:58
or time that time at but for you can't New Holland because it's too big,

Unknown Speaker  39:04
right? New Holland's up to 105,

Unknown Speaker  39:08
but then monsters, you monster, you can. You would if you could. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  39:15
that's 130 points.

Unknown Speaker  39:20
Well,

Unknown Speaker  39:32
that's okay. We have to pay, we have to we have to account for that in our we just have to account for that. But you're putting how many holes you correct? Well, we were talking about, yes, I think I have a couple in there that I put in so far, okay, yes, yes. Got back to the repair page, yes, we, we wanted to charge that George, specifically, specifically, how many.

Unknown Speaker  40:00
Holes are drilled. So how do we know if it got if the item has holes? We can't just say oh, it's on the boring machine or Oh, it's not on the boring machine. It's going to say, is it going to say, gets drilled or drill, or is it going to say hole or holes,

Unknown Speaker  40:23
the

Unknown Speaker  40:25
drill,

Unknown Speaker  40:27
drill, the D, R, I, L, L, word is going to be, and then you're putting in the number right now,

Unknown Speaker  40:36
well, not to go in the repair ship or wherever it is going to them in each one it gets filled and put. Yes, that was the window after the fact, after the item selection. Yeah, so you gotta go back in and clean that up. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  40:54
wait.

Unknown Speaker  40:57
You mean, go back through and see it's existing. I don't put anything. I mean, if it's new no to drill. I've been putting numbers on there,

Unknown Speaker  41:06
like 77 halves for New Holland, thin size for New Holland.

Unknown Speaker  41:11
6880 sixes, front legs, rear legs. You putting the number holes? I gotta go into the system and change and put how many holes in each one of them, you should. We should do that then on, like the monsters, too, then,

Unknown Speaker  41:28
then it's accounted for.

Unknown Speaker  41:30
That's no different than

Unknown Speaker  41:33
cuz we're going to the boring machine, right?

Unknown Speaker  41:39
So the word D, R, I, L, L, What category would that be under? Then, just size. Or where would you put that under size? Or

Unknown Speaker  41:48
because I don't have a production category, I need a production category to go and do that. I

Unknown Speaker  42:03
Hey, I got another quickie Matt while we're about,

Unknown Speaker  42:12
yeah, and sorry.

Unknown Speaker  42:16
Oh, there's the print. Look at that.

Unknown Speaker  42:19
Let's go

Unknown Speaker  42:22
nuts. Go great. We got

Unknown Speaker  42:26
a holes.

Unknown Speaker  42:28
Where's your holy moly? Is it

Unknown Speaker  42:32
in here? When you click on the

Unknown Speaker  42:35
no, because you're going through, you're going through the three and a half, the six, 134, three and a half. 646, an inch and 13, five and a half. So you'd have to drill a row. It's four, 812, holes. But where are you doing the whole quantities on here? There's that's why I say there's not a place to put it. If it's on production,

Unknown Speaker  42:56
there's not a category, is it? When you when it goes to boring machine. Is that? What is that? Russia shows up.

Unknown Speaker  43:13
So are they?

Unknown Speaker  43:15
George? When you say production, are they drilling this in assembly? Then

Unknown Speaker  43:20
you can't hear. What's that? Oh, sorry, on the production side, are they drilling it in the assembly them then? Or how does that work? Yes, yes, yes, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  43:32
Why wouldn't we add, why wouldn't we add a raw material at the end? That's just

Unknown Speaker  43:38
production, production drilling, or something,

Unknown Speaker  43:42
quantity. Yeah, that's right. And where would that be located in the items list, the down raw materials list, in this list here, all right,

Unknown Speaker  43:54
this is where you're going to find plywood. Is where you see heat trading, is where all the fasteners

Unknown Speaker  44:01
additional costs. Yeah, it's good, Matt, it's like that material, yeah, just guys changed it. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  44:13
roll with the punches, baby.

Unknown Speaker  44:17
Matt.

Unknown Speaker  44:19
Matt, yeah, man, after my own horror, you're eating, good job. Is

Unknown Speaker  44:26
that sweet tea?

Unknown Speaker  44:29
No, he's from Kansas, man, dude, I would, but I don't. I drink, I drink hot tea, but not I don't do much of the sweet tea. Matt's from Kansas. I don't know what cannabis drinks,

Unknown Speaker  44:45
horrible, unsweetened black tea, sweet, awful.

Unknown Speaker  44:52
Back to I only go back to the items

Unknown Speaker  44:57
I.

Unknown Speaker  45:02
Alright. So then

Unknown Speaker  45:04
go ahead. No, go ahead.

Unknown Speaker  45:08
So if there's the word drill in it,

Unknown Speaker  45:12
then we really should make sure it either goes to the boring machine or we have that item in the raw material.

Unknown Speaker  45:20
Yes. And then also, if you have, if

Unknown Speaker  45:29
you send it to the slaughter, saw, we should make sure that you've got slots somewhere in there,

Unknown Speaker  45:35
etc, yes,

Unknown Speaker  45:38
okay.

Unknown Speaker  45:40
And then if you have it,

Unknown Speaker  45:48
if you send it to the boring machine and you have production drilling, is that okay? Is production drilling what you want to call it, or what do you want to call

Unknown Speaker  45:57
it? I would say product, some type of production assembly, assembly assembly, drone, assembly, drilling, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  46:06
Okay. What happens if you have, sorry, I'm trying to keep assembly and sawing in two separate categories. Yeah, I like it for the last three years.

Unknown Speaker  46:17
Well, I think, I think it's, it's, yeah, technically, either all production in some capacity.

Unknown Speaker  46:24
So

Unknown Speaker  46:27
if you have boring machine and assembly drilling

Unknown Speaker  46:30
set, a problem that's going to be that's going to be on the time that, because I pre drill holes for time at but then when they take it the assembly station, they gotta drill another pilot hole, just for splitting purposes that. So you're gonna be rolling, yeah, it's gonna be both at same time. No Matt, that's fine, because we're gonna catch every hole somewhere. Yep, yep. Job.

Unknown Speaker  47:07
All right, I think I got it. I'll take a crack at it.

Unknown Speaker  47:12
Bridgewood band saw.

Unknown Speaker  47:15
What does that do? Which one of these does that cover?

Unknown Speaker  47:23
Ridgewood band saw is, yeah, it's going to be some kind of weird, Goofy, like we have done like, like radiuses on pieces of oak. We have done like, we have carved stuff. We've taken blocks and split them diagonally, just like we do on the single head band saw. But that is a

Unknown Speaker  47:47
that is a machine of its own, again, like chamfer machine state pointer, Bridgewood bandsaw.

Unknown Speaker  47:57
Okay, so with the Bridgewood bandsaw, though, if, if it says something like diagonal somewhere,

Unknown Speaker  48:05
and it says Bridgewood bandsaw,

Unknown Speaker  48:08
how many passes is that

Unknown Speaker  48:12
one?

Unknown Speaker  48:15
So do we with Bridgewood bandsaw? Do we always make sure it's at least one additional pass, and because we're looking for these different words in here to

Unknown Speaker  48:27
indicate passes that we might not catch otherwise. So the way I'm following you now, a lot of the blocks that we cut on the

Unknown Speaker  48:37
cantek and sawing then we send it to the Bridgewood. Would that count as two passes? Are you just talking when you cut it into chops? Yeah, into Bridgewood? Yeah, yeah. Let's talk about the canteen after but Matt, when anytime it's going to be anytime you're cutting a chalk? George,

Unknown Speaker  48:59
it's a pass. But that's another word that we have to look for, right? Is chalk.

Unknown Speaker  49:05
Chalk is also a pass. Chalk, chalk, V cuts, saddles.

Unknown Speaker  49:14
I think that's the three. There you go. There's three more words, Matt,

Unknown Speaker  49:19
okay, do

Unknown Speaker  49:26
it as long as, as long as bridge woods in there, because I do chalks on the baker one too. So the identification would be if you see chalk Bridgewood, because I do chalks on an upcuts all and I do chalks on the baker one.

Unknown Speaker  49:48
Help me. Help me understand how that translates to passes you mean chalks

Unknown Speaker  49:55
because chalks is a square.

Unknown Speaker  50:00
A piece that is square is three dimensional, and we're taking it and cutting it from corner to corner, yep.

Unknown Speaker  50:11
And make so

Unknown Speaker  50:13
do we? Do? We look at the

Unknown Speaker  50:26
I'm still a little unclear how to fully get the right thing on

Unknown Speaker  50:35
the bridge would,

Unknown Speaker  50:37
because some of the stuff we could pick up on the

Unknown Speaker  50:41
off of these keywords that we're looking for,

Unknown Speaker  50:46
but you also want to avoid counting it twice.

Unknown Speaker  50:52
No, that's fine. What do you only you do on the bridge with George is either a diagonal or a

Unknown Speaker  51:02
would you say

Unknown Speaker  51:04
diagonal,

Unknown Speaker  51:06
V cuts, V cut, chops and saddles, chalk saddle or radius.

Unknown Speaker  51:19
That is a sound so, but are you going to call it sound?

Unknown Speaker  51:26
So can we just say that if you have the branius, it don't matter. I'm not asking you change it. No, no. Well, I'm just wondering if that keyword, that word, is in there. I don't care

Unknown Speaker  51:41
what's that, Matt, could we just require that if you use the bridge with that you have one of those words in in there somewhere, so that we know what it is?

Unknown Speaker  51:54
Yes, okay, do

Unknown Speaker  52:03
Yeah, and then V cut, do you put a space in there?

Unknown Speaker  52:12
What you lost me, what on the, on the on the V cuts? How do you type that out? Or do you have an Yeah, yeah. I just, I just put V, I think it's V space cuts. And we don't, if we cut the V cuts and radiuses or saddles, I don't do that. I haven't did that for quite a while.

Unknown Speaker  52:32
So much with any of them. It's still in where we, you know, in the prints that we pulled so far,

Unknown Speaker  52:39
sure.

Unknown Speaker  52:41
So now chalks and what was the other ones that I said?

Unknown Speaker  52:49
Saddles, saddles, yeah, yeah, saddles and V cuts. I don't do that often. Now, chalks and

Unknown Speaker  52:58
diagonals I do. I

Unknown Speaker  53:09
go, yep.

Unknown Speaker  53:12
Matt,

Unknown Speaker  53:14
have a question, then sure in the item data, could you

Unknown Speaker  53:22
well? How are you going to show

Unknown Speaker  53:29
when we actually look at a price of an item? We're going to look very specifically into the item data.

Unknown Speaker  53:38
Imagine, right? So

Unknown Speaker  53:42
all these keywords that we just talked about, would you show a?

Unknown Speaker  53:48
Would you create a window for

Unknown Speaker  53:52
maybe sawing passes,

Unknown Speaker  53:56
like your raw materials window, or that kind of thing, and then, and then show each one that we're

Unknown Speaker  54:05
that we're

Unknown Speaker  54:07
connecting to this item to specific, yeah, so I think what I was planning to do, okay, pricing is

Unknown Speaker  54:16
extensive enough that I was going to plan to have a separate screen that shows you the full pricing breakdown. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  54:25
I just don't know how to, I mean, it's just so much stuff.

Unknown Speaker  54:31
And then I could on the I would do it on the lumber row for each piece of lumber, you would see how many passes and what the passes are. I was and then, yes, I was thinking about

Unknown Speaker  54:45
naming these passes so that you can see exactly what passes are used on which line item.

Unknown Speaker  54:54
Yeah, you just see a list.

Unknown Speaker  55:01
Um,

Unknown Speaker  55:04
I'm sure down the road we're going to keep but when we're if we're doing new design, or yes, we're doing new design, I'm looking at what this one I pulled up right now, I'm seeing,

Unknown Speaker  55:20
I mean, that's showing, it's showing the the item right there, that's 2d view. We don't have 3d on here.

Unknown Speaker  55:30
But the only thing that's special is this little notch here, which

Unknown Speaker  55:35
it's saying ends notched. You.

Unknown Speaker  55:43
Um,

Unknown Speaker  55:45
if I have to scroll through this lumber page to see those things,

Unknown Speaker  55:51
that's, yeah, I guess I don't know. Maybe I'm just saying the viability of this item page is kind, I kind of do like the item page

Unknown Speaker  56:03
as a great window to the item.

Unknown Speaker  56:10
If I saw a box here somewhere, I would

Unknown Speaker  56:15
like, I can go down here raw materials. I can see all raw materials. Sure, right after that, if I could see the

Unknown Speaker  56:22
sewing passes, and I'd quickly be I'd see, oh yeah, sizer and notching, yep. So would you want to see the lumber dimensions and, like, no, or just, just all the paths, just the list of the passes. That's it. Yeah. Do you want the number of times that he passed? Like three, you know, notching three times, or just again, just the passes. It's just gonna be one, yeah, just, just,

Unknown Speaker  56:55
yeah, just to pass.

Unknown Speaker  56:59
I mean, if that's that's fine. That's easy.

Unknown Speaker  57:03
Okay, so the Armstrong

Unknown Speaker  57:08
G Ip, that's going to be five passes,

Unknown Speaker  57:12
okay, because you got cutting on the brewer or cutting on the Keystone,

Unknown Speaker  57:18
and you run it four times through the notcher. What's that 76 by 52

Unknown Speaker  57:25
what should we call the pass? I'm assuming we're we're going to assume a pass if it's not a two by not plywood, or if it's rough cut. We're going to assume a sizing pass regardless whether it actually runs through the size. Or is that right?

Unknown Speaker  57:48
Three dimensional piece of lumber is it is an automatic pass,

Unknown Speaker  57:56
right? You

Unknown Speaker  58:03
well, except two buys are no

Unknown Speaker  58:06
even, even with two, even using two bites, you would assume an automatic pass, yeah. I mean, we have to,

Unknown Speaker  58:13
yeah, yeah. We have to cut them to length,

Unknown Speaker  58:17
right? Well, some plywoods, two passes,

Unknown Speaker  58:22
plywood. Is an interesting conversation here, too. Yeah, because I've cut it down at the barn, that's one pass, and I bring it up here, and either bevel one edge

Unknown Speaker  58:32
might cut it on the cut off, saw to small, tiny pieces, that'd be two second pass. Yeah, so that has, it's like, a lot of times, it's just one pass. Sometimes, if I have to drill, or sometimes we drill it by them, having them for a while. Well, we're, we're taking, we're planning, are we? We're still planning to

Unknown Speaker  58:53
enter in the raw material window,

Unknown Speaker  58:57
the number of pieces for each

Unknown Speaker  59:01
item

Unknown Speaker  59:04
for the plywood. For plywood,

Unknown Speaker  59:07
we're not

Unknown Speaker  59:11
we don't have a system in place to track how many different cuts we had to make, how many times we had to break that down, how small We had to slice the pieces?

Unknown Speaker  59:24
Yeah, we don't

Unknown Speaker  59:32
do

Unknown Speaker  59:51
i but does does it matter?

Unknown Speaker  59:54
I guess it matters. Well,

Unknown Speaker  59:59
plywood.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:00
And tell me if I'm wrong, it seemed, it would seem, to me, working with plywood, that you're getting into

Unknown Speaker  1:00:07
whole other

Unknown Speaker  1:00:11
amounts of work and other types of things then, like, that's a different scale than

Unknown Speaker  1:00:19
but maybe not.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:34
Difference? Oh,

Unknown Speaker  1:00:39
I'm just trying to think like

Unknown Speaker  1:00:42
the smaller Okay, let's just say we're building a tiny little box, six inches by six inches by six inches. And it's a 3d box. It has 123456,

Unknown Speaker  1:00:54
pieces of plywood that are six by six.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:58
Yep.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:00
And we charge the customer for the six by six pieces of six by six plywood and and it's not a lot of board feet, so the prices,

Unknown Speaker  1:01:12
well, it doesn't take a lot out of a piece of plywood, right? It's only, good grief, it's less than 10% of a piece. So that's a lower price,

Unknown Speaker  1:01:23
then we send it over to assembly, but assembly has certain amount of fasteners, the overall size isn't very big.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:36
Then we price it with overhead and everything else we're I don't know, I think, go ahead. Well, okay, I guess I'm thinking, or what if we build a box? It's eight by eight by eight. How many eight foot by foot by eight foot. Now you take six by six by six inches. You could fit hundreds of them things inside of that eight by eight by eight box takes a whole lot lower to make all them little six inch boxes.

Unknown Speaker  1:02:10
Do we have to capture it on the sawing side, or are we going to capture it somewhere else?

Unknown Speaker  1:02:16
What were you going to say?

Unknown Speaker  1:02:18
Well, it seems to me like, okay, fundamentally, with lumber, it's very easy to tell what

Unknown Speaker  1:02:30
it's to count the passes. But with plywood, because, because there you're generally just working in

Unknown Speaker  1:02:38
in a

Unknown Speaker  1:02:40
single dimension. I mean, you're saying

Unknown Speaker  1:02:44
we're figuring out how many of these pieces can come out of a can't or something like that, but that's, that's the extent of it. With with plywood, then you're dealing with

Unknown Speaker  1:03:00
random sizes. You're not just dealing with lengths out of lengths. You're dealing with length and width out of a larger thing. I'm going to think by the very definition, you're also going to have to,

Unknown Speaker  1:03:11
straight up specify how many passes plywood actually is.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:19
Maybe I'm well,

Unknown Speaker  1:03:33
how are you gonna if you if you say plywood is one pass

Unknown Speaker  1:03:39
and you price it

Unknown Speaker  1:03:42
by the piece, plus a sewing number.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:47
And we said the job takes three pieces, it would take three times whatever number we come up with. If we say it takes,

Unknown Speaker  1:03:56
that's not breaks down if we say it takes a quarter piece.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:02
I don't know. Where can we put it? How can we bake a multiplier into it without

Unknown Speaker  1:04:10
pouring over the prints and figuring out how many inches of cuts we're actually doing?

Unknown Speaker  1:04:15
That would be that the best way to do it would figure out how many inch Well,

Unknown Speaker  1:04:21
I don't know

Unknown Speaker  1:04:25
passes.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:28
Well, could we would it help to come up with a list of passes that? Naming the passes that you would use on plywood is that helpful?

Unknown Speaker  1:04:37
Probably,

Unknown Speaker  1:04:39
that makes sense to you at all. We'll work on that. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:45
Well, that'll give us a starting point

Unknown Speaker  1:04:50
to figure out where to go from there.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:56
We'll try to do that.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:01
It's still not completely clear how

Unknown Speaker  1:05:08
okay. So the bottom line is, we now have a mechanism for figuring out passes,

Unknown Speaker  1:05:17
and so

Unknown Speaker  1:05:19
some of them are just going to be

Unknown Speaker  1:05:24
priced at the same price as other sawing and some of them, like the three specialties, will be priced differently. So we'll take that pass out because we've got separate pricing, special pricing for it, right? Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:38
And anytime you do a diagonal angle cut or bubble cut,

Unknown Speaker  1:05:44
we would

Unknown Speaker  1:05:48
do we still need numbers of cuts for those. Are we still going to keep tracking that

Unknown Speaker  1:05:55
when it comes off the saw diagonal angle bevel? No, let's, let's just say that that entire piece of wood that go that that is affected by that cut is how many board feet got processed through that pass.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:15
Okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:06:21
so when George does clean up, he can ignore that until that goes away, we'll take it out. Do

Unknown Speaker  1:06:28
you understand? Okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:06:35
I want to bounce back a little bit.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:39
One thing we we skirted around a couple times when we take an item on a size or we cut it to length. If it's too short to run through the gang saw

Unknown Speaker  1:06:54
like, if we need 12 inches or anything less than 22

Unknown Speaker  1:06:59
we have to take it to one of the smaller saws to cut it to that shorter length.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:06
Yep, I don't

Unknown Speaker  1:07:12
Is that another pass? That's what? Yes, you think that's another pass.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:18
More so, more. So that's one pair right now we're taking the can tech right, and cutting the 18 inch right. That's a second pad. I would say it's two passes. So in the case it so, the easiest way that I would say to identify that would be based on, hey, it's shorter than 22

Unknown Speaker  1:07:43
automatic second pass,

Unknown Speaker  1:07:47
right.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:50
24 okay. 24 is a limit. Anything under 24 inches gets an automatic second pass charge. What

Unknown Speaker  1:08:01
would you call that second pass

Unknown Speaker  1:08:09
shortcut? Okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:08:13
I don't know. Maybe that's just a bad

Unknown Speaker  1:08:18
way. Ain't your I

Unknown Speaker  1:08:27
we're doing long length on the on the king or on the sizer. Now we're taking out there and cutting it to short, shorter stuff.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:39
What would we call that George

Unknown Speaker  1:08:44
second cut.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:48
It's a, I mean, it's a

Unknown Speaker  1:08:51
cut to length.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:57
Cut, the short length.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:12
What

Unknown Speaker  1:09:16
Second? Second guy?

Unknown Speaker  1:09:20
That

Unknown Speaker  1:09:29
second pass slash 40

Unknown Speaker  1:09:37
or second pass? Well, that's not coming. Matt, looking bad. Flash, we can, can we change the name later if you want to call it now? Yep.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:51
What are you thinking?

Unknown Speaker  1:09:53
Well, I don't care what you're thinking. It doesn't matter.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:57
I don't care either if i.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:00
That it makes, it makes sense to indicate either short or length or something like that, that but second cut, second pass, all, that's fine. It's, I'm I'm more concerned about what makes sense to you guys.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:14
Short length cut,

Unknown Speaker  1:10:18
okay. Short length cut,

Unknown Speaker  1:10:25
if any of you guys wake up at 3am in the morning with a better idea, we can always change it. I'll call

Unknown Speaker  1:10:33
you that.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:36
He might.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:39
I was doing my schedule at three o'clock this morning in my head.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:45
Hats off to you. I was, I was, I was sleeping at your three o'clock. I can tell you that. Yeah, where

Unknown Speaker  1:10:56
George? I didn't mean to bomb. Hey, sorry. One quick question, the 24 inches, if it's exactly 24 inches, is that still a short length cut, or is it 24 does it 24 go to the Yeah, 24 is one,

Unknown Speaker  1:11:11
one pass. Okay, one pass. So if it's less than, okay, less than 24 Yep.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:17
Perfect. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:23
Now let me bounce you with that one. If we cut it on the L and M as cants

Unknown Speaker  1:11:29
and then send it through

Unknown Speaker  1:11:32
the bandsaw, that would be two passes Correct.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:36
Well, we're always going to assume a sizing pass all right, on everything.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:46
So don't really matter. No, it don't really matter. All right.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:51
The 3d part is one pass like

Unknown Speaker  1:11:55
three dimensions, if it's too short for our big soul. Years ago, everything, every time you touched it, it was like, back then, it was three cents. So it got cut. It's three cents. We got one to Ray arm saw it's three cents. One, two, single hand notch, or another three cents. Yep. He just kept adding Yep, where your call can passes. Yeah. They were saying every time you touch it, yeah, like, if you touched it four times, it's your charge, yeah, that price? Yeah, that's what we're basically, what we're talking about, except the whole

Unknown Speaker  1:12:31
couple things there.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:35
Can I bounce something off of your mat? Yep, any items or any

Unknown Speaker  1:12:42
to timesheets for January, 23

Unknown Speaker  1:12:47
Yep. Steve Miller,

Unknown Speaker  1:12:56
yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:15
Know what's going on. You don't have new mock set. I

Unknown Speaker  1:13:35
you can see that. Yep, I can see it. What had happened? This gentleman started at 7am 745

Unknown Speaker  1:13:44
he had to go to production.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:47
And then you can see come back to the he came back to the salt shop at 915

Unknown Speaker  1:13:54
then he went back to production again at 1045

Unknown Speaker  1:13:57
that's not really on paid time off. But I didn't know what else to put there. So I don't know if I need another. I know have one paid time off and I have, I forget what the other

Unknown Speaker  1:14:10
what the other categories are.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:15
Yeah, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:18
I can give you assembly as an option if you want, yeah, forget what the I'm going to just edit. And, I mean, I can change, I can do. I just

Unknown Speaker  1:14:29
want to see what my categories are.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:35
And we have building grounds maintenance won't pay it off. And building grounds, I mean item prep,

Unknown Speaker  1:14:43
I'm thinking that was like, if we have to heat treat something, or

Unknown Speaker  1:14:48
strip or stamp or whatever that is, but I need something. You don't mean that's gonna

Unknown Speaker  1:14:55
if I, if I gotta pull one of my sewing guys off to production. I.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:00
Or say they're done for the day and they go do maybe run the hog or whatever. I just need

Unknown Speaker  1:15:08
a time frame there that I can put thank you

Unknown Speaker  1:15:13
that on there, right?

Unknown Speaker  1:15:16
I think it's, it's a

Unknown Speaker  1:15:19
bit of a question for Merv. I mean, adding, adding these, it's super simple. I think it's just a matter of, what categories do we want, and

Unknown Speaker  1:15:28
what it is. Friday, Steve Miller had to go over here and run the machine. So he left it, left the soil shop at 745 to 915 then came back out to the salt shop. Then he had to go back in to do something else at the production so I'm calling. I don't have a category for I got on paid time off maintenance and buildings, grounds and item prep. But I don't have anything if they come up from the salt shop,

Unknown Speaker  1:15:55
because once they go over here, then they're under, underneath T's production sheets. But I need something to show it's not really unpaid time off that we put that in the other week. That was if, say, John Ebers left at 12. Yeah, today, yeah, yeah, and he came back. At least they're going if they're going to assembly.

Unknown Speaker  1:16:15
Well, what do you if they're showing up in assembly? Matt the two. I mean, do these there's no connection between the two tracking systems. Is there? Not currently we could,

Unknown Speaker  1:16:32
in my mind,

Unknown Speaker  1:16:37
to me, what would make the most sense is, I

Unknown Speaker  1:16:43
because of its production, then you should be able to go into it. Should be showing T's, John T's production schedule. You Omen, hey, from seven to 915, he was production. And from 1045 to 1130 that's where his

Unknown Speaker  1:17:00
calculator comes in

Unknown Speaker  1:17:03
well, and I think

Unknown Speaker  1:17:06
part of the question is, do we want to I'm a little

Unknown Speaker  1:17:10
worried about having it be automatic. In some ways, seems better to me that each side, like you would put it in here as assembly, and he would put it in on their side, and we got some way to make sure that they, that they tie out, that he can't put

Unknown Speaker  1:17:31
it would show an issue if he puts somebody in while they're sawing. And it would show you if you put somebody in

Unknown Speaker  1:17:38
over assembly, right? I

Unknown Speaker  1:17:43
just want to have the right type in there so I don't, yeah, know what to put. So that's what I put on paid time off for now, until we until we figured it out. I don't care what it's called, if it's not confusing for you, Matt, I like if it's I mean, could you just put it in here as I don't know. How do you want to do that, George, because, like I was telling Matt, it's that's when John T's calculator kicks in. Yeah, if he's in production, right? I mean, it's almost going to have to match like Steve's time frame when he wrote on his time sheet, 745, 915, they wrote 1045, 1130, that's almost gotta match John T's production paper, cuz if I he has two different two different times, it's gonna throw it

Unknown Speaker  1:18:35
lackey. Well, yeah, but then, and I don't, you know, man, I just want to get to really take them? No, I understand.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:43
I don't care if you just call it assembly time on this paper. And it may not be a perfect match to assembly, because those guys aren't going 15 minute increments, like whatever Steve did here.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:58
I mean, they might be. They're writing to the minute they're supposed to be writing to the minute of when the job ends and the next job starts.

Unknown Speaker  1:19:09
So that may not be a perfect match for what guys are doing and sowing. So I personally don't care at this point if we call it assembly time, and don't try to mirror it off of assembly sheets.

Unknown Speaker  1:19:25
Now, how's that going to affect like, if you put assembly time in there, does that still or that's still, calculate your your time frame of what you were like there, total sewing time, 650,

Unknown Speaker  1:19:38
now, if you have them too as assembly. How does that? Hang on, sorry, what you said, if see right now, yeah, 650 it'll six hours and 50 minutes, right? It's only in time now,

Unknown Speaker  1:19:52
except for the old paid time off, right? So it's not going to, if you put assembly in there,

Unknown Speaker  1:19:59
it's not going to.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:00
Generate anything into the sawing so No, all right, but, but here's a question, unpaid time off.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:11
Unpaid time off, couldn't that just say non sawing time? Yes. Allen,

Unknown Speaker  1:20:19
Oh, okay. All right, up to, not sure what happened in there, I guess. And then I'll try to start it. Okay, okay. Thank you. Yep,

Unknown Speaker  1:20:30
perfect. Thank you, sir. Yes, sir, see it.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:37
I think that's a question. I mean, from my standpoint, I don't care what you call that. I think it's a question of, Do you want any kind of if you look at,

Unknown Speaker  1:20:48
let's say, you get to the end of the year and you're saying, Man, these guys worked this many hours, but we only had this much sawing time. And so here's your sawing time. There's 90% sawing time. But what's happening in this other 10%

Unknown Speaker  1:21:04
your categories here should be based on whatever questions you're going to ask. So to me, it's useful to say, well, they took off work.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:15
It's useful to say, you know, building and grounds, it was maintenance stuff. It's useful to say it was assembly. Sure,

Unknown Speaker  1:21:23
I don't know, but I'm good with that. It's a management question, really.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:30
I mean not, not non sawing. Time could be any

Unknown Speaker  1:21:35
of those things if we want to, if we want our guys to be specific, and they're bouncing back and forth, then they might as well be specific on both, I guess.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:50
Yeah, I mean,

Unknown Speaker  1:21:53
it's, it's, it's, it just don't

Unknown Speaker  1:21:57
unpaid time off does make sense, because it's not going to be included in payroll. So if you ever want to reconcile with pay, want to reconcile with payroll, that seems useful to have that broken out, yeah, I agree.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:09
Like, yep,

Unknown Speaker  1:22:12
literally don't care. I think that's the problem, and we're not finding a good reason to care one way or the other. Well, I care though. Let's make it the like you said for future reference, or,

Unknown Speaker  1:22:27
yeah, right, sure, yeah. Well, give me a target. So

Unknown Speaker  1:22:33
guys, you're using in production in the years, that's true. That's exactly right. It would be that would be nice to know. That's exactly right. Okay, so George, it's in your list now you're gonna, you're gonna,

Unknown Speaker  1:22:46
you're gonna write, you're gonna say that at the Christmas dinner.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:52
Oh, well,

Unknown Speaker  1:22:59
sorry, you might have to, you might have to reef or go to a different name and come, I guess, though, not

Unknown Speaker  1:23:06
sure why it's not there yet. It's because it's a new row. That's why,

Unknown Speaker  1:23:13
then come back to him. I

Unknown Speaker  1:23:30
um, assembly time, assembly time. So all I gotta do is go in. Do

Unknown Speaker  1:23:37
you want these on the printouts?

Unknown Speaker  1:23:42
What's assembly

Unknown Speaker  1:23:44
time. Do you want that as an option for them?

Unknown Speaker  1:23:49
Uh, yeah, please. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  1:23:52
I will need to. I need to adjust the printout a little bit tonight, because it's spilling over to two pages. We can do that.

Unknown Speaker  1:24:08
All right,

Unknown Speaker  1:24:11
that will help,

Unknown Speaker  1:24:14
okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:24:17
good,

Unknown Speaker  1:24:19
yeah. Other night, everything else is a

Unknown Speaker  1:24:23
little more cleanup, and

Unknown Speaker  1:24:26
you gotta get the Keystone pulled up.

Unknown Speaker  1:24:29
I'm right to par with Joel or on the brewer. I'm right to par with product or sawing up to par with time sheets. It's just I gotta catch up on

Unknown Speaker  1:24:40
the Keystones Cutlass.

Unknown Speaker  1:24:44
And that was my goal the last three days, but

Unknown Speaker  1:24:51
it'll come though.

Unknown Speaker  1:24:58
Yep, Matt, if George is a.

Unknown Speaker  1:25:00
Entering stuff in sewing now. Is it

Unknown Speaker  1:25:04
correctly tracking everything now or

Unknown Speaker  1:25:10
should be yes.

Unknown Speaker  1:25:15
I had a test on the

Unknown Speaker  1:25:20
when I made the fix,

Unknown Speaker  1:25:26
when you made the fixed, I guess, does that

Unknown Speaker  1:25:32
not identify what was wrong? No, I know what was wrong. It's just getting the information back. That's the problem. I

Unknown Speaker  1:25:43
then we don't have a specific date when it

Unknown Speaker  1:25:48
happened. It's any it's any yield,

Unknown Speaker  1:25:54
it's any second, third, fourth, etc. Day of yield got put on the wrong date, so there was never more than a second on any items that we know of

Unknown Speaker  1:26:06
like it might have, might have drove from, might have started cutting it one day and finish it the next day. But it would have never been three days

Unknown Speaker  1:26:15
unless it was attaching

Unknown Speaker  1:26:18
to the same item at it later. Yeah, you're right it, but I'm saying, is that what happened? Did it attach the same item to different dates? Sometimes?

Unknown Speaker  1:26:31
Sorry, I'm seeing one with three, so I'm not sure

Unknown Speaker  1:26:40
it's possible. But because, like, I was telling MERV, there might be, I can probably count on one hand with one of the gang saws that how many, like, for instance, this morning, yesterday, they finished a job,

Unknown Speaker  1:26:57
or they didn't finish a job, and then they don't mean they had to finish it the next day.

Unknown Speaker  1:27:02
I think it was yesterday. It might have been Friday, I'm talking out,

Unknown Speaker  1:27:07
but very minimal that they carry over the next day. Now the Keystone might have a little bit more with the 46 is when they're cutting 15 to 18,000 stringers in a day's time.

Unknown Speaker  1:27:21
Very minimal with what you call it, with carrying it over the next day. So with the Keystone and Brewer, I'm saying like four and four times and two times that that happened. But then we've got stuff, like

Unknown Speaker  1:27:37
we got plywood, the cantek. I um,

Unknown Speaker  1:27:45
those are kind of the big ones. Some with the pen do? There's some here and there other ones, but cantek and plywood are kind of the big,

Unknown Speaker  1:27:55
big ones.

Unknown Speaker  1:27:59
Now, there is a chance if on some of these,

Unknown Speaker  1:28:03
like, if you would go in,

Unknown Speaker  1:28:09
okay, some of these I wasn't sure about because I did some more digging last night, and

Unknown Speaker  1:28:17
some of these appear to be fairly obviously over produced,

Unknown Speaker  1:28:22
like we

Unknown Speaker  1:28:24
produced 144

Unknown Speaker  1:28:26
but we only needed 72 and we did 72 two days in a row. Which?

Unknown Speaker  1:28:31
Which? That's just by, you know, from the outside looking in, it's very interesting that we did exact double, same quantity, two days, exactly double. Yeah, that's

Unknown Speaker  1:28:45
and so some of that stuff, it could be if, if we walked through that, that we could fairly easily clean that stuff up. We're looking at, we're only looking at about 60 orders at this point.

Unknown Speaker  1:29:03
If you narrow it down to multi day, multiple days.

Unknown Speaker  1:29:11
So we started out, there was 1800 now there's only 60 with what you had

Unknown Speaker  1:29:17
cleaned up or whatever. Well, it's because I did more checking and best that I can tell the first day is always accurate, right?

Unknown Speaker  1:29:30
All right.

Unknown Speaker  1:29:33
But when you Okay, I'm sorry, man, I'm just I'm too hung up, maybe on

Unknown Speaker  1:29:42
the page that you showed us with all the entries, what I thought

Unknown Speaker  1:29:52
you said was all the entries that were recorded.

Unknown Speaker  1:29:59
But.

Unknown Speaker  1:30:00
If that was not a complete pay, if that was not complete with all recorded entries historically, then I'm I need to get off that kick.

Unknown Speaker  1:30:12
Well, because let's go. You want? Sorry, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:30:18
Let's go find out

Unknown Speaker  1:30:21
cheese. Let's do this.

Unknown Speaker  1:30:30
Because what I mean, what's your critical role right now? How much data, information do you need? Or can we launch it again? February 2, next week. We talked about that earlier. But what information you trying to grab a hold of? We're trying the

Unknown Speaker  1:30:49
Yes, but I understand you. I mean, that's a lot of data that we put in that yeah, is wasted. Yes,

Unknown Speaker  1:30:57
yeah, tell me to say, I mean, we're Yes. Sean, you too. We're sorry we're in the middle of this thing here. Have a good evening.

Unknown Speaker  1:31:12
Yes, George, like there's a yes. We can either use what we have, or we could just, I mean, let that be what it was, and move on. But if Matt saying it's working now i I'm saying, let's at least back and clean them 60. Oh, no, no. Oh well, if we can get them 60 clean, if it's only 60, yeah, we should be good to go, right.

Unknown Speaker  1:31:39
Can you send me there's 60 on an email or something, or on a, like, a page, Matt, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:31:47
and then I just send you the page, dig, I'll be right. I gotta plug in. Nobody plugged in. The food of that melt. Now, when I go in and try and repair that, what,

Unknown Speaker  1:31:58
like, what characteristics Am I looking for as far as repair?

Unknown Speaker  1:32:06
If you follow Well, I think,

Unknown Speaker  1:32:10
yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:32:12
I think what I would probably tell you in the one that I send you,

Unknown Speaker  1:32:18
I'll just let you edit the can't and the date, the can't quantity and the yield,

Unknown Speaker  1:32:25
and then you just

Unknown Speaker  1:32:28
either change the date

Unknown Speaker  1:32:30
or zero out the can't quantity and the yield if it's not, if it's not, if it, if it was an extra row.

Unknown Speaker  1:32:39
All right, so

Unknown Speaker  1:32:43
that. Yeah, that's fine, and

Unknown Speaker  1:32:49
I'm happy to again. I'm happy to help too, in whatever capacity I can. And

Unknown Speaker  1:32:55
now you're saying, Do you think like the date is given, the date that it's given? Is it like going to give me a close proximity to the page I'm looking for? Or do you think that dates like, yeah, out in the sky somewhere the

Unknown Speaker  1:33:12
the earliest date is going to be proximity. I'm pretty sure the earliest date is correct. So most likely it would be the next business day.

Unknown Speaker  1:33:23
That you're looking for, is what I'm looking for.

Unknown Speaker  1:33:28
Or next day. What did you say about the next day?

Unknown Speaker  1:33:32
Or the next and then the next business day? So, business day, I mean, so you you want to look at like, I mean, if they did it on the fifth and the fifths was on a Friday. Then look at the eighth start, looking at the eighth for the second half. All

Unknown Speaker  1:33:49
right.

Unknown Speaker  1:33:50
All right,

Unknown Speaker  1:33:52
yeah, if I run into a roadblock, I know where you're at, yep.

Unknown Speaker  1:33:58
But that's better than 1800

Unknown Speaker  1:34:01
it's a lot better than the 1800

Unknown Speaker  1:34:05
you know. It reminds me of a story my dad used to tell. He's like,

Unknown Speaker  1:34:10
This man came home from work one day and his wife's like, our son's got something to tell you. And his son like, swallows really hard, and he says, Dad, you know that really big pitch picture window that we've got? And his dad, like, yeah, he's like, Well, I broke the little tiny window right next to that one

Unknown Speaker  1:34:34
that sounds about right.

Unknown Speaker  1:34:38
I'm glad it's not as bad as I was nervous as I was afraid it was early. Yeah, I had my RAID can over there. I was going to bring it over, but I thought I better not. I don't want to, you want me to upset bad anymore than what what I think he feels like, right? But I was going to get my RAID can and say, Hey, if you find any more bugs, I'm I'm.

Unknown Speaker  1:35:00
Just

Unknown Speaker  1:35:01
That's hilarious. Man,

Unknown Speaker  1:35:04
Friday might not have been the perfect day to pull it out, but

Unknown Speaker  1:35:08
it's still funny. I'm not going to do that to the guy, so it's hilarious. I thought,

Unknown Speaker  1:35:15
I

Unknown Speaker  1:35:19
don't know where MERV went.

Unknown Speaker  1:35:21
Well, if he's, do you have anything right now? I mean, I'll just where I'm at right now. Okay, well, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, if you're good and he's out, I'm gonna grab a quick restroom break before he before he comes back. Alright, I just sent that over by email so you should have that now. Alright, sounds good. All right, awesome. Thanks for George. Do you need much else? Remember, you want to call it a wrap for today and hit

Unknown Speaker  1:35:53
you don't have much tomorrow?

Unknown Speaker  1:35:55
No, I'll, I'll go ahead. I'll, whenever you're done, if you need a break. I'll be here. Yeah, I'll be right back. Perfect. I need one

Unknown Speaker  1:36:09
too, actually,

Unknown Speaker  1:39:24
a

Unknown Speaker  1:39:28
four for Adam, three for

Unknown Speaker  1:39:32
me, Yeah, buddy, I'm whatever.

Unknown Speaker  1:39:36
All right, I'm good to go. Hey, so

Unknown Speaker  1:39:40
so we're not let me just always want to hop back to the page the email

Unknown Speaker  1:39:51
was that

Unknown Speaker  1:39:54
I don't know how to even note my emails proper anymore.

Unknown Speaker  1:40:00
It's, it's somewhere

Unknown Speaker  1:40:03
there, there we go. There we go.

Unknown Speaker  1:40:06
We we got through kind of, we have a whole raft of changes that we need for sawing, basically, do

Unknown Speaker  1:40:24
what we were, what step four,

Unknown Speaker  1:40:31
no, step Yeah, well, step four of No, step five here

Unknown Speaker  1:40:35
in step I mean, step five, six and seven in the sawing, step six, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:40:43
Step seven, blended rate labor and machine overhead. That's

Unknown Speaker  1:40:51
the next

Unknown Speaker  1:40:53
thing,

Unknown Speaker  1:40:57
right, yeah, the biggest thing is, I think

Unknown Speaker  1:41:01
the one question I did have was on

Unknown Speaker  1:41:06
boring angle bevel,

Unknown Speaker  1:41:12
so most passes would be priced the same for boring that Pass would be priced at a separate price point.

Unknown Speaker  1:41:24
Yes. Now that's just go ahead, sorry. Well, yes to your answer your question,

Unknown Speaker  1:41:32
we have now cast angle and bevel into the passes category,

Unknown Speaker  1:41:39
yep. No longer specialty cut holes. I am willing to throw holes or boring drilled

Unknown Speaker  1:41:52
into the passage category as well.

Unknown Speaker  1:41:57
Don't tell George if he's tallying number of holes we might need that in the future. That's good information. Very good information.

Unknown Speaker  1:42:11
Where's it gone? Michael said that always starts. We never had issues. Just leave it there.

Unknown Speaker  1:42:18
Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:42:20
I'll he'll figure it out in the morning. Yeah, thanks, man, I appreciate it. Sorry, Matt, yeah. Oh, good. So we could leave that in there, but, but, but not use it for pricing. Basically, the number of holes, yeah, the number of angle and bevel cuts, yeah, the angle and bevel cuts you didn't create, or did you do that too? Yeah, it's asking Him to fill it out,

Unknown Speaker  1:42:47
leave it. Let's leave it. Yes, but let's roll Yep. Let's do away with this. Let's call it a pat. What's that? Do you want it to show up on the cleanup for him to keep filling those out? Or do you just want to just keep what we Have, but don't tell them to clean up

Unknown Speaker  1:43:05
more things.

Unknown Speaker  1:43:40
Right? Okay, Matt, so, yeah, he so I can tell you,

Unknown Speaker  1:43:47
George is

Unknown Speaker  1:43:50
he has the gumption to go through all the prints again or items again, and add bevels, add angles, add holes, number of holes, number of levels, but

Unknown Speaker  1:44:05
he's relying he's going to use the prints as they're mirrored in the item data page, just like we he's going to rely on that to help speed up that process. The question, then, is

Unknown Speaker  1:44:20
prints with multiple pages, items with multiple pages of print.

Unknown Speaker  1:44:28
Did that? Do you have a is there a solution?

Unknown Speaker  1:44:34
By Yes, I'll have have it taken care of tonight, and

Unknown Speaker  1:44:42
I and been been available by probably Thursday. So unless you Yeah, yeah, you have the answer to that. Yep, he has the answer. It's going to be a day or so. Yeah, that's fine. Well, good.

Unknown Speaker  1:45:00
So I don't want to

Unknown Speaker  1:45:03
George is trying to leave.

Unknown Speaker  1:45:09
It's, it's, well, it's Matt, just for, for like,

Unknown Speaker  1:45:15
over overview, for us, the challenging, the more challenging stuff is is going back and redoing things. And I don't, I

Unknown Speaker  1:45:27
that's always anyway, if George is going to go through all the items again, I would.

Unknown Speaker  1:45:34
I don't want to burden you, George with going doing this again and again. So I just want to make sure we're not missing anything this, and I don't think we are, but

Unknown Speaker  1:45:48
I think we should hold off if I if George is, if we only want George to go through the items one time and clean everything up, I think we should hold off until we are have our 95 or 98% confident with our pricing model, and then make sure that we've got warnings for every piece of information that's missing in order to do accurate pricing, and then have him go through it. Because, I mean, we're finding we're going to just a simple thing of like drilling an assembly well. We didn't find that until the day, and if we, if he gets started too soon, he is going to have to do a second pass.

Unknown Speaker  1:46:28
Good with that, George, because I'm good with that. I'm perfect. I don't you were jumping right in, but I appreciate

Unknown Speaker  1:46:37
it. Yes, yes. And the ladies, the ladies are still not finished with all the prints either. So let's and I'm not trying to well, I'll put a little bit of pressure on today because they could. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:46:52
all right. Good. Thank you sir. See you.

Unknown Speaker  1:46:58
George said, Good night, whatever. Sleep, good buddy, don't set your alarm for three,

Unknown Speaker  1:47:07
four, something. 330, man, um.

Unknown Speaker  1:47:14
So Matt, yeah, the next thing,

Unknown Speaker  1:47:17
blended labor, machine overhead, I have the last four years of

Unknown Speaker  1:47:24
sewing labor.

Unknown Speaker  1:47:26
And

Unknown Speaker  1:47:29
hang on, what I have here,

Unknown Speaker  1:47:34
sewing labor and, oh, sorry, wages. I have sewing wages and assembly wages for the last four years based on Rick's data.

Unknown Speaker  1:47:47
Okay, so how do you want to input that? Do you just want to assemble a single we

Unknown Speaker  1:47:54
can do any number of ways. Doesn't matter to me.

Unknown Speaker  1:47:57
Put in the wage basis and the number of hours that that accounts for. And then we'll put in a separate here's how many board feet based on passes. And then come up with the number that way you're you lost. I'm going too fast again. Okay, okay, for me, too fast. Just for me, it's okay. I'm been spending too much time thinking about this

Unknown Speaker  1:48:23
as well. But the wage basis,

Unknown Speaker  1:48:27
do you want to calculate this in as a single number, like you crunch all that number, those numbers, or, I mean, it would make sense to me to put this in as three different numbers, both three for selling, three for assembly? Well, no, I'm not sure about assembly. I'll get to that

Unknown Speaker  1:48:47
on the sewing side, we need to know what is the

Unknown Speaker  1:48:53
what is the sewing labor,

Unknown Speaker  1:48:55
what is the sowing

Unknown Speaker  1:48:58
hours?

Unknown Speaker  1:49:02
Actually, it's more than that. Are we putting sawing overhead into this or

Unknown Speaker  1:49:12
not? No, we were going to just machine, do a lump sum, machine overhead, do

Unknown Speaker  1:49:23
I mean,

Unknown Speaker  1:49:25
because some stuff is just lumber, and we're not, I mean, okay, I guess we could, well, you could do it overhead, overhead based on the passes,

Unknown Speaker  1:49:35
yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:49:37
I mean, yeah, it would be machine overhead, which is so, I mean, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:49:41
So you would put in total labor

Unknown Speaker  1:49:44
sawing labor, sawing overhead on an annual basis. And then you would put in

Unknown Speaker  1:49:52
the number of passes, the board foot passes.

Unknown Speaker  1:49:58
And then let's.

Unknown Speaker  1:50:00
Silver loom. Calculate what that translates to for pricing so you can do it that way. Yeah, well, you're going to you would have to be accurate. You will have to look at historical in sage items, 2025,

Unknown Speaker  1:50:17
and how many board feet that calculates to with each item

Unknown Speaker  1:50:24
right, based on correct, based on the basis calculations correct is that,

Unknown Speaker  1:50:33
I'm sure that could be a lot of fun. Is that

Unknown Speaker  1:50:37
a lot of work too well

Unknown Speaker  1:50:41
we're going to be calculating passes anyway. We're going to need to be calculating it passes for,

Unknown Speaker  1:50:48
okay, items. So each item you're going to have, you're going to have the board feet, but then you're going to have the board feet processed based on passes correct. So here's event. It's an item. I Yeah, so an item ID? I see board feet, but I also see, yeah, I know what? Down in the bottom, you have three passes. So I could look at the I know it's 11.2 Armstrong Marietta times three. Now it's 20, 33.6, whatever,

Unknown Speaker  1:51:21
right? I mean, it's going to be and then, and then that, and then that,

Unknown Speaker  1:51:27
that number times all the Marietta we did last year. That's how many board feet we process for that item. And same thing with every item. Now we know how many board feet we actually passed through here last year, divided by the wages henceforth,

Unknown Speaker  1:51:48
labor for board foot,

Unknown Speaker  1:51:53
well, except, and it's going to have to be a, I don't

Unknown Speaker  1:51:57
know what level of precision we need on that, how many decimals, or if You want to do it by 1000 board feet, or how you want to, I

Unknown Speaker  1:52:05
don't know how that comes out. I understand. I don't. I'd rather have decimals than

Unknown Speaker  1:52:12
Sure. Then I don't know. I maybe I trying to think how that looked on that, on that, on that,

Unknown Speaker  1:52:22
oh, what's the window?

Unknown Speaker  1:52:29
What's that? Report, assembly analysis report with the fasteners. There's a couple categories there that confused me a little bit yet, which we just, we don't anyway, it doesn't matter, but it's ones where the numbers are

Unknown Speaker  1:52:46
based on,

Unknown Speaker  1:52:50
maybe it's just me, I get confused when it's based on 100 or based on 1000

Unknown Speaker  1:52:57
Does that make sense? Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:53:00
Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:53:04
It might be the faster count, or something

Unknown Speaker  1:53:08
quantity per hour, or something like that, yeah, yeah, but that's fine. I'm not concerned about that right now. I'm just so I don't know. So again, if,

Unknown Speaker  1:53:20
if the number would simply be dollars per board foot, and I'd rather see decimal point with four or five numbers than

Unknown Speaker  1:53:36
I don't know. Yep, yeah, it's just a preference. It doesn't there's no

Unknown Speaker  1:53:42
right or wrong, okay, yeah, I'm fine.

Unknown Speaker  1:53:47
So then we have the assembly. Wages,

Unknown Speaker  1:53:55
the assembly, okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:54:01
what do you want to call the machine cost? Are you calling it overhead? Are you calling it something else?

Unknown Speaker  1:54:09
I don't have great context right now. I

Unknown Speaker  1:54:14
I

Unknown Speaker  1:54:16
kind of want to have a conversation with my accountant around this.

Unknown Speaker  1:54:22
Um Sorry if I'm Bunny trailing here. But I last night, I was,

Unknown Speaker  1:54:29
I do some podcast anyway, one of Ramsey's. He was talking to talking to a lady about

Unknown Speaker  1:54:40
retained earnings that he was also talk they're talking about profit sharing. And he was talking about, what is your profit? And then he they, she they were talking about needing to purchase this machine, and he was saying, he said, you need to.

Unknown Speaker  1:55:00
To add that you need to, what

Unknown Speaker  1:55:05
did he say? You need to allot some of that profit over 10 years to pay off that machine, so now your profit is anyway. I forget what he called it, so I guess

Unknown Speaker  1:55:19
in that same sentence, I would love to know what's been our

Unknown Speaker  1:55:25
sawing machine costs for the last whatever, 20 years. And I can take an objective look at where we are and what I think our needs are, and just say, Okay, here's what we've spent historically. Here's what I'm anticipating now, gosh, there's inflation and everything else, and covid was a covid is a ridiculous we're struggling, man, we we're looking for a band. So all the things should have been under 50k in our minds, probably six years ago, five years ago, it probably would have been. And now the guy's saying 130 plus $1,000 for this thing. And it's like, wait, what you're

Unknown Speaker  1:56:09
these guys made bank a couple years and still went up and all that. And, yeah, it just, it just hyperinflation. I don't know whatever that is. But anyway, I don't know, Matt, it's a bony trail. Sorry if that's too much. So I mean, that's fine. That's that's fine. That's what we've done elsewhere, elsewhere in silver loom. We've, we've put in asset, put in assets, set useful life, set salvage value. That's basically it's worth. We bought it for this much. We're going to use it for 10 years. It's going to be worth this much in 10 years. 10 years, and then you just expense it out over that period. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:56:47
but you can have that conversation with should or could, could or should.

Unknown Speaker  1:56:53
Is there a and I don't know how much you've do, you think there's a scenario where we should actually call the sawing overhead. What we think our annual

Unknown Speaker  1:57:06
costs

Unknown Speaker  1:57:09
should be

Unknown Speaker  1:57:11
based on our needs and what we I don't know. Yeah. I mean, there should be a, it

Unknown Speaker  1:57:18
makes sense to be, well, the cost

Unknown Speaker  1:57:23
this is my opinion. I was informed by what I've seen and what we've done, but the cost should be what it actually okay, it's really useful, from a pricing and cost management standpoint, to say

Unknown Speaker  1:57:37
this. You know, sawing is these are the costs related to sawing. Okay, this is the raw material. Typically production would production, labor, overhead and Okay, typically, costs would be broken down into raw material, production, labor and production, overhead. With you. I think it actually makes more sense to get more granular and say there's raw material, they're sawing, there's, there's thawing, labor, sawing overhead, assembly, labor, assembly, overhead.

Unknown Speaker  1:58:08
And then your overhead would be your, your accounting for, you know, the equipment costs that you would depreciate out over, say, 10 years, or however long.

Unknown Speaker  1:58:19
And then, and then general overhead as well, yes, like a office, you know, Office admin type of overhead. And then you're, if you really want to do it right, then you need to start looking at, what is your, you know, what's your, what's your property and grounds maintenance, building grounds maintenance, and how, what percentage of it is used for,

Unknown Speaker  1:58:42
for which, which

Unknown Speaker  1:58:45
group. So, if, so, if, if, stalling uses a third of the building and, you know, etc, you it's back at the napkin. But you need to know

Unknown Speaker  1:58:57
it can be useful. Then the

Unknown Speaker  1:59:01
Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:59:06
or if building Yeah, I could buildings and grounds

Unknown Speaker  1:59:12
could be separated

Unknown Speaker  1:59:20
into these two

Unknown Speaker  1:59:25
but then, typically what we would see is, I can go

Unknown Speaker  1:59:30
into the details of how this gets set up, but basically

Unknown Speaker  1:59:35
the way,

Unknown Speaker  1:59:38
the way that My shed client has it set up is they'll actually,

Unknown Speaker  1:59:44
when they issue checks for maintenance, they'll actually, and even payroll, they'll post it to an asset account.

Unknown Speaker  1:59:54
And then, I mean, this is down the road from where we're at, but when the building gets sold.

Unknown Speaker  2:00:01
Old, I don't know. I'm getting deep in the weeds. It's going to take a minute to explain. But

Unknown Speaker  2:00:07
then at the end, end of the day.

Unknown Speaker  2:00:12
So when a bill, when, when your product gets sold, then you,

Unknown Speaker  2:00:22
then you move, move whatever your cost is, from that to a finished good. And when it gets delivered, you then sell it and expense it out. And then every month or every quarter you you shore up your

Unknown Speaker  2:00:39
those numbers and basically make sure that they things stay aligned and then balance.

Unknown Speaker  2:00:45
That's the

Unknown Speaker  2:00:47
poorly explained, trying to be short version, while still getting into the weeds a little bit.

Unknown Speaker  2:00:54
Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  2:00:58
Sure. So we still, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  2:01:01
brother, I wish I could, I wish, I wish I could stay on this

Unknown Speaker  2:01:08
and just do this until it's done.

Unknown Speaker  2:01:14
I am way too scattered. You're probably not as scattered as I am.

Unknown Speaker  2:01:21
Well, it's very helpful for me. Rather than try to keep all the big picture of what needs to be done

Unknown Speaker  2:01:29
to carve off little pieces, like, let's go,

Unknown Speaker  2:01:33
let's go get passes figured out, because we know we need that.

Unknown Speaker  2:01:37
And then, and then, let's update our pricing model to reflect that. And then let's keep going and let's refine it further. That's

Unknown Speaker  2:01:48
yep,

Unknown Speaker  2:01:49
yep. So the things, the pressures that I'm, that I've, that I'm feeling right now as it's as we've been doing. This is just when,

Unknown Speaker  2:02:06
and it's encouraging today. Did you and George go look at that?

Unknown Speaker  2:02:13
Sawing

Unknown Speaker  2:02:16
data that's that we have? Is it all there? Or, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  2:02:22
well, I don't know if it's all there.

Unknown Speaker  2:02:25
Is there a

Unknown Speaker  2:02:27
is there a Can I see it on here somehow?

Unknown Speaker  2:02:31
Yeah, you can

Unknown Speaker  2:02:33
silver loom. Or, do you want to share? Yeah, silver limb. Oh.

Unknown Speaker  2:02:43
Okay, so go down to the folders, and it's in

Unknown Speaker  2:02:47
2026 123, cleanup that one.

Unknown Speaker  2:02:52
Yeah, not, not that one, the one right below it.

Unknown Speaker  2:02:56
Oh, back.

Unknown Speaker  2:02:58
Yeah, yeah, hit the folder

Unknown Speaker  2:03:02
and it's 123 clean up that one, yep,

Unknown Speaker  2:03:07
and then Yep, that, that'll show you everything that we

Unknown Speaker  2:03:12
it's like 1800 Yeah, that's Wait 1000. Oh, it's 1800

Unknown Speaker  2:03:21
I mean, that seems like a lot, 1219, splitter

Unknown Speaker  2:03:29
contact

Unknown Speaker  2:03:34
was

Unknown Speaker  2:03:37
once.

Unknown Speaker  2:03:42
Oh, there's the yield.

Unknown Speaker  2:03:51
Doesn't seem like a lot, but

Unknown Speaker  2:03:54
I can't without the quantities.

Unknown Speaker  2:03:59
It's not a lot of yield.

Unknown Speaker  2:04:02
That seems it doesn't seem like a lot of yield on the brewer there on 1220

Unknown Speaker  2:04:09
that's where I've been get that's where I was getting hung up earlier.

Unknown Speaker  2:04:15
It's 1221 in here. Or does it Wait? Does add it to the schedule? Does that mean that's the date it was added to schedule? Is that the date it was actually that's the date it was? Yeah, it was added to the cut list on that date. But if you go into the here's the other thing that we should take a look at, because I'm not sure why these numbers aren't adding up. If you go to on the menu, if you go to sawing analysis, on folders, on the menu itself, the main menu,

Unknown Speaker  2:04:43
the home the home screen, yep, and you could go into sawing analysis.

Unknown Speaker  2:04:50
Just hit Continue. There you go.

Unknown Speaker  2:04:54
There's still a bunch of stuff that's not lining up properly, like

Unknown Speaker  2:04:59
on this.

Unknown Speaker  2:05:00
Remember

Unknown Speaker  2:05:01
the let's see, let's go back.

Unknown Speaker  2:05:05
Okay, like, let's go back to the 23rd the third one down. Oh, stay on there. Stay on there. Yep, yep.

Unknown Speaker  2:05:16
Third one down. What do you mean by third one here? The keys here. Sorry, it's not that one, that one. So the 23rd Keystone is blacked out. We have sawing time on the Keystone, but we don't have any yield on the Keystone,

Unknown Speaker  2:05:35
right?

Unknown Speaker  2:05:37
So why is that?

Unknown Speaker  2:05:41
Well, this linear feet per

Unknown Speaker  2:05:46
hour, hang on, this linear feet per hour is way too low. Matt, it's pulling off of the Wait a

Unknown Speaker  2:05:57
minute.

Unknown Speaker  2:05:59
These numbers way too low,

Unknown Speaker  2:06:03
but he didn't put in any yield on

Unknown Speaker  2:06:07
this is the 23rd

Unknown Speaker  2:06:16
What am I missing?

Unknown Speaker  2:06:21
These aren't marked complete. They're still in the schedule.

Unknown Speaker  2:06:30
Okay?

Unknown Speaker  2:06:34
I mean, did he just not

Unknown Speaker  2:06:55
Yeah, you need a ticket.

Unknown Speaker  2:07:00
Sorry, I'm on a zoom call here.

Unknown Speaker  2:07:03
You got a key? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  2:07:09
you

Unknown Speaker  2:07:10
know where to go. They've been doing this for 30 years.

Unknown Speaker  2:07:22
I

Unknown Speaker  2:07:27
I mean, but I'm not seeing like, I mean this as an example. I'm not seeing Keystone yield being entered

Unknown Speaker  2:07:38
on the brewer. Let's go take a look. Oh, I know. Okay, Matt, Matt, he's behind on that. I do know that. Okay, all right,

Unknown Speaker  2:07:46
but these numbers do not like, here's 124, 49

Unknown Speaker  2:07:51
that's way off. And then these other numbers are just way too low.

Unknown Speaker  2:07:57
Like, if you look at the brewer on the 23rd we've got

Unknown Speaker  2:08:02
trying to see where

Unknown Speaker  2:08:06
these numbers are, what these numbers are like. There's no way.

Unknown Speaker  2:08:12
God, what's your name? Man, yield, 6182

Unknown Speaker  2:08:18
well,

Unknown Speaker  2:08:20
just see it,

Unknown Speaker  2:08:23
something's wrong with the report. It's because he's got, like,

Unknown Speaker  2:08:30
no, that's linear, feet per hour,

Unknown Speaker  2:08:33
six.

Unknown Speaker  2:08:46
So we had 17 hours of selling time with the brewer, two guy a little over two guys,

Unknown Speaker  2:09:00
largest order, or the largest batch, was 6100 times

Unknown Speaker  2:09:10
we it should be.

Unknown Speaker  2:09:15
Yeah, that is wildly off.

Unknown Speaker  2:09:21
Man, I hate to cut out. I have to go

Unknown Speaker  2:09:25
home.

Unknown Speaker  2:09:30
Yep, Matt, you have

Unknown Speaker  2:09:35
this is way back. Sage, access,

Unknown Speaker  2:09:39
all of that stuff.

Unknown Speaker  2:09:46
You have all that, right? I mean, we talked about all the different sea ports and, okay, good deal. I'm gonna, I'm gonna leave that LA um.

Unknown Speaker  2:09:58
The other one was.

Unknown Speaker  2:10:02
Of, oh, it can always, I'm overwhelmed with stuff my word.

Unknown Speaker  2:10:11
I'm trying not to take it out on my team, um,

Unknown Speaker  2:10:16
in any way, you know. Um, yep.

Unknown Speaker  2:10:21
And I got, I got John T he's, he's struggling. He's just, and his identities work, and he's like, he's just, he's not a good spot. And I had a good talk with him today. But he's, I mean, he needs to know that

Unknown Speaker  2:10:38
his success isn't about

Unknown Speaker  2:10:42
his performance or doing what he's always done or whatever he's he just he's so, he's so he's so feels like he has to do what he's always done and get done what he's always done. And I'm asking for different

Unknown Speaker  2:10:59
anyway.

Unknown Speaker  2:11:01
I'm trying to walk with Him and these other guys, and

Unknown Speaker  2:11:06
Rick's,

Unknown Speaker  2:11:09
no, I don't know. Rick's just got there's,

Unknown Speaker  2:11:12
yeah, that hasn't changed.

Unknown Speaker  2:11:18
Anyway, he's, he's,

Unknown Speaker  2:11:22
he plays nice. Every once in a while, the ugly, the little ugly thing, shows up, pops up, and then it goes away again. It just, you know, he lets it out, and then he tucks it away nicely.

Unknown Speaker  2:11:39
Anyway, it's like,

Unknown Speaker  2:11:41
so I'm trying to do that and um

Unknown Speaker  2:11:45
on this stuff here. I mean, George is a big boy. He can handle a lot.

Unknown Speaker  2:11:52
Um,

Unknown Speaker  2:12:04
I think when we if we do the the

Unknown Speaker  2:12:09
last time we did this update, they were saying there was prints. I don't know what's right or not. I don't have time to check it all out, prints that showed up that weren't there before. Maybe

Unknown Speaker  2:12:23
I'm wondering if some some of the Excel stuff that we did prior to 24

Unknown Speaker  2:12:30
got pulled across somehow. Is that possible? Just recently? Oh, just recently? Yeah, like recent updates. Is there any chance there was any Excel data that came across

Unknown Speaker  2:12:49
from prior to 24

Unknown Speaker  2:12:53
let's go take a look.

Unknown Speaker  2:12:57
So if we look at

Unknown Speaker  2:13:01
like how, like, in the last how many months? Month, three weeks. Last month, three weeks.

Unknown Speaker  2:13:10
So let's look at all items that we got created in the last

Unknown Speaker  2:13:15
I mean,

Unknown Speaker  2:13:18
the only new items that were added. George added a bunch of wave. He added a temp co

Unknown Speaker  2:13:27
topan,

Unknown Speaker  2:13:30
some VR ones, another, Remy, sturdy. HT,

Unknown Speaker  2:13:36
Bs, one. There's no prints that showed up. Since I didn't do anything.

Unknown Speaker  2:13:43
There's no item data that I know of that would have shown up now, not unless they meant like a, did they mean like a?

Unknown Speaker  2:13:54
Like there's a print in silver limb

Unknown Speaker  2:13:59
that wasn't there before.

Unknown Speaker  2:14:04
I think I don't if nothing came across

Unknown Speaker  2:14:09
then.

Unknown Speaker  2:14:12
I mean, is that item data or the actual PDF for the print

Unknown Speaker  2:14:16
item data,

Unknown Speaker  2:14:19
or there's no new item codes. Yeah, it's probably not then. So again,

Unknown Speaker  2:14:32
if I could just do this and focus on all this stuff,

Unknown Speaker  2:14:39
that'd be good. But

Unknown Speaker  2:14:47
I can't,

Unknown Speaker  2:14:53
I don't know. I'm not sure

Unknown Speaker  2:14:57
this also for me as a leader. If.

Unknown Speaker  2:15:00
I if I could step back from

Unknown Speaker  2:15:04
but I can't. I don't want to either from this.

Unknown Speaker  2:15:09
I just have to create margin somewhere, somehow,

Unknown Speaker  2:15:20
I the the little bit at a time is I think that's okay, but I don't know if it's okay for me and the team here so much.

Unknown Speaker  2:15:32
I don't know, Matt, I'm, I'm not trying to. I'm arguing it. I'm not trying. I'm not arguing. I'm, I'm just trying to. What

Unknown Speaker  2:15:40
would you idealize?

Unknown Speaker  2:15:52
I don't I don't know.

Unknown Speaker  2:15:59
Like, this is my observation.

Unknown Speaker  2:16:03
Is that

Unknown Speaker  2:16:06
okay, you say something like, let's figure out pricing. Ah, that'll be easy. That's simple.

Unknown Speaker  2:16:13
But then layer upon layer upon layer, as you dig into it, it's like, yeah, yeah, but it's not actually, and my concern with and which is a little bit of what we ran into last time you were out, I don't mind, like, if we're just,

Unknown Speaker  2:16:29
if we can get enough, okay, the time where I just had somebody come out last week and spend a couple days together, which is one of the, one of the reasons why I was less available last week, but we had 24 discrete chunks of stuff that we wanted to work through. We knew what the block was we and then we picked out the biggest priority ones, and we did them. This here has

Unknown Speaker  2:16:58
and there's everything is so interconnected. When it comes to pricing,

Unknown Speaker  2:17:05
it's very hard to tease out one specific piece and

Unknown Speaker  2:17:10
or it's felt like to me, one specific piece and get it 110%

Unknown Speaker  2:17:16
correct, or get it, get it nailed down.

Unknown Speaker  2:17:20
It felt to me like when you were out here, that

Unknown Speaker  2:17:25
really the ideal ratio is

Unknown Speaker  2:17:27
we spend a fourth of our time, or

Unknown Speaker  2:17:34
a third of our time talking things through, and then really for me to wrap my head fully around it, to know the implications for the next step, you almost have to, yeah, well, the ideal is, is, no, I'm sorry, I'm not trying to cut you off. Oh, go ahead. You go. Ideal is, you know, it's,

Unknown Speaker  2:17:53
I mean, obviously, if you'd be here on site, I mean, that would be,

Unknown Speaker  2:18:00
that would be, ah, it was. It just seems like it would so much easier. You'd be here, on the job, on, I mean, like basically, on the project, and

Unknown Speaker  2:18:13
day in, day out,

Unknown Speaker  2:18:17
see it through.

Unknown Speaker  2:18:19
It would seemingly go away faster, and

Unknown Speaker  2:18:24
it would it, it's become, it's sort of kind of a fragmented for us in our in our day here it's, it's a bit of a

Unknown Speaker  2:18:35
it's a bit fragmented with

Unknown Speaker  2:18:39
this, with normal, and then the and so it's,

Unknown Speaker  2:18:44
I don't know. I'm not complaining. I'm I'm just, I just want to be,

Unknown Speaker  2:18:50
oh, I don't know.

Unknown Speaker  2:19:02
I don't know we're close. I mean, I know we're getting closer. I'm not, you know, I know we're getting closer.

Unknown Speaker  2:19:11
I'm very open to

Unknown Speaker  2:19:15
I'm very open to restructuring as we need to. I Ooh,

Unknown Speaker  2:19:23
do you feel like,

Unknown Speaker  2:19:28
are you feeling more the fragmentation? Is the team feeling more of the fragmentation? Is it both? Yeah, I don't know. It's,

Unknown Speaker  2:19:42
it's it's just another, it's another thing on top of and it's, and it's not the it's not the normal. It's not, really not the usual. So it, it has this. It feels it.

Unknown Speaker  2:20:00
Feels like

Unknown Speaker  2:20:03
a little on this it feels little. It feels like extra and and when it's

Unknown Speaker  2:20:12
it's just additional work. And it's not like, you know, making anybody feel better at this time and walking home with a extra money at this time or anything like it, that's, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  2:20:30
I believe in it because of the what I believe in the in end goal, right?

Unknown Speaker  2:20:36
I believe in it. But for these guys, I don't, how do you? How do Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  2:20:42
what's Alan's role right now?

Unknown Speaker  2:20:45
He's his role is to

Unknown Speaker  2:20:49
do

Unknown Speaker  2:20:51
small projects, basically, and help where needed, which is, could be snow removal running the hog. He's gonna start where we're seeing our recycling area, which is I want to develop, and so it's a good way for him to come in. I'm taking anyway. I'm taking some of that. I'm going to I'm working on transitioning a few things off of John's plate, which I think he's accepting, at least in his heart, I think he's open to that now and then, to George with Alan as having a piece of that. And I want, anyway, just trying to raise up

Unknown Speaker  2:21:31
more people that. And with Alan, I want him to learn silver loom and our products and our items, and so getting him involved with the

Unknown Speaker  2:21:42
height dimensions give him and gave him a nice window to items.

Unknown Speaker  2:21:50
So I don't know what, and I may, I may ask him to do data entry yet, I It's gonna take a little time. At this point, he seems like he has the capacity to sit at a desk, do good numbers, I'm not seeing like

Unknown Speaker  2:22:08
a lot of mistakes. So he's, he's, he's a, he's a, he's an asset, that

Unknown Speaker  2:22:16
he's an asset. I can, you know, I can throw some things at it.

Unknown Speaker  2:22:21
So is there a world so

Unknown Speaker  2:22:25
most of our projects of this scale? Well, most,

Unknown Speaker  2:22:29
most companies at your size, don't have the owner as the primary stakeholder in a project. Typically, yeah, typically, it's either it plus respective departments,

Unknown Speaker  2:22:46
or it's a CFO, or it's something like that. I am it, and I am CF CEO, and I am General Manager and I'm owner. So yeah, that's the problem. Is there a world in which it would make sense to for? Well, I guess two of the questions is, do you want to, do you want to hire or cultivate some of those hats at the hand off? Yeah. And is there, is there a world in which it makes sense for Alan to start sitting in on these meetings? And could he, if he's sharp with this stuff, and I don't know if he is, but if he's sharp with this stuff, could he start being the go to guy for all these questions, and he relays. And project management helps. Project helps, kind of liaison, liaison between the

Unknown Speaker  2:23:29
everything, yeah, I Yeah, it's, it's, that is a possibility, and I can let me think on that and farther and

Unknown Speaker  2:23:41
sort of yeah, let me, let me, let me throw some feelers out and try a few things, few more things with that. And, yeah, okay, yep, yep.

Unknown Speaker  2:23:56
I almost pulled him in the meeting the other day just for his and but I didn't have time to think through it far enough. Sure makes sense.

Unknown Speaker  2:24:07
It's ridiculous. Being at a place where you're

Unknown Speaker  2:24:11
you're so out of margin that you can't even,

Unknown Speaker  2:24:16
you know, like, I have a meeting tomorrow on State College. I'm supposed to go to a board meeting. And I was like, I need to cancel out of it today. And I didn't even have time to call the person to cancel myself out. It's just that's just stupid in my life waiting for me now and

Unknown Speaker  2:24:35
Alright,

Unknown Speaker  2:24:38
so one, one last thing, one, one last thing to throw out there. A while back, I put together a process to go through workload responsibilities takes about hour, hour and a half categorized to figure out what's easiest to hand off, what's lowest value, what's low hanging fruit to delegate. So if that's a process that's useful in this whole.

Unknown Speaker  2:25:00
A

Unknown Speaker  2:25:01
conversation. We can chat. You need to go, go to your family. Yeah, is that like a spreadsheet or what is? What is that the way we've typically it's it? Well, it's an

Unknown Speaker  2:25:11
it's a little app that you log into. Oh, yeah, you could, I could, I could. I think I can. I need to make sure it's all up and running the way it should. But I could probably get you an account get you to log in, and you can do it yourself. Definitely interested. I did a thing earlier at our peer group was about

Unknown Speaker  2:25:30
80 80% something like that of what we do

Unknown Speaker  2:25:36
was, was estimated can be done by high school graduate. 95% could be done by a college graduate. What's the 5% that only you can do? And that is cool. I have.

Unknown Speaker  2:25:50
Part of my problem is the things I'm running into, like the storm prep last week. You know, I jump into jockey truck Saturday. Well, I committed to get some lumber. Went to use straight truck. Well, they didn't get the one load delivered a new haul until 410 well, it should have been, should have called ahead, but nope, it didn't call ahead. But yeah, we should have, but we didn't. We showed up at 410 on a Friday, and they couldn't unload a guy, so he comes back straight trucks, full, loaded. I need it Saturday morning to quick. Make a run down the hill to get this lumber. Okay, now I can't do that. So now I gotta adjust. Then I come down. I go to move a trailers. I pull the jockey truck out of the out of truck yard, 300 feet out later, just off the edge of the road, thing shuts off. We'll find out it's out of fuel. Then it took us till Saturday night, nine o'clock, till we finally got that thing going. And then my young maintenance guy, Michael, smart kid, but he thinks he has all the answers. I'm like, Michael, I know you're super confident. This is a long story short. Finally, on that, Michael, I know you're pretty confident that you're right, but I think heating this piece would probably help in this situation. We pump the fuel through the diesel, got the air out the fired a little bit anyway. Finally, he's like, he looks at me funny, and went throughout a conversation. Finally, I'm like, Michael, I'm gonna get the heater and I gotta hear we put her on there. Hour later, things running fine. And he's like, Oh, you're right. I'm wrong. Give me a hug. You know, Mike, this ain't about you being wrong. This is about anyway. Like, Lord, was that worth necessary for him to absorb that? Like, and, you know, he leaves. He wants to leave early on Tuesdays and Thursdays to go work in his little garage. But then I don't my other the other best maintenance man is in jail right now, and I'm like, I just need to be like, Michael, you gotta be here. He's, oh, no, John. Uncle John. He can handle it, but no. Uncle John didn't handle it today. Today again, Matt. He didn't handle there's things guys were coming in here when we're talking to you stuff like that, I just am not either.

Unknown Speaker  2:27:50
Yeah, I don't have anybody here on my side that's like,

Unknown Speaker  2:27:56
it's, it's just stupid. It's a stupid thing. Like, I challenge people. I challenge Rick last week on a pricing thing, and he threw a fit about it. I went home Thursday. I had my daughter, Maurice, away. I don't know I came back because nobody was taking care of Alan. He's out picking up a thing for the maintenance guys. I come back in here. Alan called me three times. He called Ricky, called Tina. They both put him on hold. He's trying to get through to Michael. Finally, I have my finally, I have my daughter in the back car, came down, got my radio, walked in office. There's Rick. He had George and John in his office talking about me, you know, like just pitching to them, because I challenged him on a pricing thing again. Well, it seems like I'm always waiting for the other shoe to fall blah, blah, blah,

Unknown Speaker  2:28:41
you know, just do I think he's the cancer in the whole thing. I really do. He took something else and twisted it came to me something about George just yesterday, and I'm, I don't why I'm still putting up with it stupid. Well, because it looks easier to tolerate it than it does to bear the pain of

Unknown Speaker  2:29:05
the alternative. I guess I'm waiting for the perfect world where I have the margin to deal with it properly. Because, you know, my and then my advisor, he's like, Oh, you gotta document everything. Well, I don't hardly have time to document stuff fast enough. I was at home Sunday documenting from last week some stuff. It's just ridiculous, like I'm, you know what? I mean, it's like I'm a place where I can't catch my tail.

Unknown Speaker  2:29:29
I'll get there. Hey, I'll get there, Matt. I just Yep. You hear where I'm at with this and that. But Alan is a, definitely an asset to this conversation, and

Unknown Speaker  2:29:46
we're going to make through this, I think you're going to find somewhere Matt, every time I look at these pages in sewing, there's definitely a bunch of missing data that I'm sure George entered on.

Unknown Speaker  2:30:00
Ready 99% sure. I'm sure we cut way more than all these numbers that we're looking at right here, right I don't know if that helps it or not. I hope, Lord, help us to get through this and find this and

Unknown Speaker  2:30:16
you know, whatever, we'll, we'll, we'll move on. I'm not we don't want to go back and

Unknown Speaker  2:30:23
sort through either.

Unknown Speaker  2:30:28
We take what we have, use it the best we can, and start with the fresh stuff. Wherever that is,

Unknown Speaker  2:30:37
we'll get we'll get it. We'll get it. Thank you, sir. Yep, thanks for everything else.

Unknown Speaker  2:30:44
No, I don't think so. I had a chat with Ellis. I might restructure the software side of this thing a little

Unknown Speaker  2:30:52
bit still open to your I don't know what this needs to look like,

Unknown Speaker  2:30:58
but, yeah, I don't know. I get multiple maybe, maybe when they're when you do an update, maybe we should do it, I don't know, during the day, and then, like,

Unknown Speaker  2:31:14
try stuff right away, maybe, or something I don't want, is that? Would, that can?

Unknown Speaker  2:31:22
It's there.

Unknown Speaker  2:31:24
But see, I'm not sure at this point where stuff is. I mean,

Unknown Speaker  2:31:28
I know it's

Unknown Speaker  2:31:31
part of it is

Unknown Speaker  2:31:33
I've not been putting in the extra work to communicate with everybody. Of this is, these are the changes that are coming.

Unknown Speaker  2:31:45
Yeah, maybe, if that's if you can't, that's probably worth it, right? I'm sure so then and then we

Unknown Speaker  2:31:54
for these guys to come in in the morning when they're trying to make their schedules. That's been a frustration for George a couple times, you know, something, all of a sudden, something's not working right, and it's just him. He's he's the first one in and I know that that feels unsettling. But if we do, like,

Unknown Speaker  2:32:14
you know, one o'clock in the afternoon, or, I don't know, 12 O'Clock lunch time, and then I don't know, just

Unknown Speaker  2:32:24
Yep, sure. Okay. Anyways,

Unknown Speaker  2:32:28
good, good man. I appreciate you. Awesome. Likewise. Thank you.

Unknown Speaker  2:32:33
Thanks, man, see ya. Yep, yep.
