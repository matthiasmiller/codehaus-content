Speaker 1  00:14
At here, I don't know. Let me figure that. I'll get back to you. Yeah, just something to think about. Alright, but I better see okay. Alright, thanks, thank you.

Unknown Speaker  00:24
Hey, Matt. Hey, yes, sir, Alright, hey, yeah, what's what's sorry

Speaker 1  00:37
with I'm here. I said Amanda was in here for a little bit, but um, where do you want to

Matthias Miller  00:51
go? Well, touching on the sewing thing is that, what's the best way to what's the best way to handle

Unknown Speaker  01:09
that? Can you be more specific

Matthias Miller  01:11
of like cleaning up the sawing data entries, the entries, the entries. Does that mean? I mean, it's good. What's that? Does it mean literally clearing out the old data and starting over? Does it just mean going back through and George cleaning it up? Or what's, what are the implications of that?

Speaker 1  01:36
I mean, for Yeah, in house, it, George entered everything. He had a sort of a system, and he would have to go back through and redo it for somebody else to do. It probably take way, I don't know how much longer. A lot longer. Yeah, I would have to ask him to take time. And, I mean, he has a stack of papers that's all right, right, 10 inches or so, maybe a maybe more 12 inches high on his on his desk. There clip, clips and stuff in it. Um, yeah,

Speaker 2  02:24
because, because,

Speaker 1  02:27
yeah, see, like the song, schedule is pages, and each guy, each each saw, has the pages. He puts the pages at each saw in the morning. And then when they do work on that saw the pages, I guess there's multiple packets that come back to him every day. Everything's not going recorded on one packet. So he has all these packets that he's getting back, and then he goes back. And I wasn't with him when he did any of the entries so, but I know that's a nutshell of what he's been doing.

Matthias Miller  03:15
Is there a reason why we don't just print out saws on different pages? I

Speaker 1  03:23
You're saying different saws on different pages

Matthias Miller  03:26
instead of printing out the packet multiple

Unknown Speaker  03:39
times me, I could spit out an answer.

Unknown Speaker  03:44
The reason is

Speaker 1  03:47
probably its way. He's always done it. But it also works for the forklift drivers, because they get the whole pack. And we've never tracked before, so we've never used the schedule for tracking before.

Speaker 1  04:12
Yeah, it's, it's, it's, it's worth looking in. It's worth considering. Would be some more discussion about things for sure. He hasn't. He didn't complain about any of that as far as the packets. But I'm not What were you gonna say?

Matthias Miller  04:37
I was just gonna ask from your from your perspective, I can see if I can pull more data out for basically, not the dates, but potentially, potentially. The, you know, additional amounts that were used and but I'm going to guess George is still going to ideally cross reference it with,

Matthias Miller  05:20
and I don't know,

Matthias Miller  05:26
clean up without full reentry,

Speaker 1  05:29
yeah, I looks messy. There it looks it looks met. It looks harder. It looks harder, right? It looks harder that way.

Matthias Miller  05:43
What would happen if

Matthias Miller  05:54
it stinks to have the lost data? But what would happen if we would say, I

Matthias Miller  06:03
we only really would that if we would ignore if we if we would, how important is, is that two months worth of data in pricing and other things that we're trying to do. I

Unknown Speaker  06:25
um,

Unknown Speaker  06:40
so that there's let me think a little more.

Unknown Speaker  06:50
Have to think farther through the pricing um,

Unknown Speaker  06:57
we're tracking every saw. I um,

Unknown Speaker  07:05
it's giving us specific

Unknown Speaker  07:13
data for each soul.

Unknown Speaker  07:18
Um, but

Speaker 1  07:24
is on pricing. We're let's talk about that for second. We're using as it, as it pertains to the cost of sawing,

Unknown Speaker  07:36
we attach price per board foot

Unknown Speaker  07:48
for Most of the saws

Speaker 1  07:59
on that and the and if we're going by price per board foot, aren't We?

Unknown Speaker  08:18
Are we taking data from all of those saws, then

Speaker 1  08:26
we had three exceptions. It was the chop saw, the state pointer and diagonal cuts

Unknown Speaker  08:40
that were

Speaker 1  08:43
specific price which we want to decide if that should be a price per whole, price per cut, or because we want to, I want to get some data on those three, those three processes, everything else we're tracking, board feet and hours.

Matthias Miller  09:15
Would it? Would it be helpful to go through my pricing document that I sent over, maybe, and see if that's that might be a good place to start, and see if that's where we're still At.

Unknown Speaker  09:27
Okay, yep,

Matthias Miller  09:36
it's in your email from last night.

Speaker 1  09:55
The last one, yep, that was yesterday, at 330 Know I'm Yep,

Unknown Speaker  10:13
hey,

Unknown Speaker  10:31
lumber size record. Let me calculate number size Record,

Unknown Speaker  10:54
like, roughly for pricing, this

Matthias Miller  11:08
is something I wanted To ask the 65 cents in the here. What's up? Is the 68 and a half cents for the two by four. Is that price per linear foot or price per nominal board foot?

Unknown Speaker  11:39
That's a a

Speaker 1  11:45
that's a board foot, nominal Board Flip price, okay? That answer,

Unknown Speaker  11:54
yep, okay.

Speaker 1  11:59
Unit of measurement apply nerve calculator for pricing. Start with round dimensions from step one, standard raw material is dimensional lumber, just to order footage based on anomalous actual lie the curve. There's what is only calculated is that the

Matthias Miller  12:27
board we don't need. The only reason we need board footage for pricing is if the unit of if we're if the item is priced, if the unit of measure is based on board feet. But for something like plywood, it's priced on a per each heat shooting is based on outside dimensions, which, obviously that's not relevant for raw material, but yeah,

Speaker 1  12:47
and in, sorry, what is the scenario when there's board feet without curve random? Okay, because you have debate, you have a curve calculation

Unknown Speaker  13:05
that's applied otherwise

Matthias Miller  13:09
for random we round it up, just rank, round up the dimensions, yes, to half inch or inch, and that's okay.

Speaker 1  13:20
So you're saying, You're you're using, okay, it's just a different so in the random scenario, if it's random, and we're calling it 7/16 random, you're going to call it you're going to round it up to half inch.

Matthias Miller  13:43
Would you rather assign the curve percentage based on half inch increments, on random? Sure we could do that as well. If that makes more sense,

Speaker 1  13:56
if that's a more broad take, and if that helps simplify it at all otherwise. So then when you say about applying curve,

Unknown Speaker  14:18
applying curve

Speaker 1  14:20
is taking the size that we're cutting it to be and calling it the size that is actually being cut with the curve correct.

Matthias Miller  14:37
So the math is, take the in the the actual yield size divided by 100% minus curve percentage.

Unknown Speaker  14:53
And and

Speaker 1  14:54
are you? Are you using curve percentage, or are you calling it? Well, I guess you're using. That curve percentage.

Matthias Miller  15:01
That's what, that's what we're calling it right now. Yeah,

Speaker 1  15:08
and that's fine, it's but the curve percentage is based on what we can get out of the pieces

Matthias Miller  15:20
correct. So if you have a

Matthias Miller  15:28
well, if you have a you have a half, let's see. What is this like if you have a half if you have a half inch, cutting a 7/16 out of a half inch, right, then you have six and a quarter percent curve.

Speaker 1  15:53
Correct? Yeah. Wouldn't it be easier, just to call it the dimension, with the curve,

Matthias Miller  16:05
we don't have

Speaker 1  16:07
like, like you were doing random. In other words,

Matthias Miller  16:15
we could, yeah, thinking. So basically,

Speaker 1  16:25
well, 7/16, is point 4375, decimal point point 4375, but actual out of a six inch can it's point six. So point 4375, becomes point six. They're not all that simple. Some of them is a simple number, half inches, point five becomes point 667,

Unknown Speaker  16:52
da, da. So I don't, um,

Unknown Speaker  16:59
I don't care either way, but

Speaker 1  17:08
I guess the formula looks easier if we say point five is point six, seven versus I'm just trying to talk through this.

Unknown Speaker  17:20
Sure it's not a waste.

Unknown Speaker  17:22
So go ahead, if

Matthias Miller  17:29
Would you just say this is the yield, but priced it as if it were this size? Yeah, that'd be fine. I It's, I mean, we haven't put any of that stuff in anyway. Yeah, sixth of one and a half dozen of the other, I What, what I would push for is, I mean, the rule of thumb I would use is what makes the most sense to you guys, because the math is just math. I mean,

Speaker 1  17:58
yeah, no, it's simply, simply, if it's 7/16 we're gonna call it point six, you know, like if, yeah, we're just gonna, we're always gonna call it point unless It's random, then we will call point five. But

Matthias Miller  18:22
see, Emily checks

Speaker 1  18:28
and I, and I think that would be good. Well, I'll, I'll wait till your Yeah, the be I

Matthias Miller  18:46
want to check something here so.

Matthias Miller  18:55
So with these always round to 16th dimensions as well

Speaker 1  19:02
to what dimensions did? What was that you said 16th

Matthias Miller  19:07
wood, the numbers that you use? Yeah, no,

Speaker 1  19:15
no, no, the measurements that we use, we use 16th every once in a while, we use a 32nd that's been in the past as dimension for tape, tape measure to the lumber, lumber size. But we've never used decimal points. So we've never used decimal points on our papers, on our print but for pricing with the curve, that's when we apply the decimal point number. It okay, because it's 100% accurate, right?

Matthias Miller  20:08
And you'd want it to four decimal points,

Unknown Speaker  20:13
sure, three or four.

Matthias Miller  20:19
And then don't you need to is it always applied to the thickness, or is it sometimes applied to the width?

Unknown Speaker  20:32
Yeah, four is actually good. Matt, sorry, but

Unknown Speaker  20:36
thickness, yeah, width, um,

Speaker 1  20:42
the question. Was about kerf on the width, or about dimensional dimensions that we use for width,

Matthias Miller  20:50
curve on the width?

Speaker 1  20:55
Yeah, because so there's times where we'll cut, you know, there's jobs that we've ran. They've asked for three and three quarter or three and seven eighths for the runner size, or even 358, and we'll have to take that out of a four inch. Can't, yep. And so that would then become four. As far as I know. We don't have any of those in our Well, no, I'm not, that's not true.

Unknown Speaker  21:25
There are.

Speaker 1  21:28
I'm pretty sure there's a few with new hall, and there may be some other ones. We're cutting three and three quarter that we're probably taking out of a four by six. Okay, I know there was a job we used to do a lot of we ran three and 7/8, poplar runners out of four by eight. Poplar, that was three and seven, eight. So that would have been, yeah, so there may be some I don't know, currently, okay, do

Matthias Miller  22:03
then, when you're setting this up, you're setting the yield size, you're setting the quantity per canned or the quantity per two by and Then the what do you call these dimensions? Is it just, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  22:28
um, yeah, it's, it's, it's the lumber with the curve, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1  22:43
Yep. Or size with size with curve. You know, lumber size with curve would be, yeah, lumber size with curve

Matthias Miller  23:00
when really it would be, we'll split it apart so we'd have can't, can't thickness with curve, can't width with curve, and then dimensional number, thickness with curve, dimension number, width With curve, if it can be cut out of that,

Speaker 1  23:23
it's, it's the shoot, yeah, I mean, we, we're calling it in the item data. You're calling it thickness, width and length, right, correct. So it'd be, if you can, I don't know if that thickness with curve, width with curve and the length width curve.

Matthias Miller  23:56
How does curve get calculated on lengths?

Speaker 1  24:01
It would be the that cheat sheet that I sent over. Did I email that to you?

Matthias Miller  24:16
Maybe, but I'm not sure which one you probably did, but I'm not sure which one right

Speaker 1  24:20
on Tina, let me see Here, Pat, maybe I didn't just see 113,

Unknown Speaker  24:39
wow, cool. On grief if I didn't or did Amanda send it over tech shoot?

Unknown Speaker  24:59
Did Amanda send. That over

Matthias Miller  25:03
in January, sometime or before that,

Speaker 1  25:06
man, I'd say in the last Yeah, in January.

Matthias Miller  25:11
Let me just look at all attachments from you guys in January. So I've got, I

Matthias Miller  25:28
those are calendar events. Maybe not. There's the there's the can't stop PDF that has cans cut back, play with SPF and the sub categories. It's not, it's it. None of that. Not bad. It's terrible. I'm not I'm not seeing it. It's the

Speaker 1  25:55
it's a breakdown of what we would round the links to based on cutting it out of an eight footer, 10 foot or 1214, or 16. And so with the idea that we have all five of those sizes available, then you look at all the different increments that we cut. So it's rounded up to the best yield out of one of those five lengths. Okay, that's the verbal answer. Though I could send I can send one over that would it's

Matthias Miller  26:41
and that's based on Canson cutbacks, or that would apply to cancer cutbacks,

Unknown Speaker  26:49
that would apply to Yeah,

Speaker 1  26:55
so in other words, the length of any item that we sell here would be rounded, always rounded up to the next increment.

Matthias Miller  27:07
Do two guys use different increments?

Speaker 1  27:12
It's going to be the same thing, okay? Like, we have to charge, you know, like, if you're cutting a 40 out of a two, anyway, it's the same thing.

Matthias Miller  27:21
Yeah, okay, good.

Speaker 1  27:26
Let me go back to your the dentist wants me to come at 1030 to put that crown back on. And that feels, oh boy, awkward right now, because we're in the middle of this, I could try to see if I could call, see if the if I can go later. Let me see here.

Matthias Miller  27:51
I mean, I'm good. It's, it's, it's just going to be a matter of jumping straight back into that document and just keep going. We got good stuff here that surfaced.

Speaker 1  28:01
Yes, yes. 100% do you? Do you? Does it matter to you if I jump back on with you later?

Matthias Miller  28:11
No, just ping me. Do you have an idea what it's going to

Speaker 1  28:16
be if I go down there and come back, who's gonna meet with Rick and then meet with George at 1230 if that's okay, but I can rearrange loose. I can definitely

Matthias Miller  28:30
no, that's fine. So like one, one ish, yeah, yeah, your time, yeah, again, just, just ping me. I've got flexibility

Unknown Speaker  28:39
today. All right, that's awesome.

Matthias Miller  28:41
Okay, sounds good. Well, good.

Unknown Speaker  28:44
I mean, I have five minutes, yeah, you

Matthias Miller  28:46
got five minutes yet. Okay, so running up the links, is there somebody who can that? Somebody, somebody else have that, who can email that over?

Speaker 1  28:54
Absolutely, yeah, good grief, yes. 100% I, in my mind I did it, but,

Unknown Speaker  29:05
well, good, or I wanted to do it a bunch of times. Um, yeah,

Matthias Miller  29:15
what else? Okay, so, I mean, I think that's so then curve we're thinking of as. So then when we translate to my thought is that will translate, first of all, from yield dimensions to actual dimensions with curve for two buys will then translate that into dimensional lumber.

Speaker 1  29:48
I'm sorry, let me. Let me catch up to you. Yield Curve dimensions and yield dimensions.

Matthias Miller  29:56
Okay, so we start with yield we're. We add curve to get the the raw material dimensions, and then we and then after that, for two buys, we okay my rationale and tell me if this is wrong. But my rationale is that it makes sense to me that two bys only use two by four pricing, or two by pricing, nominal dimensions when it comes to pricing, and that anywhere else within the system, when you say a two by, you'll label it as a two by, but we'll treat, treat it as a like yield and things like that will be actual dimensions. Is that fair?

Speaker 1  30:47
No, no, that's good. Yes. Okay,

Matthias Miller  30:50
so, but then for pricing purposes, I don't care how we do this, it's your choice. What makes most sense to you. We can either convert the finished dimensions to nominal dimensions. So if we end up with an inch and a half by three and a half, we call it a two by four and get the board footage off of that. Or we can say or we can convert the 68 and a half to the whatever it ends up being, you know, better than I do the 90 cents that is per actual board foot.

Speaker 1  31:33
Can you say that one more time that? Yes, apologize,

Matthias Miller  31:40
it's sorry, it's it's so if you, if you're working with the two by and you're pricing a two by, you can approach it two ways. You can say, well, I have an inch and a half by three and a half. That translates into a two by four, and then multiply that by the square the board footage of that by the price. Or you can say, well, I have an inch and a half by three and a half. And the price for nominal dimensions is 68 and a half. But the price for actual dimensions is 90, or whatever the number is, 90 cents a board foot. Yeah, we're going to use the 90 cents and multiply the actual board footage by the 90 cents.

Speaker 1  32:23
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So is it the nominal price, or is it the actual Is it the price based on the nominal dimension, or price based on actual dimension? I don't know, ask some greedy freaking corporate America guru. I Sorry.

Matthias Miller  32:40
Good. Okay. I mean, if you don't care, go ahead,

Speaker 1  32:46
yeah, I I don't care. I think whatever is the, what's the most functional, what's the what's the most efficient,

Unknown Speaker  32:57
long term,

Matthias Miller  33:00
what makes the most sense is to say, Listen, two by fours are weird because of these greedy corporate people. And we'll give you a way to input the the nominal board price. But under the hood, we'll store the I need to make sure we've got enough precision for this. But under the hood, we'll use the price based off of actual board price. We'll convert it into an actual

Speaker 1  33:27
board price that is, that is actually probably, I like that because I would like to Yeah, because we need to think of it like, yeah, in a world where, in a world where you're you're getting charged by actual dimensions, somebody comes and charges you for nominal dimensions. That's just messed up.

Matthias Miller  33:53
It's messed up that talks about screwing with reality.

Speaker 1  33:56
How did that ever happen? Hold it. That's me, um, I've been buying lumber the last Well, anyway, I got involved because, because I had to. But, um, yeah, it's, it's an, it's a world I could get into it. But like, Yeah, I mean, people were out there. It's just making phone calls, trying to find contact through some friends. And yep, here I got four different numbers, and I started banging phone calls and emails and this and that, and got a load coming this week, another load next week, and I got a couple other loads that they're trying to sell me. And yeah, the guy that George was working with, his loads are three, four weeks later, it didn't show up. Don't know what happened with that, but, um, it's an interesting world, man, you know? Then they're like, Oh yeah, the yellow pine price has been the same for two years, and now it's, it's just going up now, and everybody's gotta, you know, anyway, again, it proves the point where you're like, when, when it feels like the price is low. And it feels like it's probably going to go up, stock up, stock up, if you can. I've been trying to, I've been trying to, I've been

Speaker 2  35:09
talking about that. I've been speaking that out for the last couple years.

Speaker 1  35:13
And it's just another one of the, of the of the I or whatever dinosaur system ideas that I'm facing here. But um,

Matthias Miller  35:33
oh, you gotta, yep, you gotta think like an accountant to do that. I gotta let you go. But yeah, I, I there's two stories, super quick, two stories on that one was, there's a manufacturer that got their cash flowing, trying to cash flow, the purchase of the business, and their cost of goods jumped like 8% and they and the owner freaked, and was like, Why didn't we make any money? And their buying habits changed. The GM didn't know anything about procurement, really. Example one, example two is like, yeah, anyway, let's give example two, but like, it's a real thing, like, it's basically dollars in the bank, if you can negotiate a lower rate,

Speaker 1  36:14
oh, my goodness, yeah, I could, yeah. Like, we have, I mean, it's what these Amish guys do with these, like Farm Stores, and we've got a couple guys here that are, it's called paneling sales. The guy used to sell paneling and nails, and they started selling building materials, and now it's just, you know, I mean, he they're just making bank on this. I mean, these guys are making bank, and they're, they're cheaper than anybody else, and it's like, man, Pan link sales. But they're just, they're lot, they're buying lots, and they're and they've got connections, and they're figured it out. All you need is you need, you need some, you need capital, cash or whatever. Yeah, anyway, yeah. And they're selling it cheaper than, than, than Home Depot, or all the building material, all the all the building yards around here, all the lumber yards around here. They're cheaper.

Matthias Miller  37:05
That's crazy. Yeah, that's crazy.

Unknown Speaker  37:07
They're putting like, the

Speaker 1  37:08
one company, musclemans over New Holland. They were the top they were top of the line, man, customer service and everything else. And all of a sudden they're, I'm just hearing rumblings about musselmans, but I you go to paneling sales like, there's you can't really get in the parking spot. It's crazy.

Matthias Miller  37:25
That's crazy, all right.

Unknown Speaker  37:27
I gotta go. I'll talk. I'll ping you. See ya. Thanks. Yep, sounds good. See.
