Unknown Speaker  00:37
Yo yo yo yo yo what is wrong with you stupid phone hung you up and you keep buzzing

Matthias Miller  00:52
Hey doing that happens

Unknown Speaker  00:54
oh no three CX man i i love them and I hate them

Matthias Miller  01:01
well you know the weight the key the key to having a phone provider you don't hate this paying more money sad but true interesting

Unknown Speaker  01:15
is that is that your sage wisdom for the day?

Matthias Miller  01:19
That's the best I can offer

Unknown Speaker  01:23
it must be a Tuesday. All right,

Speaker 1  01:26
I have things I want to talk about before we dive back into logistics.

Unknown Speaker  01:32
Okay okay

Speaker 1  01:37
share your screen and go to

Speaker 2  01:42
shared logistics folder Ohio reports all right.

Matthias Miller  01:50
Browse while I'm pulling that up. Huge when I did some finagling. And we got our this morning Tori of Marissa accidentally got responded to a lead time in less than two minutes. And this afternoon Tory got her email alert and responded also within two minutes, so it's not 14 seconds, but we're gonna get this thing dialed in

Matthias Miller  02:21
Okay, where do

Speaker 1  02:23
i Let's go unscheduled first. Okay. Okay, I want you to read this subset. And I want you to tell me the macro the scheduling macro subset, I'll do that thing. Okay. Okay. Here is what I don't quite understand. Lindsey claims that if a building does not have a deadline date it will not show up. Ideally what I want to happen is that if we if a deadline date is not involved that the building will still show up once it is built in the list now as you read this Do you agree or disagree that that's what should happen

Matthias Miller  03:17
if it has a deadline date but is not built it should be in the list

Unknown Speaker  03:21
but what if it is not built and has no deadline date?

Matthias Miller  03:39
It's not built in no deadline it will not be included I don't think let's do this.

Unknown Speaker  03:44
What about if it's built and has no deadline date?

Matthias Miller  03:48
I'm gonna I'm gonna make my life easy okay. So we're gonna do is in a building built date and is in a building

Unknown Speaker  04:05
so this is

Unknown Speaker  04:06
it's building real deadline date

Matthias Miller  04:12
okay I'm building steppin

Speaker 1  04:16
and and exclude for for non district X

Unknown Speaker  04:21
Hey, go

Matthias Miller  04:30
okay, so it's just a guy X. Why don't you Why don't you like about that?

Speaker 1  04:36
Oh, you need the parameter? Yeah, the vs for days thing.

Matthias Miller  04:42
Let's do like, do I want 3000 or something?

Speaker 1  04:46
It doesn't matter. I guess it doesn't matter. So did 10 days 10 days was the kind of the, the standard currently.

Matthias Miller  04:56
Okay, so if they're both blank, it's not in there. If you have a deadline date, it's not in there. Well, in this case, it's gonna find out what the deadline date is. Building ID building num ID

Unknown Speaker  05:23
some of these are

Matthias Miller  05:26
okay, so let's try this again. There's if they're both blank, there's nothing. There is a deadline in the future. We exclude

Unknown Speaker  05:42
we include

Matthias Miller  05:50
mean Yeah, then we only include them up to 10 days in the future. So these are too far out. This one's past. Past past past. 21 We should see a to give any 10 We don't have any 1030 ones 11. Other ones.

Speaker 2  06:12
Include, include? Okay, not building mucho giving it is? So

Speaker 1  06:21
if I'm reading, correct, correct. If there's no building all that way, so it's not

Matthias Miller  06:31
if the raw JSON data is blank, it's not included. Okay,

Speaker 1  06:36
but what if what if the raw deadline date is blank, but the building is excellent. The building build date is not is is actually filled in? I can't. It's okay. Okay.

Matthias Miller  06:50
So if it's built in no deadline, it shows up.

Unknown Speaker  06:59
Why does she consistently

Unknown Speaker  06:59
say they're not showing up?

Matthias Miller  07:02
Does she have a particular building? That's not showing up? That's a good question. Because that would really help us out.

Unknown Speaker  07:11
Okay, well, let's

Unknown Speaker  07:16
let's do this. Let's go. Let's pull up her scheduling window.

Unknown Speaker  07:19
Okay.

Unknown Speaker  07:22
Keep that keep that lovely stuff open.

Matthias Miller  07:27
So this would be

Unknown Speaker  07:29
window two, dash two.

Matthias Miller  07:33
Window two dash two. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  07:36
So let's do this. Oh, well. Okay,

Matthias Miller  07:43
hang on so then we're going to do

Matthias Miller  08:10
Okay, so here the ones that are not included in the

Speaker 2  08:18
build date, but no deadline. So she's what okay. What there it is.

Matthias Miller  08:27
Okay, so then why is this one not included? That's a whole other question. Because the building was cancelled.

Unknown Speaker  08:34
Where do you see that? I mean,

Speaker 1  08:37
which one do you select? Okay, building this. Okay, got it. Okay, that makes sense. Let's go to the next No, go to the go to the John. John.

Speaker 2  08:46
Chris. That's gonna exclude for quotes. Okay.

Matthias Miller  09:00
Okay, so then this guy canceled, canceled

Unknown Speaker  09:10
ready to build.

Speaker 1  09:12
Okay, but okay, no deadline date and not built, which we said will not show up. But why doesn't it have a deadline date? That's interesting. Oh, the sales order is canceled. Oh, and the builder has no builder. Okay, so fine. That technically is canceled. Obviously, somebody didn't do that correctly. Go ahead and click that thing. Edit that hit the top window and edit that thing and click Cancel.

Unknown Speaker  09:36
Because that's what should be done. Bingo. Save that.

Matthias Miller  09:42
Okay, and same with this. This one too. This one's canceled. Oh, the buildings now campus buildings canceled. Okay, hold on one second.

Unknown Speaker  10:36
YEAH? All right, we're going to try and create the scenario since okay so let's do this

Speaker 1  12:55
I'm going to go take some lot buildings that currently have no deadline date

Speaker 2  13:01
let me go find some which I know there are TPR report district of Ohio Okay? deadline date okay, what's the story on this guy? Not built no deadline Interesting. Okay, this snot lot building that I don't like that a lot building this go down here. Here we go all right, I'm going

Speaker 1  14:13
to I'm going to put two buildings up. I'm going to give them a I'm going to give them a build date of today. Save that and add it today save that now. Refresh yours and we're hunting I'm going to give you two stin numbers to hunt for

Unknown Speaker  14:37
data when you're ready Yep, ready?

Unknown Speaker  14:39
As 2207768 Whoa,

Matthias Miller  14:49
well, we're gonna do

Unknown Speaker  14:52
I mean, you could you could you could.

Speaker 1  14:54
You could exclude these both in Ohio so we could exclude for district of Ohio but there it is. 7768

Matthias Miller  15:03
Sorry, says it should be included let's go pull it for window

Unknown Speaker  15:08
and see there it is.

Matthias Miller  15:17
Where is it? It's an

Unknown Speaker  15:18
it's a lot building I mean it was

Matthias Miller  15:22
scheduled Yeah. Okay.

Speaker 1  15:27
All right. We're gonna we're gonna go with that for now

Matthias Miller  15:33
as soon as she can find a building that's not showing up and it should

Speaker 1  15:39
note Yes, exactly. All right, we're gonna have him in the building. Yep, got it. Okay. Okay, next thing I want to go dig around for if we go back to the original report that I started out with I'm trying to do a sword that is not correct and I'm not sure what to do how to do this but exactly go into that. Let's look at that. Here's what I'm trying to do I want the newest units to always be at the top of my report based on two different things if it if it does not have a sales order date, which means it's a lot building or if it does not have a sales order sale date. Then I want to look at the building entry date but if it has a sales order date I want to have it I want the this the so sale date so I don't

Unknown Speaker  16:36
Oh man, I was so close.

Matthias Miller  16:39
I mean you were actually really close here you could have just done a I think probably what you want it was just uh but okay,

Speaker 1  16:48
here's the weird part is it's doing something funny with lat buildings with my with my if statement because the if I'm if I'm evaluating for building entry date, it was the it was not it was giving me like the oldest building entry date at the top of that when instead of the newest one. And it was counterintuitive to me and I wasn't sure what I was doing wrong. So run this thing. Let's go down and look at lot buildings.

Unknown Speaker  17:17
What buildings?

Speaker 1  17:20
Let's, what's the Okay, built on eight, nine? Okay, eight, eight, scroll down. Scroll down to the very, very last one.

Unknown Speaker  17:27
Okay. Why did it?

Matthias Miller  17:35
Okay, let's take this out. Let me see what let me see what it was before. I'm confused what even that wouldn't have worked. But

Unknown Speaker  17:43
at in 2018

Matthias Miller  17:47
I'm still not seeing why your original report didn't work. Oops.

Matthias Miller  18:04
So here we're looking on deadline.

Unknown Speaker  18:08
We're on the lot building. Okay, scroll to the bottom. I tend to

Speaker 1  18:16
I might look misread the year, that might have been the issue. But I mean, essentially those those 10 No, no, that's right. That's right.

Matthias Miller  18:27
Wait, here's one.

Unknown Speaker  18:28
Yeah, well, what? This goes out of line? Yeah. Why is he on line?

Matthias Miller  18:40
Do you have? Are you showing the SOA entry date on these?

Speaker 1  18:44
They should well potentially. Okay, what is that? What is this? There is no sales order.

Matthias Miller  18:50
Okay, so then let's go ahead and do the date string and see if that resolves. It resolves it. That at least gives you the peace of mind that you weren't going crazy if that's actually what it was. No, it's still good. Let's go find that way.

Unknown Speaker  19:14
Let's do

Matthias Miller  19:17
this and not save it in this and not save it.

Unknown Speaker  19:30
At 11 builds on

Matthias Miller  19:35
building entry date, that's not the entry date. It's the build. Build on is the build date.

Unknown Speaker  19:42
Not the entry date.

Matthias Miller  19:45
You want to sort by build date or entry to hold on,

Unknown Speaker  19:47
hold on, hold on. Hold on, um, you know,

Speaker 1  19:54
it is entry date. We're looking at Build date entry date. Okay, so essentially let's go look Add, let's go look at the first one in line and look at its entry date. And let's go look at the one that's showing out of line with the deadline date is really irrelevant. That's not what I wanted to look at. I'm not.

Matthias Miller  20:12
I'm saying so let's go look at we got this one.

Speaker 1  20:15
Yes, go ahead, actually go ahead and add the column building entry date. And let's this way we can evaluate correctly.

Matthias Miller  20:22
So building entry date. Yeah, that's that's the, that's I'm 90%. Sure, that's the issue. But here we have 8885 715. For some reason, this

Speaker 1  20:37
guy, I know exactly what to scroll, scroll all the way to the bottom right here at the bottom. Yeah, I saw the 831 and missed the 2018. And thought I was I thought it was because the very, very top stuff is August 2022. And that's 2018. And I my mind read Whoa, this is out of line. I think it was me. I mean, us put the correct logic in so that we're, we're good.

Matthias Miller  21:00
Okay, let me throw in my changes. I mean, it's, it's actually, the only thing is just making it. Your logic is actually correct. It's just can be simplified a little bit. Yeah. That sale date if it's sold, otherwise, entry date.

Unknown Speaker  21:32
Cool. Sweet. Okay,

Speaker 1  21:34
that's happy. All right. Now. What did I text in a student's talk about scheduled tasks? Yes. Scheduled tasks. Do scheduled tasks, the report that's tied into a scheduled task. Does it have to be a standard report?

Matthias Miller  21:53
Okay, no, I know somebody who is you know, doing something like this.

Unknown Speaker  22:04
So, yeah, okay. Um,

Speaker 1  22:08
I've never done a scheduled task and I'm a little scared of doing one for the first time.

Matthias Miller  22:12
Okay, what do you want to schedule? Well, okay,

Speaker 1  22:14
so here's what I want to schedule is those two reports that we were just looking at? I want to export them as an email to files it inside automation as Excel files.

Unknown Speaker  22:24
Those those two in that in that folder?

Matthias Miller  22:29
Do you want this recorded? Do you want this in a separate recordings? You can go back and look at it or?

Unknown Speaker  22:33
Yes, please. That'd be awesome.
