There's an observation that one of the blocks that I was experiencing yesterday was related towards nailing down software companies as the avatar and who I actually want to work with and work for. That's observation number one. And then observation number two is this whole thing of this whole systems training that I've put together is actually the star principle combination of people and systems and being able to speak both languages. And then being able to share that with with other people and a very interesting place to start would be to be able to share this as a training with with investigators, their management teams
