Unknown Speaker  00:01
So these are a few

Speaker 1  00:01
observations about what I've been listening to and judges. First of all, that it's interesting again, just to see the cycle, and how they tolerated things until somebody, somebody rose up and, and did something about that and then checked it themselves into the situation. And sometimes you have to inject yourself into a situation to be able to move, able to move past that.

Speaker 1  00:29
That's, that's the first thing. The other thing that was really interesting was that

Unknown Speaker  00:36
there were

Speaker 1  00:37
okay. And actually with that some of these cycles became, because people were entrenched in,

Speaker 1  00:46
in their lands, they have enemies who were actually in trench with it within there. And I think a lot of the patterns that you see is that when people aren't doing well, where they go in cycles, it's because they have an enemy that they have not be thrown. And so one of the questions is,

Unknown Speaker  01:05
how do you how do you dethrone

Speaker 1  01:06
that, that enemy? And and, you know,

Unknown Speaker  01:10
that's the? That's a big question. It's like,

Speaker 1  01:14
you gotta, you gotta do it, you gotta, you gotta kill kill stuff.

Speaker 1  01:20
So its first thought is, the next thing was that there was a generation that arose that didn't know war. And it was important enough, that they learn where they got actually orchestrated them to be in battle. And because he wanted them to learn to fight, and he wanted to them to learn battle strategies. And so maybe realize that as you look through judges, one of the lessons is, especially in that that timeframe is there are lessons on how to fight war.

Speaker 1  01:49
And some of the stories of how they they got rid of other people are actually lessons of work there how to fight. A good example is this guy, the guy who the really fat guy

Unknown Speaker  02:00
who has somebody else came in and the left

Speaker 1  02:03
hander, and they, they stabbed him in the stomach and lost the dagger and is fat and all that kind of stuff.

Speaker 1  02:12
That story is, it contains the lessons of war. And when there's when there is a, first of all,

Speaker 1  02:21
there's an 8020 and all war, there's a kingpin, that if you can uproot and dismantle the kingpin, then you can, you can gain

Speaker 1  02:33
the victory that you're looking for. so in this situation, this was a

Unknown Speaker  02:42
Come on.

Unknown Speaker  02:55
In this situation, there was a

Speaker 1  02:59
question King, who was the king can for all of these tormentors. And you see the

Unknown Speaker  03:07
20th play in both directions? First

Unknown Speaker  03:10
of all,

Unknown Speaker  03:11
the 8020 in terms of

Speaker 1  03:15
who's the kingpin and who do you need to dethrone that's number one, but the other 8020 that you see,

Unknown Speaker  03:21
is the guy who

Unknown Speaker  03:22
was actually brave enough to come up with a strategy

Speaker 1  03:23
and to outsmart him? And to

Unknown Speaker  03:29
take them out? That's the

Speaker 1  03:31
other 8020 that you see. So what is the lessons before I think one of the lessons of war is that is that there are extraordinary acts of courage that yield extraordinary results.

Unknown Speaker  03:47
And

Speaker 1  03:47
these are not for normal. Normal.

Speaker 1  03:53
Business as usual, does not. This is not quantifiable. I don't know what I'm trying to, I'm losing losing it. But this is not just business as usual.

Speaker 1  04:02
This is a designed tactic to to,

Unknown Speaker  04:07
to uproot stuff.

Unknown Speaker  04:09
Second of all, that there are key

Speaker 1  04:13
ki, Ki, ki ki, if you uproot that person, then the entire enemies enemies scatters because there is no succession plans today. They are the succession plan, or they are the plan.

Speaker 1  04:29
And so just as an example, if you're going after a specific market, there is one or two kingpins, or there probably is one thing

Speaker 1  04:38
that you have to dethrone and when you dethrone that the kingdom is yours.

Speaker 1  04:47
This also applies to spiritual for you that there are spiritual roots.

Unknown Speaker  04:53
That if you can dethrone

Speaker 1  04:55
one thing, that all of a sudden, this whole, there's this whole range of all the little things that go falling by the wayside, because you've actually dealt with the real King. So there's that.

Speaker 1  05:11
I'm trying to think what 30 is, seems to me like there's a

Unknown Speaker  05:17
there is

Speaker 1  05:17
a secrecy that is important in a war. So when you're in war,

Speaker 1  05:25
your your knowledge is your competitive advantage.

Speaker 1  05:31
I had to think of an example, in terms of

Unknown Speaker  05:36
one of the

Unknown Speaker  05:44
there was a key that

Speaker 1  05:48
there's a king that was complaining about a spy being and his men. And it wasn't actually even about the spy, it was because

Unknown Speaker  05:59
the prophet of God was getting the downloads

Speaker 1  06:02
on their information. And this was

Speaker 1  06:05
their competitive advantage. It wasn't, it was a brute force, although sometimes brute force

Unknown Speaker  06:10
is, is a competitive advantage. But sometimes,

Unknown Speaker  06:14
sometimes the advantage

Unknown Speaker  06:15
is the

Unknown Speaker  06:21
sometimes the advantage

Unknown Speaker  06:24
is, is the

Unknown Speaker  06:25
knowledge that you gain, and the fact that

Unknown Speaker  06:27
when you have knowledge of your enemy,

Speaker 1  06:32
they are in the dark about you. But you have complete transparency about them. So you know exactly what

Speaker 1  06:39
they're doing. And they have no clue what you're up to. And it's just another interesting aspect. trying to think what else?

Unknown Speaker  06:48
What else there was?

Speaker 1  06:51
Anyway, so those are some of the lessons it really made me curious to think about what some of the other lessons of more as and other things about how you actually fight? There's another fairly obvious one here is that there were this was interesting, but Well, first of all,

Unknown Speaker  07:07
there were

Speaker 1  07:09
there's a dependence on the voice of the Lord to win back. So

Speaker 1  07:15
you know, should I go, should I go here, so fight this battle. That's, that's number one. But number two was that there were actually different battles that were assigned

Speaker 1  07:22
to different people. And in one situation, we saw

Unknown Speaker  07:26
a battle, a victory was given

Speaker 1  07:28
to somebody before the battle. And they invited their brother,

Unknown Speaker  07:32
their tribe,

Speaker 1  07:35
to participate in the battle, share the victory, and then they would

Unknown Speaker  07:40
share the victory of the other battle, but the success

Unknown Speaker  07:42
was already

Speaker 1  07:44
given to one person. So without actually partnering with that person, there was no success in battle.

Unknown Speaker  07:58
This is why

Unknown Speaker  08:00
you see certain people

Speaker 1  08:03
trying to achieve certain things. And then one person comes along, and the success

Unknown Speaker  08:09
belongs to them.

Speaker 1  08:13
Everybody else rides along on their success, because it's their inheritance.

Speaker 1  08:19
I think this is partially part of what we actually saw with, with, with my mom and the leadership team, that's

Speaker 1  08:24
part of my inheritance. is is this is just life in the spirit. And when I was engaged with them, and we were in relationship over that, in in, we're in a relationship they shared

Speaker 1  08:42
in that inheritance. And they want because it was my inheritance.

Unknown Speaker  08:49
There's actually this

Unknown Speaker  08:50
other interesting thing, that one of the ways

Unknown Speaker  08:53
that we share

Unknown Speaker  08:56
the share the blessings and the spoils of war

Unknown Speaker  09:01
is by

Speaker 1  09:07
one of the ways we started flushes the spoils of war is by entering into relationship with with people who need what we have to offer.
