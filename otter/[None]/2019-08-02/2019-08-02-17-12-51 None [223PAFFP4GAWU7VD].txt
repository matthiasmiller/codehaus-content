I know it's the weekend,

Unknown Speaker  00:02
just leaving work actually left a little early. I

Unknown Speaker  00:05
know it doesn't seem a little early but and probably could

Unknown Speaker  00:09
have left us earlier in fact, but

Speaker 1  00:11
just wanted to thank you for, for your instincts and your contribution to how I run and structure my life. I'm not a structure oriented person, but your input has definitely been a huge boost. And it's feels good to be going home

Speaker 1  00:28
and have the whole weekend off and knowing that I've actually put in more than what was actually needed or what you know

Unknown Speaker  00:35
what I needed to get done. So

Unknown Speaker  00:37
Appreciate you appreciate what you bring.

Speaker 1  00:42
appreciate you helping me out with with this stuff. And

Unknown Speaker  00:45
if you have an awesome weekend Thanks again.
