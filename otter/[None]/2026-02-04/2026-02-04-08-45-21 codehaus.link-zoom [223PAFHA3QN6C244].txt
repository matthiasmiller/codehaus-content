Unknown Speaker  01:02
Yo, hello. Can you

Unknown Speaker  01:06
hear me?

Unknown Speaker  01:08
There's a strange sound. I don't think it's coming from your How about that?

Unknown Speaker  01:14
I think somebody forgot to turn the heat on the conference room. I just went and got a water bottle

Unknown Speaker  01:20
of water. It's like freezing, literally, from the refrigerator.

Unknown Speaker  01:24
My conference room is a refrigerator

Unknown Speaker  01:27
that's that's great.

Unknown Speaker  01:36
All right, here simple mount

Unknown Speaker  01:59
Yeah, all right, let me we're

Unknown Speaker  02:01
not handle handling the cash price percentage correctly here, so I'm going to stub something in and we'll See how close it is.

Unknown Speaker  02:12
But

Unknown Speaker  02:15
rapid, it's this times.

Unknown Speaker  02:34
This guy should be the

Unknown Speaker  02:54
All Right,

Unknown Speaker  02:58
come on.

Unknown Speaker  03:09
Happy now,

Unknown Speaker  03:27
you know, I'm ready for spring.

Unknown Speaker  03:32
This, this cold weather is

Unknown Speaker  03:36
I have oftentimes convinced Lee, tried to convince Lee, end up that we should move somewhere where we get a lot more snow, and now I'm rethinking, rethinking my life choices.

Unknown Speaker  03:49
My wife was back in Lancaster this past weekend.

Unknown Speaker  03:53
Oh, gracious. Oh my goodness, you will literally get a mental illness from going there. It's terrible. The the overcast, icky weather, oh my goodness.

Unknown Speaker  04:11
I think Colorado would actually be perfect, because it's like you can go from six inches to snow of snow to 60 degrees in the same day.

Unknown Speaker  04:20
Yeah, we hit the record a year or two ago where Denver went from post went over 100 to under freezing in 24 hours. Oh, my goodness,

Unknown Speaker  04:34
that's, that's, that's pretty intense.

Unknown Speaker  04:38
Yeah, no kidding. I

Unknown Speaker  04:48
All right, so I'm

Unknown Speaker  04:51
trying to decide whether I want to just run

Unknown Speaker  04:55
payments. How far did you get yesterday, after I had.

Unknown Speaker  05:00
Far, did we get yesterday? Well, we are. I thought I had this all working, and then cash price wasn't getting set, and

Unknown Speaker  05:09
then, so it's not really,

Unknown Speaker  05:12
it's not really going the way. I mean, the import didn't work.

Unknown Speaker  05:17
So this is what's running now. We should theoretically have invoices and invoices and itemization off of this import,

Unknown Speaker  05:27
so the main thing after that would then be

Unknown Speaker  05:29
payments.

Unknown Speaker  05:36
So we're going to do,

Unknown Speaker  05:38
ah, so you're incurring stuff right now is what you're doing. Yeah, incurring stuff. Can we write some

Unknown Speaker  05:45
imports that I can incur some other stuff? Exactly?

Unknown Speaker  05:56
I

Unknown Speaker  06:02
i

Unknown Speaker  06:37
So other many little pieces for contract entry are completely wrapped up. Contract invoices. We can import shot that has payments for contracts almost completely ready. There's a little bit of work that your auto pay works correctly.

Unknown Speaker  06:52
Okay?

Unknown Speaker  06:54
Seth.

Unknown Speaker  07:00
Let's go to that.

Unknown Speaker  07:14
Okay, so let's do

Unknown Speaker  07:17
this would be payments,

Unknown Speaker  07:21
getting the contract ID, auto Number, and then let's go to the payments. RG, I'm

Unknown Speaker  07:47
Oh, come on,

Unknown Speaker  07:54
really. I

Unknown Speaker  08:10
payments.

Unknown Speaker  08:19
All right,

Unknown Speaker  08:22
go. Contract invoices, contract invoice itemization, contract invoice credits, contract invoice payments. So

Unknown Speaker  08:34
what's different in the invoices and the itemization?

Unknown Speaker  08:38
The invoices, the invoice the itemization is the line items.

Unknown Speaker  08:54
Oh, this is going to get fun.

Unknown Speaker  09:10
Are we going to be creating I

Unknown Speaker  09:12
think the answer is no. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  09:15
let's let's just, well, you have to ask the actual question before I can before yes or no payment records for from

Unknown Speaker  09:30
from that place, RTO, pro,

Unknown Speaker  09:36
Are we going to be creating payment records,

Unknown Speaker  09:41
not following

Unknown Speaker  09:44
these guys.

Unknown Speaker  09:52
Are you saying? Are we going to, are we going to make payment records for every all the stuff we're importing? Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  10:06
I don't know that would be a question I would actually ask you. I

Unknown Speaker  11:50
in payment, right ID,

Unknown Speaker  11:53
invoice payment,

Unknown Speaker  11:56
there's the invoice royalty.

Unknown Speaker  11:58
Then we have a

Unknown Speaker  12:16
well, okay, I mean,

Unknown Speaker  12:26
we made progress.

Unknown Speaker  12:43
I

Unknown Speaker  12:49
You made progress, and then you show me

Unknown Speaker  12:52
1000 errors. Well, I mean, just 750

Unknown Speaker  12:57
I was I was guessing. I was close,

Unknown Speaker  13:02
yeah, 250

Unknown Speaker  13:11
Seth says we currently require a linked payment record. All

Unknown Speaker  13:16
right?

Unknown Speaker  13:24
Going to remember if this is a, let's try this actually, BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM. I

Unknown Speaker  13:31
think that's the wrong payment ID. Okay, so search

Unknown Speaker  13:35
contracts.

Unknown Speaker  13:40
Contracts,

Unknown Speaker  13:46
I don't know the rental company. Can you just

Unknown Speaker  13:56
now? I said contract ID, you're not listening.

Unknown Speaker  13:59
You listen to me, your life would be so hard.

Unknown Speaker  14:18
Contract Number one, oh,

Unknown Speaker  14:22
what?

Unknown Speaker  14:24
Oh,

Unknown Speaker  14:33
six years of your one

Unknown Speaker  14:35
you can run, but you can hide.

Unknown Speaker  14:41
Let me.

Unknown Speaker  14:58
03 rent item.

Unknown Speaker  15:05
A paid subtotal

Unknown Speaker  15:09
cannot be greater.

Unknown Speaker  15:21
Oh, well,

Unknown Speaker  15:25
well, that's Fun.

Unknown Speaker  15:57
I just a refund.

Unknown Speaker  16:09
Is zero would be no and one would be yes, right?

Unknown Speaker  16:12
Refund, no, I think that's where there was refunded.

Unknown Speaker  16:17
What do you mean?

Unknown Speaker  16:19
I think refund means, was it refunded? So how

Unknown Speaker  16:23
do you have a refund without it being refunded? The

Unknown Speaker  16:27
original payment would be marked refunded.

Unknown Speaker  16:31
So you what you want me to look it up in RTO, pro mind, contract, 10, 10754,

Unknown Speaker  16:38
store, four.

Unknown Speaker  17:13
Hello,

Unknown Speaker  17:15
what in the world,

Unknown Speaker  17:18
with the world

Unknown Speaker  17:21
that was weird.

Unknown Speaker  17:25
Oh, schnitzel pants.

Unknown Speaker  17:29
I had one of those when I was a kid. I

Unknown Speaker  17:35
don't know what they are, but

Unknown Speaker  17:38
how did I do that the other day? How did I do that. Let's go users,

Unknown Speaker  17:44
actions,

Unknown Speaker  17:48
connect.

Unknown Speaker  17:52
Schnitzel pants. I don't know where that one came from. Don't ask.

Unknown Speaker  17:58
Don't have an answer for you.

Unknown Speaker  18:04
Yeah, okay, we don't know what we do know, but who cares?

Unknown Speaker  18:13
10754,

Unknown Speaker  18:14
you said,

Unknown Speaker  18:18
Okay,

Unknown Speaker  18:22
this we have the right to pass in history, amount negative, 1464,

Unknown Speaker  18:40
is no, nothing, never nothing there.

Unknown Speaker  18:46
This is not good.

Unknown Speaker  18:52
What do you make of that?

Unknown Speaker  18:57
There's nothing there, nothing there store for

Unknown Speaker  19:02
yeah,

Unknown Speaker  19:05
here I give you

Unknown Speaker  19:08
share screen

Unknown Speaker  19:11
with control. You can come look yourself, since you don't believe

Unknown Speaker  19:20
me or Sure.

Unknown Speaker  19:28
Angelo,

Unknown Speaker  19:32
so we have a receipt. Let's check receipt number

Unknown Speaker  19:37
d do one, ending in 303 DDD, 01303,

Unknown Speaker  19:44
date correction,

Unknown Speaker  19:47
yikes. Is this the one? Though? Why would? Well, that's the that's the receipt number, right? D, 010003,

Unknown Speaker  19:55
or three, yeah. But I mean, is this, but can there be multiple? Can there be is there any.

Unknown Speaker  20:00
That other weird oddities going on,

Unknown Speaker  20:03
like it's 618, 21 Oh, go back, go back, go back, go back, go back. See that due date? Next due date.

Unknown Speaker  20:17
They moved it back,

Unknown Speaker  20:21
which apparently, if you went backwards, it tracks $1 value. That's interesting. How do I know it's a? I mean, is it a? Do we look at these trans types, transaction type? We did. Let's ask Claude. Claude,

Unknown Speaker  20:39
yeah, you have access. You look up.

Unknown Speaker  20:43
Can you look up? Ah, stop it

Unknown Speaker  20:47
here. Let me. Let me share this one. Okay, but before, before you do that, can you go to, can you go? Can you look up? Underneath the same account number for there's, there's another D receipt number, line 12.

Unknown Speaker  21:02
Let's see that. Let's see that. Six, 923,

Unknown Speaker  21:11
where was I?

Unknown Speaker  21:13
Where was I when the lights went out,

Unknown Speaker  21:17
623

Unknown Speaker  21:22
was six. Is it

Unknown Speaker  21:24
one of these? No, because

Unknown Speaker  21:28
it's completely that one was completely empty. Oh, but you that one had a $0 value, and that one went for that one went forward too.

Unknown Speaker  21:39
I mean, I could?

Unknown Speaker  21:45
We just did, if the if the contract,

Unknown Speaker  21:55
We go into history?

Unknown Speaker  22:20
And

Unknown Speaker  22:22
we are sick. Six this guy?

Unknown Speaker  22:30
Yeah, that would be a positive amount.

Unknown Speaker  22:34
So wait, he's tracking dollar values on due dates, but we can it. Okay. So are they all of those? Are those all D types?

Unknown Speaker  22:48
I mean, both of them aren't Okay, so let's look up D type transactions across the system and verify if they're all due date moves. We can straight up ignore the dollar values of them

Unknown Speaker  23:00
because they're due date moves.

Unknown Speaker  23:03
And he's, this is how he's tracking, this is how he tracks his free money.

Unknown Speaker  23:10
Yeah, he's tracking $1 value to it.

Unknown Speaker  23:14
That's crazy.

Unknown Speaker  23:17
And so like, like that. Whoa, that one right there that you're on.

Unknown Speaker  23:23
We were we fixed it 11, one to

Unknown Speaker  23:30
110,

Unknown Speaker  23:32
January of next year. Oh, somebody fat fingered or miss type Yeah, something, yeah. That's funny.

Unknown Speaker  23:40
Same thing here.

Unknown Speaker  23:43
We meant we went from Wait, we went from May to December, and then back again. That's wonky. 2023,

Unknown Speaker  23:57
yeah, again,

Unknown Speaker  24:01
boy, that year stuff, that's why you need warnings. Man.

Unknown Speaker  24:11
Oh, what's his $5,000 one?

Unknown Speaker  24:15
Oh,

Unknown Speaker  24:22
what? Is that? How do you get a how do you get a year of oh two?

Unknown Speaker  24:28
Constantine says you must be the shed

Unknown Speaker  24:34
we went. We went back to just before, just after the time of Christ, 200 years after the time of Christ.

Unknown Speaker  24:41
Uh, oh, that's funny.

Unknown Speaker  25:06
Well, there are some other bad ones too.

Unknown Speaker  25:13
Goodness gracious. I mean, that's just wrong. I

Unknown Speaker  25:24
any of them over, none of them over.

Unknown Speaker  25:37
That is crazy.

Unknown Speaker  25:45
Mean, some anyway,

Unknown Speaker  25:54
prove

Unknown Speaker  25:55
that cardio contracts.

Unknown Speaker  26:01
Ah, oh, man,

Unknown Speaker  26:06
well,

Unknown Speaker  26:07
okay,

Unknown Speaker  26:10
no due date changes.

Unknown Speaker  26:17
So we go

Unknown Speaker  26:20
this guy,

Unknown Speaker  26:24
that's going to be most of the negatives, actually, that's going to take a lot of care of A lot of stuff,

Unknown Speaker  26:35
records and

Unknown Speaker  26:58
lend it,

Unknown Speaker  27:02
cash, price is a required field.

Unknown Speaker  27:08
You talking about

Unknown Speaker  27:10
3512,

Unknown Speaker  27:20
I

Unknown Speaker  27:27
integrity, more space. Where are you? Oh,

Unknown Speaker  27:44
well, find out.

Unknown Speaker  28:00
I never have allergies, but boy, goodness, am I sneezing like crazy today.

Unknown Speaker  28:06
So you're, you're moving to the bank. Fell through.

Unknown Speaker  28:11
I thought about it. I'm like,

Unknown Speaker  28:13
I could save money. I was talking to my mom. My mom's a wise woman.

Unknown Speaker  28:19
I would be. I would have my own I would have my own office space, but I would still have a guy like

Unknown Speaker  28:27
in that same office, and he's just,

Unknown Speaker  28:31
I'd be kind of worried about I started thinking about all the things I love about this space here, basically, and

Unknown Speaker  28:39
she's like, you've Got enough going on in your life, in her opinion, this is her opinion, which I agreed with. She's like, you need a quiet space. It's just your own that just belongs, that just fits and like,

Unknown Speaker  28:51
anyway, I was like, you know,

Unknown Speaker  28:57
yeah, it's kind of funny, because my mom will say, she's like, we have these conversations. And she's like,

Unknown Speaker  29:04
I think ever and I are probably, I mean, we share differences, but I think we probably understand each other better than they've probably more similar than

Unknown Speaker  29:15
any of my siblings. So

Unknown Speaker  29:17
it's always fun to be able to bounce things off of her. I

Unknown Speaker  29:21
um,

Unknown Speaker  29:24
all right, so

Unknown Speaker  29:29
something happened.

Unknown Speaker  29:32
I'm lost right now. Um, why does this one not have a cash price percentage? We have

Unknown Speaker  29:42
58 58, month turbulence,

Unknown Speaker  29:45
huh?

Unknown Speaker  29:47
Oh,

Unknown Speaker  29:51
well, sales match, I doesn't it jet, I had to figure that one out though they have a chat. Hit,

Unknown Speaker  29:59
um.

Unknown Speaker  30:00
Yeah, but we shouldn't be. We shouldn't allow, how do we even allow the contract to get created?

Unknown Speaker  30:10
What?

Unknown Speaker  30:18
That's a good question, because apparently you can stomp in term length without

Unknown Speaker  30:24
so the question, okay, so here's the question, obviously,

Unknown Speaker  30:31
the Lord only knows what the entry date was, January the 12th.

Unknown Speaker  30:37
Oh, that's a new one. Is it all right? Let me go look this thing up. I'm gonna look it up. No, it's start date. No, no. Start dates, 513, 2020,

Unknown Speaker  30:48
yeah,

Unknown Speaker  30:51
oh yeah.

Unknown Speaker  30:53
Okay, so obviously there was some sort of something or other. Let's go see if I can figure out what the story is.

Unknown Speaker  31:00
What's the contract? Number

Unknown Speaker  31:04
3812 is the contract?

Unknown Speaker  31:07
3812

Unknown Speaker  31:10
Steven, Michael, Michael Steven Allen, or Michael Steven, Brad. This is cricket Valley, Brad,

Unknown Speaker  31:18
3512 oh, that's the account. No, that's account

Unknown Speaker  31:22
number, contract ID are the same? No, I don't

Unknown Speaker  31:26
wait 30. Wait, why is the contract IDs wrong?

Unknown Speaker  31:32
Well, this is from an old import.

Unknown Speaker  31:37
Is this one?

Unknown Speaker  31:39
Wait? I missed. I missed. Typed you I put in 3812 35 Oh,

Unknown Speaker  31:46
okay. Brad Gano, yeah, that's looking better. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  32:05
Because you imported it like that.

Unknown Speaker  32:10
No explanation why it was a 50 month 58 month contract instead of a you

Unknown Speaker  32:29
actually this would be all contracts.

Unknown Speaker  32:47
We should do, what in the world?

Unknown Speaker  32:51
What in the world is going on

Unknown Speaker  32:56
contract, cash price, percentage, um,

Unknown Speaker  33:04
and then this should be

Unknown Speaker  33:48
there we go.

Unknown Speaker  33:52
Yeah. Total number of payments, 58 for whatever reason, they did a 58 month contract. They literally signed a 58 month contract. What multiplier are they using? Well, they entered it as a 58 month contract. I don't know what the story is, because I

Unknown Speaker  34:09
let me okay, what's the story? Let's, here's my original documents. I

Unknown Speaker  34:36
Wow. This was when when RTO contracts were, hey, it was supposed to be a 60 month contract. I don't know why the engine is 58

Unknown Speaker  34:48
Hang on a second. Let's let's do mathy, where's my cash price? 3323

Unknown Speaker  35:09
30,

Unknown Speaker  35:13
huh,

Unknown Speaker  35:20
I don't even know what math they used to get to that number.

Unknown Speaker  35:27
It was, it was

Unknown Speaker  35:32
sloppy math, and they, I guess they just figured they're just going to figure out how to enter it in. It was all handwritten contract. I

Unknown Speaker  35:45
it's a closed out account, so let's just figure out how to handle it as a 60 month contract.

Unknown Speaker  35:52
Can you change it on your end to 60

Unknown Speaker  35:56
month or not? It's long done and gone.

Unknown Speaker  36:03
Did they actually pay as if it were 60 months?

Unknown Speaker  36:07
Well, okay, here's the funny part about it. Is that

Unknown Speaker  36:13
if you take if you take 3323 and divide it by 25 two,

Unknown Speaker  36:19
wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Let's try something

Unknown Speaker  36:24
else. There's got to be a way to math this around.

Unknown Speaker  36:32
So if I take 120, 3.07

Unknown Speaker  36:38
Wait a minute,

Unknown Speaker  36:40
3323

Unknown Speaker  36:42
divided by 27.2

Unknown Speaker  36:45
Well, that's close. It's not even that. We'd have to come up with some custom percentage for it, or custom divisor for it, because they put in a monthly rate of 120 307, then they added so this is the funny part.

Unknown Speaker  36:58
If you take 3323 and divide it by 25.2 you come out with a monthly payment of 130 1.86

Unknown Speaker  37:06
Well, however, they got to their numbers, they went the total with tax is 130 1.68

Unknown Speaker  37:13
so somebody got dyslexic and didn't understand how to calculate a contract.

Unknown Speaker  37:20
And so fun. What

Unknown Speaker  37:26
are you showing as a monthly payment for it?

Unknown Speaker  37:31
But I can't calculate one because I don't have a percentage,

Unknown Speaker  37:38
and we can't just stomp this. Can we

Unknown Speaker  37:41
Oh, because you don't have a percentage,

Unknown Speaker  37:45
right?

Unknown Speaker  37:53
Oh, goodness,

Unknown Speaker  37:58
how would we do this? How would we do this?

Unknown Speaker  38:25
See what

Unknown Speaker  38:28
any term like this, not zero.

Unknown Speaker  38:36
And we could

Unknown Speaker  38:45
hang on.

Unknown Speaker  38:58
Let's clean some of these up.

Unknown Speaker  39:07
60 month Why does Why does more space not have a 60 month contract? More

Unknown Speaker  39:17
space doesn't have a six month contract

Unknown Speaker  39:21
in

Unknown Speaker  39:22
Missouri?

Unknown Speaker  39:29
Do we have a Missouri probably because I

Unknown Speaker  39:40
just copied some stuff over just to get us up and running. And running. Let's make one

Unknown Speaker  39:50
configure contract definitions for more space to say mosuri needs a 60 month.

Unknown Speaker  40:00
On Track. Oh no, I gotta go over here, dude, what do you have a six month contract for Missouri?

Unknown Speaker  40:07
Maybe we need to just update

Unknown Speaker  40:09
it for what

Unknown Speaker  40:15
contract? How do I recalculate the i

Unknown Speaker  40:39
right? So, okay, we need to re import it.

Unknown Speaker  40:41
I'm going to try to backwards math, This thing I'm

Unknown Speaker  41:56
Wait a Minute.

Unknown Speaker  41:58
It's not.

Unknown Speaker  43:33
120 3071 23.07

Unknown Speaker  43:47
contract. Let's see if grock can backwards this form. Here we go.

Unknown Speaker  43:51
Let's do this.

Unknown Speaker  43:57
There we go. Some of these do exist. You're the ones that don't.

Unknown Speaker  44:01
Okay. Do either

Unknown Speaker  44:04
essentially exactly 27

Unknown Speaker  44:08
calculate you

Unknown Speaker  44:33
well,

Unknown Speaker  44:35
okay, so let's see if that works.

Unknown Speaker  44:39
Good old plug. It looks like 3323

Unknown Speaker  44:47
divided by 27 gives me a 123 07 All right, so I just need to, I need to add a which, which company did you need this custom? 58, one for

Unknown Speaker  44:58
Well, I.

Unknown Speaker  45:00
Good Valley,

Unknown Speaker  45:01
cricket Valley, okay,

Unknown Speaker  45:04
and what state?

Unknown Speaker  45:07
Um,

Unknown Speaker  45:09
I got two in Indiana.

Unknown Speaker  45:12
Indiana. I'm also going to need it consistent, though,

Unknown Speaker  45:17
that's what I don't know.

Unknown Speaker  45:19
Well, Give me. Give me the give me the math.

Unknown Speaker  45:24
I

Unknown Speaker  45:26
don't have payments on here is the problem.

Unknown Speaker  45:32
Well, okay, how about this? Give me. Give me the customer

Unknown Speaker  45:38
contract, 34963496,

Unknown Speaker  45:42
I'm alrighty, hey, here we go.

Unknown Speaker  45:46
And 58 month, okay,

Unknown Speaker  45:50
2167

Unknown Speaker  45:53
divided by 27 gives me 8026. Yep. Okay, so they're using it's they're being consistent with it. Alright? So let's do, let's go.

Unknown Speaker  46:03
I need

Unknown Speaker  46:06
configure our rental companies cricket Valley,

Unknown Speaker  46:10
and we need to add a 58

Unknown Speaker  46:16
save

Unknown Speaker  46:19
what must have one or one, only one, default book depreciation setting.

Unknown Speaker  46:26
What?

Unknown Speaker  46:29
Okay, fine. I'll check the default box. How about that? You happy now rental term length is not divisible by 12. Ignore and save

Unknown Speaker  46:38
you happy. Now

Unknown Speaker  46:42
you're all right, you said Indiana

Unknown Speaker  46:49
view, okay,

Unknown Speaker  46:55
we want a 58

Unknown Speaker  46:58
and we want a What does it say? We

Unknown Speaker  47:02
want a cash price percentage of 4656

Unknown Speaker  47:10
46.56

Unknown Speaker  47:12
which should give us 5344 and a 27 Okay, now you have unrentable building message. Oh, seriously. How about

Unknown Speaker  47:21
we just put the question marks in? Haha.

Unknown Speaker  47:25
Okay, now you have a 58 let's see what happens. What's the next one you need me to figure out? 59 for cricket Valley in Indiana? Well, actually, let's do the other 58 we have another 58 in Michigan. Order. Alright, let's double check the math on it. What's the contract number, 35263526,

Unknown Speaker  47:53
calculation. Or is there a way? Is there a way to link the keyboard, the calculator button on a keyboard to the calculator. Yeah, in a Mac How do you do it? Oh, you got to use some sort of, you got to use some sort of fancy schmancy, something or other to do it. Don't

Unknown Speaker  48:11
you need the calculator

Unknown Speaker  48:14
button? Where do you have a calculator button on my keyboard?

Unknown Speaker  48:20
154, okay, that one's correct. Okay, so and what state does that one for? Michigan?

Unknown Speaker  48:31
Michigan, Michigan, Michigan, Michigan. Earl Michael Finnegan, 58 and

Unknown Speaker  48:39
what was my cash price, 40 656,

Unknown Speaker  48:44
46.560

Unknown Speaker  48:49
yes. Unrentable building message, fine, fine, fine. Question, question, okay, fine, there you go.

Unknown Speaker  48:57
Okay, Michigan is done. Okay, just, let's do an easy one more space in Indiana needs a 36 month one, sorry, one more time. More space needs one in Indiana for 36 months a they don't have any. They

Unknown Speaker  49:14
don't have an Indiana one. Okay, so we should be able to go over here to the Indiana

Unknown Speaker  49:21
and copy it out for cricket Valley.

Unknown Speaker  49:26
Copy, copy this contract definition. We want to make it more space Indiana, RTOS, click, Save. These contract terms are missing from the rental company, oh, yes indeed, they would be

Unknown Speaker  49:43
more space. Okay, fine. You need a 58 now.

Unknown Speaker  49:51
Save must have one, okay, Seth, your validation is getting

Unknown Speaker  49:58
obnoxious.

Unknown Speaker  50:01
Okay, now more space has an Indiana, okay. Now need to figure out 50 nines.

Unknown Speaker  50:08
Well, yeah, 50 nines. Here's another good one, big one. Let's just knock out another big 140, twos in Michigan for cricket Valley,

Unknown Speaker  50:18
40 twos and for cricket Valley and 50 nines.

Unknown Speaker  50:25
Okay, give me the map. Give me a 40 which one we doing? 59 to 42 which one you pick?

Unknown Speaker  50:32
Give me the 50. Give me a 59 contract. 3479 in cricket Valley. I

Unknown Speaker  50:48
Is there a math by which he's coming up with this percentage?

Unknown Speaker  50:53
What percentage, the

Unknown Speaker  50:55
percentage based on number of months? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  50:59
can we just figure out what that math is. Well, that's why what I'm using plug for, I'm cross referencing what they're putting in, just to make sure that it actually maths out. But if you want to, you mean the math to get to a divisor to a cash price percentage.

Unknown Speaker  51:17
Oh, good question. I don't know that's what I was for. Okay, so,

Unknown Speaker  51:57
oh, you got to be kidding me. How is that even possible? We're going to do another 2727

Unknown Speaker  52:02
divisor. But, Oh, fun. Oh, you got to be kidding me, this is just so much fun. Cricket Valley. Cricket Valley, we're now doing

Unknown Speaker  52:13
a 59

Unknown Speaker  52:16
and what's my, what's my 4577

Unknown Speaker  52:22
and that needs to be in Indiana and Michigan.

Unknown Speaker  52:36
That's so funny.

Unknown Speaker  52:50
Agree to,

Unknown Speaker  52:55
well, okay, so what is the math? And I guess you would say,

Unknown Speaker  53:01
if you're shooting for a 27 divided by 59

Unknown Speaker  53:08
Yeah, 45.76

Unknown Speaker  53:09
that's how, that's how you're getting to that. But how did we know? How did we How did we figure out that it's 27 it's like, Okay, fine. I'm just going to keep using Groc or Claude for this, because it's, easier now that I have it not I told it how to work. You said you want a Michigan,

Unknown Speaker  53:27
Michigan and Indiana, yeah, on that one,

Unknown Speaker  53:31
okay, I have Indiana done.

Unknown Speaker  53:33
Did I not save?

Unknown Speaker  53:37
Yeah, 4576 okay. 4577

Unknown Speaker  53:42
okay. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  53:45
and now we want to do a

Unknown Speaker  53:49
Michigan you said,

Unknown Speaker  53:52
yeah,

Unknown Speaker  53:55
59

Unknown Speaker  53:57
45.76

Unknown Speaker  54:02
Wait, why? Why?

Unknown Speaker  54:05
No, it's 45.77

Unknown Speaker  54:18
still. Advisor, 27 Okay, Michigan and Indiana are now done, and now we need to figure out the

Unknown Speaker  54:26
42 correct. Give me a 42 contract. 5348

Unknown Speaker  54:33
sorry, one more time. 5348

Unknown Speaker  55:32
I'm about to make your life.

Unknown Speaker  55:35
Oh, goodness, easy this one. Okay, what?

Unknown Speaker  55:44
I have it right here,

Unknown Speaker  55:46
cash price percentages,

Unknown Speaker  55:52
ranges. So what do you what do you have for the what do you have for the 4242

Unknown Speaker  55:57
I have 55 to 66 depending on which contract.

Unknown Speaker  56:02
55, to 60. Oh, what do you mean? We need to listen. Ditch this, okay, on the import. Okay, let's just stomp in the cash price percentage based on what is on the contract, which is just, I mean, it's, it's just cash price percentage is literally cash price divided by contract amount, right?

Unknown Speaker  56:29
I don't know.

Unknown Speaker  56:32
Contract amount divided by cash price. What do you mean? Here's the cash price of the contract. Here's contract. It really is.

Unknown Speaker  56:41
It really is.

Unknown Speaker  56:43
I mean, why do it the hard, hard way when you can do it the easy way? Or why do the easy when you do the way, hard way? Rather than trying to bake all of these, these into the contract definition, can you just stomp them on the contracts? That's the plan. That's the plan. Stand them on the contract. Why was I working so hard? Because I just love to watch you work. It's vengeance for you watching me work yesterday. Okay, that's

Unknown Speaker  57:08
fine. I will get retribution.

Unknown Speaker  57:13
So basically, you can, if we can stomp then that means we can do all these custom ones just, oh yeah, we can do wonky stuff. We don't care what, like I'm gonna agree,

Unknown Speaker  57:25
divided by times 100 Okay, so then this guy delete that information. Yeah, you can go, you can go delete that stuff out contract.

Unknown Speaker  57:34
FYI, this is better, because we are just going to stomp, stomp in cash price percentage from

Unknown Speaker  57:46
RTO pro

Unknown Speaker  57:49
contract cash price percentage. All right,

Unknown Speaker  57:54
let's see what you hate about me.

Unknown Speaker  58:02
Wait. Let's go find one of these here. Let's go. 0555

Unknown Speaker  58:08
was one of

Unknown Speaker  58:11
them. 0555

Unknown Speaker  58:19
Wait. Was that one that says

Unknown Speaker  58:23
someone else?

Unknown Speaker  58:25
Steve, haha, duplicate header, oh,

Unknown Speaker  58:28
oh.

Unknown Speaker  58:38
Actually, undo. I

Unknown Speaker  58:47
wait a minute.

Unknown Speaker  59:05
What are you coming up with then,

Unknown Speaker  59:08
Steve, Steve, Steve,

Unknown Speaker  59:12
60%

Unknown Speaker  59:16
we have to pay off this.

Unknown Speaker  59:20
I am so confused.

Unknown Speaker  59:23
Okay,

Unknown Speaker  59:26
not invoices. We want

Unknown Speaker  59:29
primary.

Unknown Speaker  59:37
We are coming up with the cash price, percent. Okay, why is it not? Maybe it's getting cleared.

Unknown Speaker  59:54
Steve.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:04
A 60%

Unknown Speaker  1:00:06
so we need to change the

Unknown Speaker  1:00:10
contract

Unknown Speaker  1:00:17
after the state that's the issue.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:22
No. A sales tax.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:36
Wait a minute.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:41
I have, we have a problem. Houston,

Unknown Speaker  1:00:46
what is the problem? The payoff, percentage,

Unknown Speaker  1:00:53
payoff, discount, okay, does not equal i

Unknown Speaker  1:01:09
It is an equal reality. Oh, my, but I'm assuming cash price divided by contract amount is what you would want, right?

Unknown Speaker  1:01:19
Or do you trust this? We're using the payoff percentage, payoff discount, yeah, let's use that.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:27
This one, yeah. But then, but then we get, then we get wonky. Now, like we can't just respect both of them. I guess we can't really respect both of them. You got to pick one day.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:40
Man, how does this disconnected numbers? How does this happen?

Unknown Speaker  1:01:46
Like, seriously, it's called, it's called, we somebody figured out one side of the equation that just stomped in the payoff percentage on the other. Because both of those are stomps are, are figure outable numbers to input.

Unknown Speaker  1:02:01
Okay, so because RTO, RTO Pro has, has like there, it does not force you to respect any of these numbers.

Unknown Speaker  1:02:11
Got it, you literally can override the thing.

Unknown Speaker  1:02:16
So on a 17 month,

Unknown Speaker  1:02:18
did they just override the contract amount.

Unknown Speaker  1:02:23
Then, okay, yep, I mean, but then we have to respect the contract of cash price versus contract amount,

Unknown Speaker  1:02:32
right? Say it again. We have to respect,

Unknown Speaker  1:02:37
well, okay, if we can, if, if we can respect the payoff about and we can stomp in the per month payment.

Unknown Speaker  1:02:49
Well, depends on how you're how we calculate some things, but

Unknown Speaker  1:02:54
because the per month payment and the contract balance and the payoff discount are what's really going to like, those are the numbers we have to be able to line up on.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:08
Okay, I'm I'm very confused, though, because if your contract,

Unknown Speaker  1:03:18
this is a classic case of when your software can do anything. You can do anything, and you should not be allowed to do anything.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:39
We gave him a

Unknown Speaker  1:03:45
it I am so so confused,

Unknown Speaker  1:03:56
because the actual cash percentage is 56% not 60%

Unknown Speaker  1:04:02
Mm, yeah, but if we, if we inflate the contract value,

Unknown Speaker  1:04:11
wait

Unknown Speaker  1:04:14
the payment. The payment is 128, 55

Unknown Speaker  1:04:17
Yeah, and the cash amount,

Unknown Speaker  1:04:21
12, 4226

Unknown Speaker  1:04:24
Hold on a second. I mean, we can use that 56% number. I just

Unknown Speaker  1:04:30
don't know, what happens if we run into an EPO on one of these things? Well, you're going to run into an EPO on these things, but, but, I mean, do we care? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:04:43
if we, if we, if the EPO if, if the if, if, if.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:49
Well, I mean, it just means that

Unknown Speaker  1:04:53
the amounts won't tie out. You

Unknown Speaker  1:04:57
can still EPO it for whatever dollar value they say, the EPO.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:00
Put it for

Unknown Speaker  1:05:08
that's fair. But then the question becomes, what happens in accounting when you EPO out an amount that wasn't the EPO? Well,

Unknown Speaker  1:05:16
we haven't really thought through how to import EPOS. I

Unknown Speaker  1:05:20
Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:05:26
that's a fun thing.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:35
How many hair razors like this Do we have?

Unknown Speaker  1:05:41
Where the contract where

Unknown Speaker  1:05:45
the percentages don't respect each other or don't don't align,

Unknown Speaker  1:05:53
not you. I don't need you anymore.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:59
Okay? So this is, like, we're gonna have a whole bunch of these, aren't we? Yeah, we are. It's not, it's, it's, it is. Well, I think it's a lot, but I could be wrong. Okay, so this is the, this is the times 100

Unknown Speaker  1:06:19
we have low cash price percentage, what? And we got low cash price percentage two,

Unknown Speaker  1:06:27
and this guy is this, and then we're

Unknown Speaker  1:06:30
going

Unknown Speaker  1:06:31
to do where, and look, look,

Unknown Speaker  1:06:42
Hang on. Let's round these guys,

Unknown Speaker  1:06:47
round

Unknown Speaker  1:06:50
two decimals.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:56
Round

Unknown Speaker  1:07:03
there. How do you like now?

Unknown Speaker  1:07:11
I mean only about everything.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:14
That's because the contract value for EPO balances is based on what was actually paid, not based on tell me this is right. I

Unknown Speaker  1:07:44
so maybe we continue using this discount percentage.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:55
Would that make sense to you?

Unknown Speaker  1:07:58
Wait, how are you coming up with cash? The first cash price percentage. It's the contract value divided by contract amount.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:07
But are we sure he's not stomping in something on here? Like, this isn't the full contract value.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:13
Like, if you do, well, let's go take a look. Though. Let's do my

Unknown Speaker  1:08:18
calculators going in the wrong place this times 36

Unknown Speaker  1:08:23
6881 No, like the payment is set at

Unknown Speaker  1:08:27
this percentage, 71%

Unknown Speaker  1:08:39
36 times 191 equals 680 Yeah, but, but what? What's the second one that you're doing? What's the second number you're bringing? That's his thing that he puts down here, the

Unknown Speaker  1:08:50
discount. Oh, you're doing it by 100 Okay, got you so you're getting the other Okay, got it.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:55
Flipping it to cash price, percentage. Ah.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:00
Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:07
Well, that's fun. I don't know what to say to that.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:12
So let's, let's take, how is that even possible? Click on that. That any that the one, the one was the team one, sure. Let's look at this. Okay, what was the cash price of the building? 2776

Unknown Speaker  1:09:28
All right, where's calculator? 26 you the rental price is less than the cash price. What the cash price? The rental

Unknown Speaker  1:09:38
price is 2403 the cash price is 2776

Unknown Speaker  1:09:42
this is probably six. This is probably a

Unknown Speaker  1:09:47
CRA,

Unknown Speaker  1:09:50
how, how, how? CRA, you can't on a CRA, you can't have

Unknown Speaker  1:09:58
he can you.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:00
Yeah, contract amount would be 6676

Unknown Speaker  1:10:03
was, was contract payment. Wait, where does he? Where does he? Where does he do the amount paid paid down, or where does that amount usually fielded?

Unknown Speaker  1:10:13
That's a good point. That's where it is. That's the difference.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:19
Paid down, paid down 1340 if we take the paid down out

Unknown Speaker  1:10:26
of the off the cash price.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:33
Sum this,

Unknown Speaker  1:10:37
minus this,

Unknown Speaker  1:10:44
but now we're at 50%

Unknown Speaker  1:10:47
this guy was 14031,

Unknown Speaker  1:10:54
go find this same guy and find out

Unknown Speaker  1:11:00
he's not in here anymore, so that took care of him.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:07
Okay? Well, let's, let's look at some of these, all these, like 50s to 60s. One, let's look at one of these, sure.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:16
All right, make sure there's no paid down

Unknown Speaker  1:11:21
extra rent paid down.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:24
Okay, so scroll back. Zeros. What's my what's my cash price? Cash price is 1895, 76,

Unknown Speaker  1:11:35
and divided. What's the my divisor?

Unknown Speaker  1:11:40
What's my term? Three six months? 21.6 we should have a payment of 8776

Unknown Speaker  1:11:47
or 77

Unknown Speaker  1:11:49
but that's not what it is. Wait, what?

Unknown Speaker  1:11:53
105 32

Unknown Speaker  1:11:57
what it's the monthly rent is at 5050,

Unknown Speaker  1:12:01
not 6040,

Unknown Speaker  1:12:03
oh, my goodness, they put in. Oh, my You got to be kidding me. Wait a minute. Give me. Give me the contract number on this thing, 1031,

Unknown Speaker  1:12:13
like we have got oodles of these.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:19
Okay, so let's look at this. We have a payoff discount of 40. We have 36 we have 1895, 76 with a payment amount of 105, 32 well, how in the world did you come up with that?

Unknown Speaker  1:12:31
Okay, okay, let's go out here to document imaging.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:38
Oh, great. No documents.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:43
We have no idea.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:50
Wait a minute, this is really old.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:56
Oh, maybe this isn't.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:01
Let me. Let me exclude my

Unknown Speaker  1:13:06
the Oh, what is it? Intentionally excluded thing

Unknown Speaker  1:13:10
off of these wonky ones, let's, let's refine for that. Let's, let's see

Unknown Speaker  1:13:17
payments.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:31
Contracts and not

Unknown Speaker  1:13:41
and

Unknown Speaker  1:13:47
Okay, we have about 2000

Unknown Speaker  1:13:51
No, you have 644

Unknown Speaker  1:13:53
now we have 644 okay, but

Unknown Speaker  1:13:56
Okay, now let's, let's, let's give Give me. Give me one. I want to do. I want to do something abs, this, minus this, what's, what's, ABS, absolute value.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:09
I

Unknown Speaker  1:14:10
want to find the greatest difference. And

Unknown Speaker  1:14:13
I want to sort by that descending,

Unknown Speaker  1:14:18
all right,

Unknown Speaker  1:14:19
11, 1134,

Unknown Speaker  1:14:22
no. That's the wrong one.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:25
Contract. 0423,

Unknown Speaker  1:14:31
okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:14:34
whoa. What in the world? This thing doesn't even have a contract.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:39
He has nothing. What's the name? I

Unknown Speaker  1:14:43
don't have it a name. Account Number is 45, of four. Wait,

Unknown Speaker  1:14:48
Ronald, dude, he doesn't even have anything.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:54
It's here more space. We have a contract,

Unknown Speaker  1:14:58
423, maybe. But, I mean, it.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:00
It. It was,

Unknown Speaker  1:15:02
wait, what is going on here? This is loaded with contract, Whoa, easy shed rentals. What in the freaking world is going on here? What company?

Unknown Speaker  1:15:15
More space?

Unknown Speaker  1:15:19
More space? No, it's cricket Valley.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:24
No, it's more space,

Unknown Speaker  1:15:29
okay, former store four, huh? Store four?

Unknown Speaker  1:15:35
Well, that's not I'm confused because I'm showing a store two.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:41
I mean, hold on a sec.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:45
Give me. Give me. What did I input? What did I 04230423,

Unknown Speaker  1:15:54
I don't even know why it pulls this up. We don't even have a 0423,

Unknown Speaker  1:16:02
okay. Oh, wait a minute. What's this? Okay, I'm confused now, 00423,

Unknown Speaker  1:16:08
okay, okay, here we go. Here we go.

Unknown Speaker  1:16:11
History, okay.

Unknown Speaker  1:16:19
Paid out early.

Unknown Speaker  1:16:24
Total number of payments is six.

Unknown Speaker  1:16:27
This thing was brought in from another company, and we just literally imported it and made it work.

Unknown Speaker  1:16:43
Is what happened. I don't

Unknown Speaker  1:16:47
even know how you're going to account for this.

Unknown Speaker  1:16:53
Okay, let's try one of these, though. These are fun.

Unknown Speaker  1:16:58
4206, actually, let's even just go to an open 134366,

Unknown Speaker  1:17:16
okay, whoa.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:19
What on earth they're giving it a payoff discount of point six zero. They just input this thing wrong. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:17:27
hold on a second. Let me look at the documentation. Document imaging,

Unknown Speaker  1:17:33
what is this

Unknown Speaker  1:17:37
art you agree below, I mean, but keep in mind, it might be wrong, but there's 30 of them like this,

Unknown Speaker  1:17:43
Yeah, hold on.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:51
Some of them open contracts.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:53
Oh, my this is integrity rentals.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:56
Okay, let's see here.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:02
You don't work nice. 68, oh 4.25

Unknown Speaker  1:18:06
divided by 21.6,

Unknown Speaker  1:18:09
should be three, 1501, yeah, they just literally put the wrong discount percentage in it.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:17
Okay, let's look at this and

Unknown Speaker  1:18:45
so if what are you showing it should be, it should be a point four zero right.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:50
Payments are calculated off 60% well off 60% cash price.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:56
The discount says 40% cash price,

Unknown Speaker  1:19:01
36 month term. I

Unknown Speaker  1:19:05
don't even know how that could be. Hold

Unknown Speaker  1:19:08
on me. It looks like somebody, somebody switched the

Unknown Speaker  1:19:12
because if you do, okay, hear me out. 68 oh 4.25

Unknown Speaker  1:19:18
is the cash prize the building. Divide that by 21.6 gives me a three 1501 three 1501 is what the payment amount is. Three 1501 three 15.01 times 36 gives me a contract value of 11,340

Unknown Speaker  1:19:33
point 36 all of that matches up. They just done screwed up the payoff discount in here. And instead of putting point four zero, they put point six zero.

Unknown Speaker  1:19:42
And if they, if somebody would have wanted to, they could have turned around and bought the building at a 20% discount.

Unknown Speaker  1:19:50
No,

Unknown Speaker  1:19:52
okay, stop it. Edit point, yeah, they could have they pay off discount 60%

Unknown Speaker  1:19:58
yes. Sorry, yes, you're.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:00
100% right.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:08
Do we have any others? Okay, go, go. Show me the Do we have any others with a payoff discount of 60%

Unknown Speaker  1:20:15
Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:19
These guys, okay, give me the next one. Let me look at the next 140,

Unknown Speaker  1:20:24
Which one were we on? What number did I tell you? Oh, goodness, I don't know. Okay, there's 42 of sorry, I went to the first open 144, 41 I'm

Unknown Speaker  1:20:36
leaving it with open contracts, because those are the most worrisome. I

Unknown Speaker  1:21:06
again, I have question. Okay, we are currently in the middle of the migration stuff with the and we're coming up with quite a number of contracts where it literally looks like they just put in the wrong payoff discount. Is that possible? Like,

Unknown Speaker  1:21:27
instead of putting a point four zero payoff discount, they put a point six zero,

Unknown Speaker  1:21:34
manually entered.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:36
So what that means is we have a whole bunch of people that have a whole bunch of contracts out there that have a payoff discount of like, they're potentially going to pay off their building for way less money than they should well, it should be changed so you should identify whatever it is, and it should be changed because it's according to the contract. And obviously, if somebody catches it, we probably, from a good conscious standpoint, or are going to have to say you do have a document like that, as long as the paperwork always says this document is only good until the date of your next payment. So that is our the disclaimer that covers those kinds of things.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:16
But if you had somebody this month that so, so if they are open currently and I'm changing them, shouldn't be, shouldn't I have a

Unknown Speaker  1:22:27
make a list so that everybody in the office knows who was changed, in case they end up in in challenging conversations.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:35
Alright, can you Matthias? Can you give me a list of of contract numbers? Yes, it is 100% possible. OMG,

Unknown Speaker  1:22:45
whatever

Unknown Speaker  1:22:48
to you know, solve for

Unknown Speaker  1:22:52
data entry issues.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:55
Well, like you literally can't even do this on our system.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:59
That I like to hear that.

Unknown Speaker  1:23:02
I mean, you literally pick, you pick the term length, and just auto calculates for you. Okay, here's the how it should be. Well, yeah, but, but, I mean, you know, we don't get to create we didn't get to create it before. So one more. Matthias, you missed one.

Unknown Speaker  1:23:17
Oh, I'm sorry, thank you.

Unknown Speaker  1:23:22
Okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:23:25
okay, but those are just this, the 4060s but there's Yeah, we hope the open 4060s

Unknown Speaker  1:23:31
Okay, all right, thank you, Annie, okay.

Unknown Speaker  1:23:35
We also have a open do we want to look at the ones where the second cash price is less than the first

Unknown Speaker  1:23:46
group, or does that not matter?

Unknown Speaker  1:23:50
Okay, what I would really like to have? Okay, let's go. We figured out the 60 ones right, the 6041 incorrect ones.

Unknown Speaker  1:23:59
Let's look at, let's look at some of these other ones and see. Because what I'm going to, what I would like you to do then, is, I literally want you just to give me

Unknown Speaker  1:24:07
a report of these, of only open ones that we just need to go fix, all of these that need to go get fixed. But let's, let's verify one of these other ones. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:24:18
like an open? Should I go ahead and just limit these open? Yes,

Unknown Speaker  1:24:37
okay, we're down to 500

Unknown Speaker  1:24:40
Oh, you got to be kidding me. Okay, so let's go down here to this 1659216592,

Unknown Speaker  1:24:48
I'm looking at the art. I'm looking at the first number 16592,

Unknown Speaker  1:24:54
that come on down further. It's a 7060, yeah, there you go.

Unknown Speaker  1:25:00
These guys, yeah. What's the contract number on it? Okay, this guy's a 5084

Unknown Speaker  1:25:08
5084

Unknown Speaker  1:25:15
okay, I'm showing, yeah, 24 month contract with the wrong with the wrong payoff, discount. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  1:25:24
That should actually Okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:25:28
okay, give me another one. Let's go to 76 year, another one.

Unknown Speaker  1:25:34
Huh? Seven also 7060 or another one? No, the 7061 is pretty easy to see. The Yeah. We see one of those 4830

Unknown Speaker  1:25:49
whoops,

Unknown Speaker  1:25:53
Contract Number, 4830

Unknown Speaker  1:25:56
Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:25:58
Where

Unknown Speaker  1:26:01
you

Unknown Speaker  1:26:02
Where are you?

Unknown Speaker  1:26:05
Yeah, 48 4830, right?

Unknown Speaker  1:26:11
I'm sorry, yeah, 4830, I don't know what I did. It hiccuped. I Okay, here we go.

Unknown Speaker  1:26:17
Inquiry, are we show a 46% discount on a 60 month contract, which I don't

Unknown Speaker  1:26:26
even know if that's correct. Is that correct?

Unknown Speaker  1:26:31
60 month contract should be a

Unknown Speaker  1:26:34
40 58% discount, right?

Unknown Speaker  1:26:39
Yeah, 58% discount,

Unknown Speaker  1:26:44
but we're which is what we see down here. These are 58 but we have a bunch up here.

Unknown Speaker  1:26:55
Okay, well, okay, I think we are seeing the problem. We got 500 of these, right?

Unknown Speaker  1:27:03
Yeah, okay. Can you make that a custom report so that I can have zad it,

Unknown Speaker  1:27:11
and I get to go have uncomfortable conversations with people that we have 500 contracts across time, that have InCorp improper payoff discount percentages, and we need them fixed so that we can finish imports,

Unknown Speaker  1:27:28
which, I mean, that stalls us for today, doesn't

Unknown Speaker  1:27:31
it? No we can keep working on payments.

Unknown Speaker  1:27:35
Or we could just say, well, we're at nine. We're at 90 minutes. Do you want

Unknown Speaker  1:27:42
to try and do another one later this afternoon?

Unknown Speaker  1:27:45
I don't know if I can. I've got,

Unknown Speaker  1:27:49
maybe

Unknown Speaker  1:27:51
I'm happy to, well, you're, you're, you've got until three. Yeah, I

Unknown Speaker  1:27:57
can talk to your brother at three.

Unknown Speaker  1:28:00
I let me see how far I can get on some of this other stuff that I need to roll out. I'm

Unknown Speaker  1:28:08
I might be able to,

Unknown Speaker  1:28:11
well, let's do this. That's fine if you're gonna, if you've got, if you've got, if, yeah, if you've got other things that you can continue to work on this stuff.

Unknown Speaker  1:28:20
I'm going to go have a nice, long conversation, short conversation, not long conversation, and

Unknown Speaker  1:28:28
start sorting some of this out. Okay, I'm going to, I can put something tentative on on here. I can't promise that I can make it, but I'm happy to put a tentative thing on there, and then that sounds good. I'll try to, I'll see

Unknown Speaker  1:28:39
what I can get by then. Alright, sounds good. Thanks, sir,

Unknown Speaker  1:28:43
goodbye.
