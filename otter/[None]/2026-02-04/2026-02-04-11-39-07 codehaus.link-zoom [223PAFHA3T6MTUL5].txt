Speaker 1  02:27
Perfect. Howdy. Howdy. Hello, well, guess what find when you start changing softwares and trying to dig through data and you find out that, oh, internal tools are wrong, been applying wrong EPO discounts, even the ones that we entered today were wrong. So guess what? This is this. I'm really excited, because most, most contracts are now generated by software somewhere, and they're generated correctly. It, which means that the contract entry point is what's incorrect. Which means that if we are auto calculating, if we say our building is $10,000 and we're doing a 36 month contract, it's going to be this. And if your contract doesn't align with it, well then we have to figure that out. But guess what? It's not going to be incorrect. The EPO and the cash price percentage are going to be right. I am so tickled. It's like,

Matthias Miller  07:11
were you around when Seth was talking about his grandpa and their RTO? No, they had him over for lunch, and they were talking about this project, and it's asking all kinds of questions, do you handle this? What about this? What about the other thing? The one nuance that we don't handle is, for them, if you pay ahead, it goes straight towards the cash price. So you can basically EPO over time.

Speaker 1  07:46
There is that feature. There is something like that in in but it's not, it doesn't exactly go straight towards it's a it's a feature in RTO Pro that anything over the payment goes directly to the cash price. Um, I would argue the legality of it.

Matthias Miller  08:07
I wondered about that, about contract,

Speaker 1  08:11
but it is like, okay, it's the way that. The easiest way to do that is simply to pipe anything over a regular payment off into the into the security deposit. If the state allows you to increase security deposits,

Matthias Miller  08:29
see, it is Kansas, and I suspect that's one of the lower legislative states. But I could be wrong

Speaker 1  08:36
now the other, the other thing that we could do that, or see this? This is where. This is where I want to play with nuances for states like Indiana, and I want to say, Oh no, we don't. We don't. We're not putting the additional money in security. Pause, no, you're okay. I think Indiana's wording is you're not allowed to hold any additional money aside from a certain amount, so you would have to direct apply it to the cash price in order to meet inside of Indiana's legislative whatever. But, I mean, it's something we may, we may have to, we may have to come up with. But I mean, it's, it's simply as if someone said to me, I'd be like, Well, does your state allow increase security pause, yeah, okay, fine. Just pipe everything off into the additional security deposit, right? And use it a ton of payoff, yep. Now all we would have to do is have a setting for automatic piping,

Matthias Miller  09:35
right, instead of future rent. I mean, it's basically overpayments. What do you do with it? Technically, we'll probably want three options. One, cash price of the building. Two, future rent. Three, security deposit. Well. Whoa, that's fun.

Speaker 1  10:05
So his, this was his grandpa, you said, Yeah. And so his grandpa was fascinated. So he was he was chucking all kinds of things that and Seth's got to talk about all the things that we're working on, yeah. And the only nuance he came up with that we haven't handled is that one, yeah, wow, I'd say we're doing all right.

Matthias Miller  10:30
Phillip said, I never in my life would have signed up to become the rent to own expert. But I don't know what percentage of the, you know, top percentage of the industry this puts me on in terms of RTO understanding, but

Unknown Speaker  10:43
the top point, 000001,

Matthias Miller  10:47
it's really that, that severe, that strong.

Speaker 1  10:51
Do you think anybody else can explain in depth the things that we now know?

Matthias Miller  10:57
Probably not. Hey, was, was Claude right on your on your calculator?

Speaker 1  11:04
No, you can't. Okay, okay, technically, yes, technically, the only way you can, so far I can figure out, is the only way to get to the calculator is you have to go actually enter a contract, which is so stupid.

Matthias Miller  11:16
Is that the point of sale screen, or is that something completely different?

Speaker 1  11:20
Well, point of sale screen is where you actually go to load rental contracts. Okay, so yes, technically, it's right, but it was, it was TbU, true, but useless.

Matthias Miller  11:42
Okay, we have here.

Speaker 1  11:55
View this guy. We should tell Nick that his girlfriend looks a lot older than him.

Matthias Miller  12:02
That was random.

Unknown Speaker  12:04
Here. Have you seen a picture of it?

Matthias Miller  12:07
It's been a minute.

Speaker 1  12:09
Hang on. Where is this? Come on, stop it. What's going on? Here we go. I just, I just happened to see that his really his signal profile has has an image of him and his girlfriend, oh, and so then I was being nosy, and I was looking at his image. She looks older than he does.

Matthias Miller  12:40
Yeah, see that? Yeah, I haven't. He's not. He's He's brought around to Kansas, but never when I've been around. So, all right, actually did, did he? Maybe he did. I can't remember. That's terrible. Oh, what's it beat? Is he 21 so he's something like that? I don't know. I think

Speaker 1  13:01
I want to say that both Seth and Nick are about exactly the same age as my boys. What is B?

Matthias Miller  13:11
Yeah, I don't know. Club only agreement. It's loaded from a point of sale menu option nine, it's agreement with no inventory attached, just a club membership fee. It's open ended, doesn't get paid out and stays active until manually closed.

Speaker 1  13:24
Hold on a second. So give me the give me the contract number. Let's go look at this.

Matthias Miller  13:29
11574, the relevant Doc is RTO Pro, manual, loaded club.

Speaker 1  13:38
Agreement, glocklin, history, okay, let me just let me. Let me. Load this one more time. What Was it? Again, 311574,

Unknown Speaker  13:55
inquiry, history, inquiry

Unknown Speaker  14:23
Huh, what was

Matthias Miller  14:36
the dollar value? 368, 53 Yeah.

Speaker 1  14:44
It's all around deposit being spent, paid and spent. Here I send you a screens shot,

Matthias Miller  14:56
but that's but typically deposit lives outside of. Where did you send it?

Unknown Speaker  15:04
I haven't yet. No, there you go.

Matthias Miller  15:09
Signal, okay, so this is 9325932,

Speaker 1  15:19
yeah, it's all. It's that. It's that spending the deposit and paying it back in. Maybe it's paying it out or paying, I don't know, it's

Matthias Miller  15:31
paid and spent.

Matthias Miller  15:46
Uh. But how do we know it's deposit related?

Speaker 1  15:59
I'm making that good. I'm making an assumption that is deposit. Well, it says deposit,

Matthias Miller  16:07
right, but how do we like what on here indicates that?

Speaker 1  16:21
So what's interesting, they paid $100 pause into the $100 into the deposit at the beginning of the contract, and then they paid another 122, 19, which I'm presuming makes the that makes the 222 19. And then what were they doing? They were they closed the contract for 368 53 so I think they were, looks like they were trying to pay off the contract, pay out the contract with 368 53 from I don't know. I'm confused. Let's see if there's any notes. Customer paid off. I accidentally processed the transaction regularly, so I reversed it in history, put the difference in the deposit, then closed it out. There you go. They originally processed it as a payment, so they put the amount back the 368 back into the deposit, and paid out epod. It, I guess, um,

Matthias Miller  17:46
okay, well, then maybe the question is, how do we transaction reversed or backed out?

Matthias Miller  18:12
Oh, this is ugly. I

Matthias Miller  18:23
but this is payment related. We should be excluded, excluding all beats, shouldn't we? Well, except as the invoice. Does it void the invoice? So

Speaker 1  18:44
okay, well, I don't know what the B indicator is, but interestingly enough, on 510 she originally ran 146 34, and so reverse that back to the Visa card, I presume.

Speaker 1  19:13
But what I don't understand is then paid 122 19 into the deposit. But where does it come from?

Unknown Speaker  19:29
I mean, that's enough. Yeah, I don't know. Man, I don't this.

Speaker 1  19:40
Okay, the wait a minute. Paid it. I wonder the 121, well, what's the difference there? What's

Speaker 1  19:56
calculator? Calculator? 146, point, 34 minus 122, 19, $24.15 what is it? $24.15

Speaker 1  20:19
Why would she only put 122 19 into the deposit when she had ran 146 34

Matthias Miller  20:42
she accidentally treated it as a rental subtotal and added dwf and tax.

Speaker 1  20:50
There is no dwf, there's tax, $8.61

Speaker 1  21:04
okay, this is what's really, really weird. Okay, on 510 I have a visa transaction approval code 153248, that was reversed, and then it's used up in the 368, 53, payout. Closure. But then there's another 122, 19, paid directly in a deposit with approval code. 153439, and 122, 19, plus, I guess 222, that, Oh, that's the, that's where we get the, okay, so 100 $100 plus, that is how we get, this is how you get the the 222, 19 that was then spent on the deposit.

Matthias Miller  21:54
146, 34 I mean, that's the difference between lines one and two, which what the difference between lines one and two, 368, 53 minus 222, 19 equals 146, 34 Okay, so she is took a payment,

Unknown Speaker  22:21
reversed it, put the difference of the difference of the

Matthias Miller  22:35
ran another charge for 122, 19,

Speaker 1  22:38
to put it into the EPO amount. So, so, so basically, they could get a security deposit, plus the 146 34 to come up with 368, 53

Unknown Speaker  22:48
that's what happened. That's some craftiness. I will tell you that.

Matthias Miller  22:56
Yeah, you're not wrong. How in the world? Okay, here is part of the issue. Am I correct that refunds effectively reverse the invoice? Okay?

Unknown Speaker  23:23
In this case, yes,

Matthias Miller  23:27
Are there cases where it doesn't well?

Speaker 1  23:29
I mean, I don't know. I'd have to go, we'd have to go dig through all of that to we'd have to prove that out. But effectively, we had an invoice that was due on five, 124, line nine that was reversed, which reversed it back to, well, it took the next due date up to six one, once it was paid, once we reversed The invoice, it went back to five, 124, so essentially, I don't know if it reverses like,

Matthias Miller  24:08
What do you mean? Three to six? Do nothing right?

Speaker 1  24:13
Three through six, let's see 345, and six.

Matthias Miller  24:22
That's just some kind of weird dancing on an airplane wing. Click the wrong button something,

Unknown Speaker  24:28
yeah, those that should wash right? Okay.

Matthias Miller  24:33
What I'm wondering is, if we have a receipt with the B prefixed, can we nuke it? Ignore it?

Speaker 1  24:58
Well, how about this? Go find. More with a B prefix, and let's look at them.

Matthias Miller  25:04
So B prefix, let's do this well. I mean, here's one.

Unknown Speaker  25:14
Give me a contract, number 4182,

Unknown Speaker  25:22
Kevin Duncan. Kevin Duncan,

Speaker 1  25:27
okay, that is a refund. He's got several refunds, full amount.

Matthias Miller  25:36
Could we not? Okay?

Speaker 1  25:37
Hold on a second. Hold on a second for every, for every b prefix, it looks like, and I have to prove this couple more times. Give me another one. There is, there is a corresponding p prefix, correct.

Matthias Miller  25:50
And the question is, are they always the same amount they appear to be? Which means, if this is the case, if we encounter a C or a P record with the B equivalent and the values match, we could just nuke it

Unknown Speaker  26:09
and just disregard it. Yep, we lose some we lose some history.

Matthias Miller  26:19
Okay, so then, if we wanted to, but we're reversing the invoice. So would you want to how? Well, first, let's start with this. How important is the history?

Speaker 1  26:36
Well, I mean, history is important because that is what happened, like it tells the story of

Matthias Miller  26:41
what happened, what happened.

Speaker 1  26:59
Or can we? Can we, if we is there? Okay, riddle me this, what if? What if we did exactly what you said? We nuke it, but for what if we stuck like could? Could? Could we come back around and say, let's just stick for all contracts. Let's stick a copy. Well, first off, do we have a Do we have a link of all history? Like, could we, Okay, how about this? What if we build a report that said, you want to go see the entire history from this contract number, and we build a report that that looks at the RP source data and gives us that history.

Matthias Miller  27:43
Could we like, we're

Unknown Speaker  27:53
gonna we're gonna have, we're gonna have an accurate,

Matthias Miller  27:56
yeah, okay, so here's my argument against it. You really want to broadcast to the world that we're pulling in RTO PRO data. I thought that was something that we weren't going to massively publicize, but,

Speaker 1  28:19
I mean, we're but we're already linking out RP source data to accounts anyway, so you can go look at RP source data.

Matthias Miller  28:29
I would argue that you should have access, but general public shouldn't. But maybe that's we just hide those things again. That's that's, that's your call. If you don't think it's a big deal to

Speaker 1  28:45
well, if we went and built a report against it and we said, here's the like, we'd have to sanitize data some but, but who says? Who says we didn't just export it? Like, if we took this, who's, who's to say we didn't export the it to CSV files and push it in. Nobody can only, only if you become a client, then you know that how we did it. I mean, maybe that's, I don't know.

Matthias Miller  29:19
Okay, I have another idea. I

Matthias Miller  29:27
if? What if we allow forgiveness for rent, and on the date of refund, we just forgive the rent for that invoice. So okay, I

Speaker 1  29:53
mean forgiving it for that, but I mean that's not, we're not getting rid of the invoice. I mean, this the the monthly will do.

Matthias Miller  30:00
The invoice? Well, no, but I mean, if it'll reissue a new invoice when they actually make the payment for it, then

Speaker 1  30:14
I mean, and so wait a minute, why can't we handle this as a refund? In the refund RG, against that payment,

Matthias Miller  30:26
we can, but that's just refunding the payment. It's not canceling the invoice, but it's not canceling the invoice. Yes, I mean from RTO pro perspective, it is. Well, if you do a refund, it'll reissue a new line item for that month, it rolls back the due date.

Speaker 1  30:51
This is going to be one of those things where we're probably going to talk around in circles until I

Matthias Miller  30:58
just agree with you. Well, I can agree with you. No,

Speaker 1  31:01
no, that's the point. Is. The point being is okay?

Matthias Miller  31:08
Let me describe it like this. RTO Pro does not have the concept of invoices. It has the concept of payments, right? And every payment says, When is it due next? And so when you refund it, you're effectively saying, Well, the next due date rolled back to a month ago. Okay, so in my mind, if that, if that pair translates to an invoice, you're effectively canceling the invoice. Now we could theoretically

Speaker 1  31:37
Yes, this is, this is where I don't quite understand the why you say that? Because, in essence, you would be canceling the money against that invoice, but the invoice would still be due. I

Matthias Miller  32:04
Hmm, but there's no row that exists yet for the next due date until the point that you make another payment. Okay, here's something we could do. I mean,

Speaker 1  32:16
okay, I understand what you're saying, and if that makes more sense in your brain, to go about it that way, I understand what you're saying.

Matthias Miller  32:22
So but we could group, what if we would group invoices together by due date, and then you would sum all the totals together for the invoice.

Speaker 1  32:37
So in this case, the money would be paid against it, but we canceled the invoice, and so what if you're canceling it? This? What happens

Matthias Miller  32:46
to it? Well, then we take it back out, and then we put the money back in. Next time they make a payment, and

Matthias Miller  33:01
it's either that or we just create a $0 invoice.

Speaker 1  33:07
I don't like that. That sounds like troublesome.

Matthias Miller  33:13
You do you would lose the history of the initial invoice in the initial No, you would still have the payment. You'd have the payment against it, the cancelation against it and the new payment, if the amounts changed, For some reason, you lose the history of that and

Unknown Speaker  33:47
But what do

Matthias Miller  33:55
you think about grouping and merging? I

Matthias Miller  34:05
Oh, that's ugly. Hang on, we have here the original payment took due date from September to October, then we did a reversal and moved it from October to November. Which one are you looking at? What are you looking at? 4182, Kevin Duncan,

Speaker 1  34:23
wait, I'm in. Kevin Duncan, which one are we looking at now?

Matthias Miller  34:27
Um, what road? 2023, November of 2023. September. It's the, it's the the receipt, 71 ending in 71

Unknown Speaker  34:51
point in 1871 ending receipt, no. 00007174,

Matthias Miller  35:06
well, that's hard to see September and October of 22 Oh, okay,

Speaker 1  35:12
here we go. Okay, so the original payment went from 922, to 1022, and then it got reversed and went from 1022, to 1122, how's that possible? 22 how's

Matthias Miller  35:27
that possible? That's a good question. I'm glad you brought that up.

Speaker 1  35:34
So I guess we refunded and moved the due date forward. I um, huh.

Matthias Miller  35:46
Think we would need to change that we can look at all credit rows.

Unknown Speaker  35:59
Okay, let me go back and read notes. What was the date range on that

Matthias Miller  36:07
September of 2023, to September and October of 2023,

Unknown Speaker  36:14
when? When did the transaction? September?

Matthias Miller  36:17
Sorry. Oh, that's interesting. It happened in September 28 to 23 and then November 27 of 23 so something happened later, and they said, Ah, it's fine. We'll give you a free month.

Speaker 1  36:34
Okay, there's bankruptcy in here. That might be why email from attorney unexpired leases in Duncan's intention to assume the shed leaves. Okay, customer, Oh, I bet you, I will bet you money being refunded it. We took money after bankruptcy. We probably refunded it and moved it forward, kept him current. Is, I'll bet you what the what took place. That was February of 24 and no, this is 11, paid 1127, 20, that doesn't hold out.

Unknown Speaker  37:20
Okay, 1121,

Speaker 1  37:41
23 customer, called in and the payments overdrew his account. He will be sending me the bank statement, calling me next Wednesday. Okay, October, payment returned in November set and November set to run. 1122 left voicemail for the customer, interesting. So they refunded the payment, and November set to run so something to do with auto pay in there too.

Speaker 1  38:13
Crystal and Leanne were going through the records. The ACH for September never taken out. It was pending for a long time, since it was so long ago, Landis did not consider it an NSF. That's why account is technically past due. If he checks his records, he will be able to see that nothing was taken out in September when he calls, when he pays this month, we can defer, do a defer to bring the account current. So it sounds like some fun stuff in there.

Matthias Miller  39:13
Well,

Matthias Miller  39:27
hmm, okay, this moment still raises the question, okay, we could, we could have a row similar to forgiveness, that's like a, I don't know, historical correction type, and then we would just amend. We would have an invoice, we would issue a historical correction, and then we would. And that would and then it would take the invoice back to zero, but you could still go into the invoice and say, Oh, the original value is this much. It was corrected down to 00. And there was a payment, and there was a refund of that payment, and then you would issue a new invoice whenever the payment was actually used. So I'm just not sure if we're going to be effectively able to match. I mean, unless we literally look at receipts, which we could do and say one suffix, ID, no. But even then you have the approval code that gets reused, like I don't know that we can match based on due dates to say it's the same invoice. Can you do?

Speaker 1  41:03
You. But you know what I really want to say? Tell me,

Speaker 1  41:14
we are just going to straight up, ignore RTO pro history. We're going to go calculate everything that the customer has paid. And we're going to say, we're going to give, we're going to give you a report to the old RTO pro history, so that if you want to go sort it all out, have fun. We're going to just, we're going to calculate based on a whole bunch of fun math, exactly what the customer has paid across history. We're going to stop that as one time payment. And then we're going to say, what is your current your current due date? Great. Stomp that. Move on. Because here's the thing, if you think our history is going to be hard to untangle, you know that every other client that we're going to try to onboard is going to be like a nightmare to untangle. Is there a way we can just say we don't care? We're going to we're going to figure out exactly what the customer paid. We're going to stick that in there. We'll give you reports to the old history, so that you can go and, you know, wave your hands about it. All you so jolly well like and we just move on.

Matthias Miller  42:20
Well, I think we could even,

Speaker 1  42:24
well maybe, maybe it is that we maybe it is that we itemize in Okay, riddle me this, if we said we look across, we look across their history, and we say they paid this. It was this amount of rent, it was this amount of late fees, at this amount of tax, at this it's this it's all these things. Figure out how we want, how we want to itemize it and make it make sense according to the the start date and invoices that were incurred, and so on and so forth. But like you and I, are going to bang our heads against the wall till Kingdom Come trying to sort out all of these refunds and ins and sales rep or customer service rep mistakes. I don't know. Man, this

Matthias Miller  43:11
is Go ahead. How do we reconcile contract balance discrepancies? Or does that not matter?

Speaker 1  43:23
In theory, okay, just come out. In theory, contract balance is a product of, what are your monthly payments? What did you actually pay? If we get the monthly payments correctly correct, and if we get what they paid correct, the contract balance should come out.

Matthias Miller  43:44
Can we bring in historical payment information without getting ourselves into trouble, like could we look at all non refunded payments in

Matthias Miller  44:05
right, okay, could we from contract start date auto incur all fees up until the Current Date, or however far we need to and then could we apply payments? No, we don't. That's too complicated. You're thinking a single catch up invoice, right? Catch me up.

Speaker 1  44:35
Call it an import invoice. We're going to say, in theory, we're gonna, we're gonna look through your we're gonna figure out the history to the point where we can, we can agree that this is how much the customer has paid in money. Yeah, and once we've done that, then now, minus. Is any C transaction. C transactions are closing transactions. Sure if, if we're looking at closing it the closing transactions we probably should handle as their own, their own thing. But it's like everything that's been paid. We're going to say from start date until the day. Here's what you paid. Your contract started on this date. Here's here's one giant invoice chunk. Here's one giant payment, Ka chunk. What was your due date at that point? Great. Now what's your due date today? It's great. We're just gonna stomp it in. And if, if the Count's not closed, then we just, you know, we carry on from that point forward. I don't know. Maybe I'm just going way too simplistic about this, but I'm just afraid, no, we're gonna go round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and then guess what? The next time we do an import for another customer, it's gonna be like now we got to untangle their history, right?

Matthias Miller  45:59
Right? Um, okay, so let me think this through a little bit. You look at the latest history row. Well, does the contract record have the next due date

Speaker 1  46:19
each you mean, does the does the payment record have the next due date?

Matthias Miller  46:22
Yes, no. I meant the contract. But you go find the most recent payment, and you look at its next due date, exclude, with all the exclusions, the D's and the C exclusions, you do a sum of of all historical rows, which is the invoice amount, the sum of the security deposit and and all of those

Speaker 1  46:51
go about that route. You could literally leave the B the B prefixes in, because those are negative transactions, and they should just wash the positive transaction now

Matthias Miller  47:01
for the B's, Yes, correct. D's, no, due date changes.

Unknown Speaker  47:09
Oh, right. We have to ignore D's, Yes, yep.

Matthias Miller  47:14
And I can get you a list out of the blood found me a list of the types. And then, and so that's the catch up invoice, and the due date. Could we on the import? Could we base that invoice date reverse it off of next due date? In other words, we actually look at the next due date and go a month prior and we date the no hang on,

Matthias Miller  48:17
don't we? This gets a little tricky in math. Do due date should be based on the contract start date, and then we do a due date override to make sure that the next month's due date ends up in the right place.

Speaker 1  48:47
Now, the only thing I'm going to that we need to think about is that we need to build like that's the one time get your account in. But we do need to have a payment import that does work for anything from that point.

Matthias Miller  49:06
What do you mean? Well,

Speaker 1  49:08
you can't. We want to effectively run RTO Pro and only side by side for a week or so, or two or three, which means that payments still need to come in from RTO pro side.

Matthias Miller  49:19
Why would we just stomp out the old invoice and put in a new one.

Unknown Speaker  49:26
Okay, say that again.

Matthias Miller  49:28
Why wouldn't you just update that invoice?

Speaker 1  49:35
Oh, the import invoice. Yeah, we just keep stomping into that one until, until we're taking actual payments inside of our

Matthias Miller  49:43
software, right?

Speaker 1  49:45
And then as long as, as long as we have a history report that we can go look at the actual history coming out of RTO Pro, I think it's going to be like, it's going to be like, we could sanitize, we could make a report that sanitizes. That data, and, you know, maybe, maybe it is that we I don't, I don't know that, like, I'm not worried about it from an RTO pro side, because RTO Pro does, makes no indication that you that you have to let the database is locked and you can't, like, access your data. So theoretically, they we can't get in trouble with them. I just don't my my not wanting to broadcast to the world is I don't want everybody to know how we're necessarily doing this.

Matthias Miller  50:31
Well, you could what I would, I would still err on the side of caution. So what I would do is you can make it a proprietary report so they can't access report settings. Sure, and in hide activity history on, well, don't let them drill down into the detail screen, right? Simple, yeah. And if we want to, we could even make the detail screens empty. I mean,

Speaker 1  51:01
no, we just all the detail screens from the RP source data, like all of that stuff should not be like, you just can't get there,

Matthias Miller  51:09
right? We actually can't restrict it.

Speaker 1  51:12
There's a god level that that can get there, yeah. But you know anything, anything that people need to know from that needs to come out of some report.

Matthias Miller  51:22
Yep, Yep, I agree. I agree. I agree, I agree.

Speaker 1  51:34
And hey, Mr. RTO owner, if you need level access to that level, you have to sign a non disclosure agreement. Fair. There you go, sign a non disclosure, and we will, we will allow you to access to the RP source data.

Unknown Speaker  51:59
Is this viable?

Matthias Miller  52:03
This approach, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1  52:09
I mean, it's me being lazy because I don't

Matthias Miller  52:12
know it's smart,

Speaker 1  52:15
because I we, we the amount of the amount of content, like, okay, we're our companies are small. Imagine if you're importing a company that's currently at, you know, let's take a JMAG, for example, who's, who's 12,000 contracts, but their historical is probably 3040, 50,000 contracts.

Matthias Miller  52:34
Well, you look at the absolute crap data that's in here.

Speaker 1  52:37
Well, yeah, I mean, because nothing is nothing is standardized. It's like you can literally wave a hand and go figure out some jack wagon way to do it. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  52:56
all right. Well, that was fun.

Speaker 1  53:00
It's the most productive thing we did all week. Sometimes

Matthias Miller  53:05
great conversation with friends of ours talking about management training. And it's like, yeah, I took all kinds of management training. It was all dumb. Never worked. I always go to the guy who's sitting around on his phone and say, Hey, we got to do such, such, such. And thus, how would you, how would you do it? Go take his answer and go do it that way. And then go into a company and be like, Hey, who's the guy who's like, go to the shop manager, who's the Who's the guy who's always standing around, not doing anything, and go fire the manager. Go promote that guy. He's, obviously, he's, he knows how to do his stuff. He as long as he's on quota and he's standing around doing nothing,

Speaker 1  53:46
he's the part about being on quota was the part that I was missing. I was like standing around doing nothing, and put him in charge.

Matthias Miller  53:55
Yeah. Anyway, okay, so

Speaker 1  53:58
I know a company that did that and that didn't work out So very well.

Matthias Miller  54:04
Okay, fair invoices.

Matthias Miller  54:15
So here we want. Why wouldn't we run this? Yeah, okay, this is going to be a little sometimes there's just not enough caffeine in the world for job projects like this. But anyway,

Speaker 1  54:40
listen, this, like, remember, this is where, this is where. This is where. Is stalling. This, right here, all of this,

Matthias Miller  54:56
this is also what he told me to my face. You know it's like. I think this is the really good time to shut my trap. Okay, so, I mean, he, I mean he told me that he's like, this is exactly and in my head, I'm like, Dude, I know this. It's not, I mean, it is hard, but it's not that hard. Like, this is the solvable problem anyway. Okay, contracts, contracts.

Speaker 1  55:31
But there is a, there is a certain amount of insurmountableness that you feel from it.

Matthias Miller  55:35
Oh, it's just, I mean, but, I mean, but in legitimately so I mean, the reason people don't do it is because it's so incredibly painful. Yeah, it's far easier to tell people just sorry. And if there's nobody putting market pressure on you, that's what you do.

Speaker 1  55:52
Oh, totally. If there wasn't market pressure on this, I'd be like, Yeah, that's exactly what

Matthias Miller  56:01
it's like anyway,

Speaker 1  56:06
Wade, Wade, Wade, this, this might even be easier. Hold on a second. Tell me, hold on a second. Do we have anywhere in the RP source data that tells us contract balance,

Matthias Miller  56:33
paid amount, other paid amount, GRP, paid about security deposits. Dude, we

Unknown Speaker  56:43
have the security deposit information.

Matthias Miller  56:47
It's on here.

Speaker 1  56:48
Security deposit is not counted in amount paid. Okay, hold on a second. Give me a contract. Okay, what do you got there?

Matthias Miller  56:56
Well, I'm 0555, it's the weirdo. What are the weirdos?

Speaker 1  56:59
Hold on a second. Hold on a second contract. Info, nope, nope, nope, nope. When's our last update? When was our last update? Am I going to be looking at old data? Give me a contract?

Matthias Miller  57:12
0555, yeah, should be running nightly store, store four.

Speaker 1  57:18
Okay, well, that's a closed contract. I want an

Matthias Miller  57:25
open contract. Open, open, open, 3570, no, that's the asset. 4505, no, 0464, I'm sorry. 04640, that's a really new contract.

Unknown Speaker  57:39
Nope, that one's charged off. Oh,

Matthias Miller  57:51
complete active, well, go into your list that I sent you had

Speaker 1  57:57
that right here? Okay? Account contract number 3617,

Matthias Miller  58:05
let's go 30. We do have the security deposit amount, 617 and initial payment. Oh, goodness, let's not Oh, this is so stupid easy. This is ridiculous. Okay, so, 5547 let's start. Okay, I'm gonna break this apart. I need, like, a bigger screen. You

Unknown Speaker  58:35
did not just say that?

Unknown Speaker  58:37
Yes, I did. Okay, 5547

Speaker 1  58:40
let's open you up right here, and let's see what is, where is contracts, amount paid, 702. 36 Oh, my goodness. Okay, my date is a little old.

Matthias Miller  58:54
Okay, so the temp import ID is, let's just hard code it, yep. Import ID is a

Speaker 1  59:10
but my data might not be old. Hold on a second other paid GRP, paid no that still wouldn't get me to my 751, in so I'm showing contracts. Amount Paid is 702 36 and on here they're saying 751, 53 what would be the difference?

Matthias Miller  59:32
Security deposit or CRA are you looking at that? Hang on.

Speaker 1  59:35
Oh no. Rental pay. No. Sent. Rental pay. It is, right. It's, sorry, it's 702 30 Yes, dude, we literally already know what they paid. All right, let's calculate

Matthias Miller  59:50
it is the import ID persistent. Can I use it for RG matching? I.

Matthias Miller  1:00:04
Okay, so here's the import ID. I don't know where they need to import that the taxable subtotal. Oh, just when we

Unknown Speaker  1:00:16
hold on, we don't even need to add history.

Matthias Miller  1:00:20
What do you mean?

Speaker 1  1:00:21
Well, okay, every single time the night they run happens, we, we so the amount paid updates, yeah. How can we, how can we just say, like,

Matthias Miller  1:00:36
we would just pull in, pull in, what was paid. I mean, we'll just rerun the import every, every time we suck it in, we'll update this row based on what was paid. Way easier, okay, except for

Speaker 1  1:00:50
this, it is, I am okay. This is the point where I'm really glad he fielded everything, rather than than calculated. He just, he did make

Matthias Miller  1:00:59
our life a little bit easier. He did, admittedly,

Matthias Miller  1:01:10
okay, well, this is going to assume. How is this going to work for sales tax.

Speaker 1  1:01:42
But this thing's not updating nightly. What do you mean? It's not well. I'm just looking at this record the last the last modification history was January 30. Is it weekly?

Matthias Miller  1:01:58
Would be source data contracts. Let's go to, I mean, something ran this morning, 4am

Speaker 1  1:02:09
or, wait a minute, this might okay. There might not have been anything to update. That's why. That's why. That might be why. Duh, I should think, I should think beyond my nose hole.

Unknown Speaker  1:02:23
Well, it's, I know you can say it's a tall order.

Matthias Miller  1:02:31
That's not what I was thinking. That's fair. I'm just, I'm just glad that nose was the word used in there. Okay, we're gonna stomp in a fake,

Matthias Miller  1:02:52
non taxable subtotal. Okay, this is gonna get fun, but we'll get there non taxable subtotal, and then we have tax stuff.

Matthias Miller  1:03:18
Can we just file it all under?

Matthias Miller  1:03:33
How are we going to tie out tax liability? So

Unknown Speaker  1:03:43
Ooh, that's a good question.

Matthias Miller  1:04:00
Well, we don't need to decide that now, do

Speaker 1  1:04:14
we what's kind of a bummer a boy would be nice if he, if he would have, if he would have actually fielded contract or sales tax fielding on here, amount paid in sales tax, that would have been really nice.

Matthias Miller  1:04:25
Wouldn't have it? Well, we have the, oh, this is just the total payment.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:33
Yeah, I was hoping for another fancy just dump it.

Matthias Miller  1:04:36
Are you sure it'll be Oh, but your taxes isn't on there. Rate is, yeah, but that's not gonna

Matthias Miller  1:04:50
what would be the implication of us importing the payment as if it's non taxable because we don't want to pay, we don't want to report it for taxation purposes. You.

Speaker 1  1:05:05
Yeah, so actually, we don't need to worry about sales tax on Okay, cringe a little bit saying this out loud, but technically, what you really want to know when you are, okay? That that's not true. If you're if you're wanting to test books, that would be a problem, because tax really wouldn't calculate properly until the moment that you're actually transacting in here, if we don't, if we import it all as non taxable. Mm,

Matthias Miller  1:05:46
just means that at whatever point you switch over, you're going to have to file the manual way for the old stuff, the way that you've always done.

Speaker 1  1:05:53
Well, theoretically you would, you would pick the start of a month to switch so let's say, you know, February 1 would be when you would really want to start transacting payments in the software. Okay? Because then you would have an entire month like, like, that's when you would start like, you don't switch mid month. You always switch on a month. So that way you go from filing sales tax out of RTO Pro to filing sales tax in here.

Speaker 1  1:06:30
Here's the other option. Is that you run, you run some models that says, go calculate historical history, and then let's compare it against, let's compare rent against what's currently on the contract. If they align well, then you can, you would have your tax value to bring in

Matthias Miller  1:06:52
well, and as long as, I mean, theoretically, if we run that model across everything, we should be able to whatever, just use it everywhere. Yeah, I know that sounds weird, but that was a sentence that does not make a sense out of context, maybe not even in maybe not even in context. He says, okay, okay, so there's sales tax. So now we're going to start grabbing sales tax, which we still need for

Matthias Miller  1:07:31
Wait, but for reporting. Can we just import a county and city like we need The state,

Matthias Miller  1:07:50
but for reporting purposes, can we just

Matthias Miller  1:08:02
Sorry? Where's our contract? Through the contract start date?

Matthias Miller  1:08:40
This would be, I

Matthias Miller  1:08:46
thought we had a month.

Matthias Miller  1:09:11
So what we would do is we would do,

Matthias Miller  1:09:18
we need to calculate the contract doesn't have the next due date.

Speaker 1  1:09:21
Does it? Each payment does, but no, the con, I don't think the contract does, no, ah,

Matthias Miller  1:09:28
yeah, it does. Does it? It's three one, yes. Sorry, Bob. Okay, so then we want to calculate the the

Matthias Miller  1:09:52
it's the.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:00
Yes, sorry, Bob,

Speaker 1  1:10:40
I'm beginning to feel bad for having making have made fun of him for fielding all this stuff on the contract record

Matthias Miller  1:11:05
fair made his life easy, makes our life easy, makes our life easy. Okay, so this is the number of months. Okay, I'll be right back bathroom. Yep, yep.

Speaker 1  1:14:05
All right, I have seven minutes. I gotta talk to you. Try to talk to you with your brother. Okay, do. Hey.

Matthias Miller  1:15:15
Me, let's do this yet. I'm

Matthias Miller  1:15:49
well, okay, I mean,

Matthias Miller  1:16:03
but we actually want The prior due date.

Matthias Miller  1:16:14
So this is actually the

Matthias Miller  1:17:35
I don't know if it's completely right.

Matthias Miller  1:17:47
But we're doing a month. We're doing it based off the contract due date and

Matthias Miller  1:18:07
CPO is not right anyway, yeah, you got to go. Yeah, okay, later.
