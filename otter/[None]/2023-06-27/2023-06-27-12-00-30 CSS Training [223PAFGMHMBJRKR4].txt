Speaker 1  01:22
Hey this probably won't take super long as just a couple of things that I want to touch base on I think mostly with them business related stuff

Unknown Speaker  01:48
first item is this screenshot there you go

Unknown Speaker  02:10
this email that Jonathan had sent last week. Oh yeah, man replied and asked you to reply to the question and you weren't copied in?

Speaker 1  02:23
I don't know. Yeah, I figured we might as well just knock this one out. Now. They are listed. I talked to Nick yesterday and they are already like, roughly a third of the way through coding standards, so Well, yeah, they're chipping away at it. So yeah, regarding attachments and downloads, are we planning to use document archive or NWS gi setup for managing size and downloads?

Matthias Miller  02:55
Is this on the this is on the development resource right?

Unknown Speaker  03:00
I think so.

Matthias Miller  03:02
The also a potential downloads yes we are using if they're talking about

Unknown Speaker  03:08
how does Yeah, yes, this is s3

Unknown Speaker  03:28
I can reply

Unknown Speaker  03:39
sending this back

Unknown Speaker  03:52
hey you just put that email I

Matthias Miller  03:57
can reply by that quick too. So email last night and I was like, I need to

Unknown Speaker  04:01
go look it up that's fine

Unknown Speaker  04:15
right now let's do title is then the development resource record Yep.

Speaker 1  04:47
Cool, good. And then I don't know if I still need your input. that are not

Speaker 1  05:06
you know that there's at least one to do and mmm hear something thought out about talked about it Ellis yesterday as well I was wasn't sure if we still need your input at all Tim is thinking about doing a like welcome email and of length that is sent once they have the record created for the member has and so yeah we got these down here from LF yesterday wasn't sure if you had any else you wanted to add to it or not

Unknown Speaker  06:06
reserve setting baby settings

Unknown Speaker  06:28
the

Matthias Miller  06:29
as soon as the record seems is safe seems just a touch

Unknown Speaker  06:32
preemptive I mean right

Unknown Speaker  06:57
can't remember

Matthias Miller  06:57
what capabilities we have with the emails whether we can

Unknown Speaker  07:06
because if you

Unknown Speaker  07:34
here is one possibility when I think it's kind of a client question actually

Unknown Speaker  07:48
seems to me like

Matthias Miller  07:51
as his record is saved, It's fine as long as they're they're okay with the person

Unknown Speaker  07:55
immediately you know

Matthias Miller  08:01
what logging in as soon as those two are linked together, you know as soon as there's an active membership and the two are linked together.

Matthias Miller  08:37
Otherwise, it's a like

Matthias Miller  08:53
Oh, technically how you would probably do it is a some kind of hidden field that triggers that email being sent. And then you have an X an X 30. That runs daily that looks for new new folks who

Speaker 1  09:06
haven't been sent that and sends it and then you have a separate workflow that says basically send it right away.

Matthias Miller  09:22
But I think again, it's a question on their workflow. Do they want

Unknown Speaker  09:25
to do they want that? Welcome emails?

Matthias Miller  09:29
I mean, does it find a Senate just as soon as that that's created? If so, that is the simplest.

Unknown Speaker  09:35
Yeah. If not,

Matthias Miller  09:39
is it okay if it gets sent next day that's or you know, every X hours or next day or something

Speaker 1  09:44
like that. That is the subsequent next simplest third option is it's going to get sent automatically every X hours, but they can also manually fire it

Matthias Miller  10:12
Bottom Line the bias for simplification I would

Speaker 1  10:26
ask the client do they want to send it automatically or?

Matthias Miller  10:59
I would prefer to given three options one sent it automatically right away to send it automatically every X number of

Speaker 1  11:05
hours three require them to manually

Matthias Miller  11:08
send it and when you set up the system it's gonna be a little bit of a hassle getting all the onboarding email sent out but you only do it once so fine

Unknown Speaker  11:16
is what

Unknown Speaker  11:25
I would prefer to avoid the

Unknown Speaker  11:33
you can send it automatically and you can send it manually

Unknown Speaker  11:42
I think they can decide

Unknown Speaker  11:49
sounds good that then Then last and it said we can follow this follow up on this next week sometime

Speaker 1  12:13
but I figured while we've got it they pointed out that there is a little bit of an issue in the logic of this scheduling meetings and so yeah, just talking over if this is going to be an issue we think it'll be okay yeah, just kind of hearing your thoughts on it and a meeting scheduled.

Unknown Speaker  13:30
Yeah, just

Matthias Miller  13:31
change the logic not to create a subsequent meeting

Unknown Speaker  13:36
create a new friends background

Matthias Miller  13:37
process to create a new meeting meeting record with status equals tentative in the meeting date set one month for the current date if there are no future meetings

Unknown Speaker  13:59
we're Yeah, trying to like catch up with where you're at if there are no future meetings I think so. I think it's as simple as that.

Speaker 1  14:44
Are there are no meetings. Yeah. Scheduled after the scheduled date. I

Unknown Speaker  15:17
think scheduled

Unknown Speaker  15:24
seems to me

Matthias Miller  15:25
like scheduled next meeting should be visible if

Speaker 1  15:27
the next meeting is tentative or doesn't exist and

Matthias Miller  15:36
the view next meet and it could be a view next meeting

Unknown Speaker  15:41
if the next one is confirmed

Unknown Speaker  16:03
that sounds right

Speaker 1  16:26
we're gonna have to add your next meeting. Because here it's saying opens the future tentative meeting. There is one. So once it gets changed to a scheduled meeting

Speaker 1  16:50
are they ever going to use the previous meeting record to look at the upcoming meeting by the upcoming meeting? Oh, that's fair. I think

Unknown Speaker  17:15
that's fair.

Matthias Miller  17:16
I'd be fine with always having I think it seems reasonable to me to have it always be visible scheduled next meeting is visible if there's not a

Unknown Speaker  17:22
scheduled meeting. The meeting the after? I think it's fair.

Matthias Miller  17:28
No, just giving them what they asked for. I think that's reasonable. There's no reason to

Speaker 1  17:32
be next. Yeah. Yeah. So then I would just be visible until a follow up meeting is scheduled? Yes. Cool. Okay, um, I think unless there's no way to do and I'm sure year. This was I think about all that I had.

Unknown Speaker  18:00
Here, trying to get some of this stuff wrapped up here as as much as possible since they're making

Speaker 1  18:10
such progress on it. So yeah, I don't think I have anything else. There's great questions. Yeah. Sounds good. Cool. Yep. Thank you. clears up a lot. And I'll just do it for it's so good. Awesome. Sorry. All right. Talk to you in a couple hours then. Okay, sounds good. Thank you for inviting me.
