Unknown Speaker  04:42
Good morning. This is Martin.

Unknown Speaker  04:45
Hey, good morning Mark How are you doing this morning?

Speaker 1  04:54
Doing well two beautiful, beautiful morning and yeah How about you

Matthias Miller  05:03
saying you've had

Speaker 1  05:05
things starting to settle into a routine for your family?

Matthias Miller  05:10
Yes, starting to like I'm gonna be back at work full time this week. So

Speaker 1  05:21
is your little daughter is she? Does she sleep well? Or is she get fussy baby or worn?

Matthias Miller  05:31
And she's been very chill legs. I think it varies a little bit from night to night, but she's been going anywhere from three to five hours between feedings. So at night. Yeah. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  05:56
For your other Did you have any of your other children as as newborns or were most of them?

Matthias Miller  06:06
Yeah, we had three of them as newborns.

Unknown Speaker  06:10
So this is not really something that completely new. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  06:34
Are you one?

Unknown Speaker  06:35
Yep.

Speaker 2  06:42
I got on, like, two minutes ago, and I said something like a minute ago, but maybe you didn't hear

Matthias Miller  06:48
I missed it.

Unknown Speaker  06:51
That's just fine.

Matthias Miller  06:55
Having a few things heading into the office. We can get started here.

Matthias Miller  07:08
Beth, can you just maybe walk us through the proposal for the discretionary bonus? Sure. And Mark, maybe we can talk talk through that first. Sure.

Speaker 2  07:20
So what Matthias and I were thinking is that it feels like a decent bit of work to get the get the bonus. Okay, get the have separate payroll versus production bonuses, which is what we had talked about mark on was it Thursday or Friday, I forget. That feels like it's a lot of work. I'm fairly low on time. Plus, it's also a fair bit of added complexity. So we were wondering about instead just keeping the bonus as it is, which is just which currently that percent will just come from the payroll. And then if you want to give them more of a bonus, we can just give them a discretionary bonus for the week. That would be a simple way to implement it especially if you said it's a pretty small use case scenario.

Speaker 1  08:15
I mean, I think we have one or two employees currently using it and I did not prepare for I just saw your email about half an hour ago and did not prepare well for this but what I think what would be helpful that if you could could we take that file that I send to you Thursday Friday when we talked in what with the proposed that the way you're proposing that we handled and how that will change the numbers that would be one way that would help me to wrap my head around around this

Unknown Speaker  09:01
here's what you're saying is is we take whatever employee gets paid as a bonus take that out of that exact same amount out of the pool

Speaker 2  09:20
and then if you want those if you would want those values to be different mean where you would have a bonus percent is different from the pool bonus percent just add the had that extra amount in the discretionary bonuses RG

Unknown Speaker  09:43
Okay, so Well, okay, let's look at at Wayne first so I think what what I've been asking for that with is different than what you had what payroll module had what assisted calculate it was that we

Speaker 1  10:12
pay him $8 An hour and then a 50% bonus now if I remember correctly you were taking it appeared like an assist even though we were paying him 50 cents on the dollar for like half the bonus rate that everyone else is getting. See assist was calculating a full bonus rate for him which would take away take away from the other employees. Bonus rate is and then, great, I'm looking at the spreadsheet that I sent. They sent to you, I don't know if you have that open or not.

Speaker 2  11:07
Okay, are you talking about the not the payroll calculators or Geez, you sent me a payroll Calculator Spreadsheet?

Unknown Speaker  11:14
Yeah, that that one I'm I'm looking at Yeah.

Speaker 2  11:17
Okay. On Wednesday or something?

Speaker 1  11:22
I think so. It's called payroll calculator 2.3 Yeah. Bonus per hour down and so it's 38.3191

Unknown Speaker  11:35
Yes,

Speaker 1  11:36
correct. So I'm looking at at Sal Q Well are 11 So I think if I remember correctly that where I'm showing 19 hours in the pool you are showing 38 hours which you are showing all of the hours which increase the 286 by 19 hours and then made for a lesser bonus per hour is that

Unknown Speaker  12:20
or are you saying that if if he

Speaker 1  12:27
am 50% of the bonus then we'll also take 50% out of the pool or okay let's um we start on the left in the lab and he's paid $8 An hour and then he gets a 50% bonus rate so he works 38 hours so so age we're paying him $304 of base pay and then I 11 We're paying $728.06 Because 38 hours times bonus per hour eight times 50% is $728.06 And so we're going to pay him 1030 206

Unknown Speaker  13:25
how much

Speaker 1  13:27
how much of that of his total pay are we taking out of it exactly that or is it something different?

Unknown Speaker  13:42
I would think it'd be exactly that

Unknown Speaker  13:52
okay

Speaker 1  13:57
while wrapping up with different head head his total pay is $987.62

Unknown Speaker  14:08
What week is this for? And what date

Speaker 1  14:13
yeah it's seven nine to 755 system for shit time

Unknown Speaker  14:20
I was just looking through the

Unknown Speaker  14:23
breakdown to see what's going on

Unknown Speaker  14:34
Yeah, I

Unknown Speaker  14:36
pretty sure I see what the difference is it's you have are you looking at at the breakdowns in the live system?

Speaker 1  14:50
So the pool rate, bonus rate of 1799 is is calculated on a lower hourly bonus rate because we're Assist is dividing this is calculating more hours pulled in BAM on my spreadsheet and I'm dividing the pool by 286 hours and I think you're dividing it by the 100 summit if I remember correctly

Unknown Speaker  15:36
see

Unknown Speaker  16:07
just trying to look at some of the data

Unknown Speaker  16:30
I also have

Unknown Speaker  16:31
the verification reports

Unknown Speaker  16:41
okay

Speaker 2  16:44
I'm just trying to look at some underlying values here see for sure what's going on

Unknown Speaker  17:25
okay um,

Speaker 2  17:26
offhand. The first difference I'm saying is the bonus pool looks like it's different

Speaker 2  17:40
Okay, so in your stretches, D 2022.

Unknown Speaker  17:47
Is the base pay okay? The base pays.

Speaker 2  17:51
So that okay, your bonus The bonus pool in my breakdown report is about $200 More set I'm just trying to think through what else different

Speaker 1  18:13
on which report is that? Is that on the verse report?

Speaker 2  18:17
It okay this is a I have a breakdown payroll calculations just on the menu that's like shows like 50 columns and shows all sorts of this that's what I'm looking at. So there it says the bonus pool is 11 153 26

Unknown Speaker  18:36
which is

Unknown Speaker  18:37
Kimmich.

Unknown Speaker  18:40
base pay is

Unknown Speaker  20:08
Okay, so the

Speaker 2  20:11
the bonus pool okay the initial pool is also about 200 some dollars more than the pool that you're

Speaker 1  20:22
gonna let me see what why am I? Okay I thought we're showing the same numbers there you have Don't you have 13,009 69 as the subtotal and then you're adding 272 64 for labor intensive

Speaker 2  20:41
okay are you on the verification report?

Speaker 1  20:46
Yeah I'm on the first page of your of your verification report. You have the full percentage and then the pool sock total

Unknown Speaker  21:00
me try opening that

Speaker 2  21:04
I was just looking at some of the underlying macros and stuff was not returning what I was expecting.

Unknown Speaker  21:13
Maybe Oh, well change the date on that one would help. No, it's still 14 2420 Okay. That's not okay

Unknown Speaker  21:58
okay, so you had with the

Speaker 2  22:04
the okay with the onset builds you see how much that is? It might actually be I think it's actually going to be matching

Speaker 3  22:12
13 nines 696 to last six okay,

Speaker 2  22:26
it Okay, that is actually Max Yeah, so I'm confused why the bonus pool isn't matching up because that makes it seem like the pool base pay is not matching.

Speaker 1  22:37
It isn't your your pool base while what I'm calling pool base pay determine 23 meaning the the base hourly rate taking out taken out I think we're we must obviously we're we have different numbers there 183 Thank you for showing 1089 I couldn't find that number on the verification reports but just doing the math I think that

Unknown Speaker  23:10
yeah let me

Unknown Speaker  23:30
just here

Speaker 2  23:38
yeah mind saying 3089 for base pay

Unknown Speaker  23:45
so where

Speaker 2  23:48
I mean I don't know if we're just I don't know if we're displaying it anywhere that's I found the macro that calculates it so what it was doing is taking the pool hourly wage and the production hours and then adjusting by overtime if it needed to if there was more than 40 Production hours

Unknown Speaker  24:33
is that not what it

Speaker 1  24:35
we don't well we don't have most there's values that were entered incorrectly. We don't have. I'm not showing anybody with more than 40 Yeah.

Speaker 2  24:46
No, I was. Yeah, we don't have any either in Insight. But so where is it?

Speaker 1  24:55
So in column P I'm Showing that's why I'm totaling up my 3000 2283 we'd go through and look at ways line by line

Speaker 2  25:14
who is just Jay Miller just not have any hours? Okay. I was just saying that there's one row in the report the doors for Yeah. Okay. Let me

Unknown Speaker  25:29
get that paste

Speaker 1  25:33
showing $194 less than I am and that's what I'm

Speaker 3  25:55
so you have a full base pay of 585 for Myron, are my people in this report are in different orders. Oh, wait, why does

Speaker 2  26:13
well, why does Myron have Okay. In live? No, no, that's right. It's right. I was getting different. There's a Marian Annamaya. And I was looking at Mary and she doesn't have production. Nevermind. It's Myron 585.

Unknown Speaker  26:29
Nathan am

Unknown Speaker  26:35
is three ad. You've got 418. Right.

Unknown Speaker  26:45
11 I do. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 2  26:48
Oh, his full hourly rate is entered as $10 in in an assist.

Speaker 1  26:55
Okay, well, I wonder I see there. I think there's a few more that

Speaker 1  27:06
what do you have for Orla, we probably have the same thing or like Yoda. Yeah, we do. He's entered

Unknown Speaker  27:15
at $8.

Speaker 1  27:19
Okay, so when they entered the employee config they entered, they should have entered the same amount for it looks like an entry mistake on Yeah. And then what about Stephen am should also be allowed in dollars.

Unknown Speaker  27:35
He's at.

Speaker 2  27:37
He's entered. So Stephen Miller. Right. He's entered as $10 for a base production hourly rate and $0 for the pool hourly rate.

Speaker 2  27:50
Let me check. Okay, so that's on his timecard has pool hourly wages set to zero. Let me check his employee compensation. See what that's all? Yeah, he's got a pool hourly wages zero. Should be

Unknown Speaker  28:09
sorry, I

Unknown Speaker  28:10
didn't catch what you're saying you're cutting out.

Speaker 1  28:14
Okay, is that better? Yeah. Am I still breaking up? No, you're good now. So, Stephen, Stephen Miller should be $11 on both.

Unknown Speaker  28:24
Well, he's definitely not on

Speaker 1  28:27
fourth rate. Wonder things aren't adding up, son if if they entered those values? Yeah.

Speaker 2  28:35
I mean, I wonder if we would have the hourly rates. All right, if our numbers match up?

Speaker 1  28:42
Well, I'm wondering Yeah. Okay, so we've got him

Speaker 1  28:57
What what are you? Do you need to rerun this report? Or what do you need to do to be seen you see these changes?

Unknown Speaker  29:10
If I would,

Speaker 2  29:13
I could change the pool hourly wage just on their time cards and leave them well, okay, that's where I have to change it to update, get the report get this week working. Because what we do is we when we create the timecard we set it to the amount from the employee compensation then you can change change it on the timecard. So I need to change the timecard ones and we should also fix have someone fix the employee compensation settings at some point. Yeah, I can have it update immediately.

Speaker 1  29:47
Now are you saying if you if you change make these changes on the timecard it'll it'll update for this week but to make that valuable probably be best to have them update on the employee config settings. I mean, I'm sure you guys have learned this in software development, but we've learned that unless you want to go and change it,

Unknown Speaker  30:13
we've learned that is make those changes, and then it's usually best to whoever entered it in the first place to go in and fix it. So know how to fix it.

Speaker 2  30:29
Yeah, that sounds right. I'll fix the ones on this time on the time credits for this week, so that we can check if our numbers are matching up. Does that sound good?

Speaker 1  30:40
Yeah, yeah, let's do that. See what our numbers are. So Nathan,

Speaker 2  30:43
should have a pull out of the rate of 11. Yeah, so change that one.

Unknown Speaker  30:54
Can you change both?

Speaker 2  30:57
You can change. On the timecard, I can change just the full hourly rate.

Unknown Speaker  31:09
And not the base production.

Unknown Speaker  31:12
We looked at, but

Speaker 1  31:15
but some of those are incorrect as well, looking at okay. So maybe, maybe we maybe they are better off while maybe SS do we need do you need to just go and make those changes to the employee config files?

Unknown Speaker  31:33
I think maybe for production amounts.

Unknown Speaker  31:39
And that's fine. I mean, yeah.

Speaker 2  31:41
Okay. I'll just okay, we'll see. So Nathan, I fixed the timecard. Stephen had said he should be 11 and 11. He's currently

Unknown Speaker  31:59
Yeah, these employees should, should all be.

Unknown Speaker  32:02
He's currently at 10. Zero,

Unknown Speaker  32:06
which is quite far off.

Speaker 1  32:11
Yeah, the hourly should should be same for both for all these employees for bass production. And.

Speaker 2  32:17
Okay, I think this does answer my question of whether I'm subtracting who will pay correctly because it's showing that his pool pay is for Steven for that week was $0 So that part's working correctly, which is good. Okay, so I changed his hourly wage to 11. I'm going to go on his play record and change the base production hourly wage to 11 and the pool hourly wage to 11.

Unknown Speaker  32:50
Why was he at okay,

Speaker 2  32:54
we also have a nonproduction hourly wage right after the pool hourly wage and I wonder if you accidentally set the pool hourly wage to zero when they were trying to set that one? I don't know. It's one guess

Unknown Speaker  33:08
it might very well be

Speaker 2  33:11
okay, so I'm just gonna make notes of the ones that I change. Fixed Stephen W. Miller compensation settings because I don't want there to be too much confused. I mean, we do have modification history, but still I just want to make a list of them. Um, okay. So which other ones are we let me just do

Speaker 1  33:38
our lane Yoder should be 11 and 11.

Unknown Speaker  33:42
Okay, he's at

Speaker 2  33:44
1010 I'm just going to fix his time No, I have to fix his record to not just his timecard production

Unknown Speaker  34:04
lovin.

Speaker 2  34:33
Just gonna go down through you, Myron that. 1515. I haven't met 1515. Nathan is at a refresh my report.

Speaker 1  34:45
If it's easier says the rates I have on my the file that were that I had sent to you. Those hourly rates are the correct rates.

Speaker 2  34:59
Yeah, that's what I'm looking at that comparing it to the spreadsheet here. I mean, compare it to the values and assist. So it's just gonna go through so Myron, we have 1515 and that matches what we have in insist. Nathan is that 1111 And that now matches. Norman is that 10 and 10 I assume that's the Norman Lehmann we've got here 10 and 10 J is at Tennant and and same and assist Daniels at also 10 and 10 Same Okay, or Allah is that loving and be loving Yeah. Steven is love and love and check mine yes now that we fixed it while is that 10 and 10 Yep, we got that right the Wayne that eight and eight and save it here

Unknown Speaker  36:13
Keith is that tenant

Unknown Speaker  36:22
A and then Aryans does

Unknown Speaker  36:26
he's got to

Unknown Speaker  36:29
marry and is showing that should should be a nonproduction

Speaker 2  36:35
Yeah. Oh, he's got eight affordable hourly rate entered here. Yeah, he doesn't have to be fortify he doesn't have hours so it doesn't calculate wrong but it doesn't affect

Speaker 1  36:51
it now but it could be good yeah. Yeah, it should just be his hourly base production hourly wage and pool hourly wage should both be zero.

Unknown Speaker  37:02
Do you want me to fix that? Or should we have someone else fix that?

Speaker 1  37:09
Well you're fixing on this company you're fixing all the others right so that we can rerun this

Speaker 2  37:15
Sure. I had just fix Yeah. Okay. Let me

Unknown Speaker  37:21
go ahead on yeah then we're good.

Speaker 2  37:23
Yep. So Marian should be zero for both base prod and pool hourly wage fix that me fixes timecard two

Unknown Speaker  37:40
okay

Speaker 2  37:54
think I needed check there's one other guy that I need to fix the fixes employee compensation?

Speaker 2  38:54
Okay, Nathan's the only one that I hadn't updated his compensation settings.

Speaker 3  38:58
do that here. It should be at 11 00 Okay, okay. Now

Unknown Speaker  39:12
let me run this report

Unknown Speaker  39:24
Okay, let's see. So I read Iran had

Speaker 2  39:34
base pay of 585. That's the same here. Nathan had a previous vape for 18.

Unknown Speaker  39:42
That's the same.

Speaker 2  39:45
Daniel Okay, let me just check. The total doesn't match up though. So more off by exactly $300 The total slumming go through Daniels at 380. That's right.

Unknown Speaker  39:59
Or less four Wait That's right oh oh I see. Um

Speaker 2  40:15
Okay, so in your spreadsheet Norman It looks like he doesn't have does he not have any production hours

Unknown Speaker  40:25
or not

Speaker 1  40:32
so here's I think we need to may need to change how we think about this we say is in production but we don't want his ad to come out of school which is exactly 200 hours in that would be so I'm thinking there's probably two ways we could do this and I'm not sure we get the same result if we what happens if we go just try something real quick I think if we would change his pool wage or hourly wage to zero I think we would get same

Unknown Speaker  41:16
Yeah, we should

Unknown Speaker  41:20
okay we

Speaker 1  41:26
not quiet if I if I change that on my spreadsheet I'm still showing joining

Unknown Speaker  41:41
me for hours

Speaker 1  41:49
okay, if you change I think there's two ways we could do this to get the same bonus pool on either you make the hourly wage zero or into all of his hours is non production hours on

Unknown Speaker  42:15
which way do you prefer that I do it

Speaker 1  42:21
well okay by by entering those is non production hours then that means he can't get any

Speaker 2  42:38
I mean, okay, right now with how our calculations work you can't he's we can't specify a separate production bonus percent and a pool bonus percent so he can either get his bonus from the pool or not. Or we just have to give him a discretionary bonus. That's how it works right now.

Speaker 1  43:02
Okay, and if you say okay, could you set his Can you set his pool bonus ad

Speaker 1  43:14
I think what we should do is just completely eliminate because because that's kind of an edge case scenario. I think we should just take out his just enter zero hours for him and go down and figure out that lloween thing first and then come back to say what we want to do with with Norm and so

Speaker 2  43:30
so set him to have all his hours been on production

Unknown Speaker  43:38
Yeah, let's let's do that.

Unknown Speaker  43:57
Let's see what what do we want to know? You mean your $10.09 5926? Yeah. Okay, and you're dividing that by how many hours 286? Let me see, where would you see? Or

Speaker 1  44:24
what are you showing? What I'm showing in D? 25. And 26. What numbers are you showing there? Now 25 is the total pool hours that we're using to divide the pool and then may 6 is bonus per hour.

Speaker 2  44:46
I mean, my the hourly rate I have is 3832.

Unknown Speaker  44:55
Okay, then we're matching exactly.

Speaker 2  45:00
Let me I mean, it looks like pay is lloween is at 1030 208 and set your payroll has Oh, six sets of in two cents. For me, I

Speaker 1  45:16
don't think that I'm right. And that's that's close enough. I'm not. I think the rounding on my site is off. Okay, now that's okay. Then I was thinking about that wrong because, well, Wayne, how much of okay, and you're taking that full amount 1030 208 out of the pool.

Unknown Speaker  45:42
Let me just see.

Unknown Speaker  45:45
That is

Unknown Speaker  45:54
Yeah, I mean, should be.

Speaker 1  45:57
Yeah. And so, you're okay, so if we said his bonus percentage is 50%. And that takes that also takes 50% of his bonus out of the pool, obviously. Mm. The way it says thinks about it right now is, is column II where the bonus percentage that the employees paid in column Q. Bonus percent, the amount of bonus that comes out of the pool. Those are exactly the same direct and you can only set them at one place. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  46:35
Yeah. So then

Speaker 1  46:42
then I think we're like let's just double check a few of the other employees a reminder or yeah, see what what your total pay is now compared to what I'm showing on my screen so Myron

Speaker 2  46:51
Myron doesn't Yes His total pay 2079 48

Speaker 1  47:03
So we're down to just some rounding differences and I'm pretty sure that way I'm yeah, that's that's fine. That's I'd say that's all good now the question is how do we handle what's the best way to handle for Norman

Unknown Speaker  47:35
Okay, the thing that am I correct that the only way

Speaker 1  47:49
if we if we set a bonus percentage if we want him to get bonus if Is there any way for him to be paid an hourly bonus rate

Unknown Speaker  48:10
that doesn't cut yeah

Unknown Speaker  48:15
not right now

Unknown Speaker  48:16
that that reflects the pool okay

Speaker 1  48:23
so we have we have right we have a few options one would be have it come from the pool if we if we'd have it come from the pool we could let's try to see how much this Barry if we changed his pool or what do we call it his pool hourly wage to zero and had all of his hours as production hours then that would get us somewhat close

Unknown Speaker  49:12
yeah it'll that will mess up everyone else's

Unknown Speaker  49:17
bonus pay

Speaker 1  49:20
if we do that what what is your bonus rate per hour

Speaker 2  49:25
and this is on Norman changes give him back his hours so they're all

Unknown Speaker  49:36
production

Speaker 2  49:38
change the our pool hourly wage to zero and the production bonus should be at 80. Is that right?

Unknown Speaker  49:45
Yeah. Okay. Let's see.

Unknown Speaker  49:58
Okay, so Oh, he's

Speaker 2  50:02
his total pay is now 11 ad and 40 cents

Unknown Speaker  50:11
11 ad and 40 cents

Speaker 2  50:19
let me see what so his it set his base production hourly rate not pool to 10 bucks an hour pool bonus hourly rate is 2828. So that's a that's a combined hourly rate of 3828 for 30 hours, which gives me so 3828 for 30 hours is a lot of them 48 and 46 cents and then that is let's see, why is it different amount? Okay, today,

Speaker 1  51:02
that's what I have 1148 46. But earlier you said

Unknown Speaker  51:07
so that's the pay with?

Unknown Speaker  51:11
Okay, I'm just hit Tony?

Speaker 2  51:24
Oh, he's got a $32 discretionary bonus. Oh, the type is minus, but the amount is 32.

Speaker 1  51:39
Got it. So let's just to make things simple. Let's just take that out right now. Remove the

Unknown Speaker  51:45
timecard.

Speaker 1  51:48
Yeah. What are you testing? So? Okay. What are you showing now for him?

Speaker 2  51:55
I mean, it'll be the I can tell without removing, it'll be the 1148 40. Okay, so, because I can see the amount before that's added. I just gone to the total pay at the end, which included that.

Speaker 1  52:10
Okay, so that's one one way we could do that, which it now lowered. It now lowered. Everyone else pay? Because we're, we're taking that out of

Unknown Speaker  52:21
school. Yeah.

Speaker 1  52:29
And before that was all outside the hotel? I think that's I did not get the time to ask back with a business process or the use case for that. So am I. So the options we have in front of us is? Well, to answer your question right now, that is the only situation where we thought we would we may use this a lot. But as we speak, that is the only place where the only application among six companies where we're using that. So I think it's it's need to do our due diligence and see is that important. But add that would add harmonic complexity. Yeah, right.

Speaker 2  53:15
And just and I would have trouble fitting it in, given, I'm still working on the verification report stuff. Because I've got work for other clients as well, that had to be doing last week. So I was working on verification some but I'm still needing to wrap that up today. And that'll take most of my day today. And I'm leaving tomorrow, sometime time. So I'll be around for a day or two in like, a few days in like two weeks, but I'm very close to my availability

Unknown Speaker  53:57
so

Speaker 1  54:00
okay, I want yeah, what you're seeing what you're saying we could do it manually, like we could look at what is the pool bonus for the week and times, you know, somebody could just do that and enter that amount as a Yeah,

Speaker 2  54:17
that's one option. I mean that given the circumstances, I feel like that's about our best option, but you could also be either the other way of having it reduce everyone else's

Speaker 1  54:35
could you Okay, let's do Do you have a way of exporting those verification reports? Well, no, we're matching on the amounts and so nevermind, I have a matching amounts here showing so.

Speaker 1  54:57
So I would say okay, It really doesn't matter. to you which way we go do we? Do we do what we just?

Unknown Speaker  55:07
Yeah, it doesn't make

Speaker 1  55:10
the male the only way we're it would affect us if if we would say, if there'd be something that I'm missing a strong reason that keep the add that functionality. And at that point we would be looking to June 2024. And Matthias do it right?

Speaker 1  55:36
I'll ask, I'll do my due diligence and ask if they're important or not. And I'll let you know, just so you know, like, what, what we, what we're good. And does that answer your second question? An email for the hourly rate versus pool age, because I have a spreadsheet as an example. He's been different. I'm wanting to fix this one as well to have feeling on it.

Speaker 2  56:04
Do you have examples where the well, actually going through it? I'm pretty confident we're doing it fine. Because we had examples where some of these were not matching, and the amount being subtracted from the pool was, was what I'd expect. So I think we're good.

Speaker 1  56:22
Good, well, so I'll get answers. I'll dig into that. Decide which, which way we want to go with that? And FYI, I'll let you guys know. I do have a few other things real quick, if you have some time yet. If not. Yeah. So one thing that we fail to do is as we speak, we have not tested any salaried employees. So we have for this company, we have two owners that are drawing an owner wage, like a salary of 1500 per week. And I didn't know could you just I thought it might be easiest for you to just enter that information. And

Unknown Speaker  57:15
at least for one of them, and she'll go through those steps and then we can the people entering these that just enter it like, like a choice employee. So

Speaker 2  57:37
okay, do are these people in the system already or not?

Speaker 1  57:41
They are ya. So if you're fine with let's just walk through one of them. So I have one Calvin's label

Unknown Speaker  57:54
this is for shutdown.

Unknown Speaker  57:57
Yes. Calvin's like they're

Unknown Speaker  58:01
not user. I'm sure they're

Unknown Speaker  58:03
okay. He's not an employee.

Speaker 1  58:08
Okay, he would be listed as a what I meant by in the system, like he set up or he's receiving assist report. Okay, have a user profile. Okay, but not not Yeah, you're correct. Not as an employee.

Speaker 2  58:24
So, Calvin, we've got a you've got to Calvin's labels. There's a Calvin dodge label who's got an email, a compass to fax that email by fax.com.

Unknown Speaker  58:42
What know that, that sounds like old stuff that

Speaker 2  58:45
really should. Okay. And then there's also a Calvin, Schley, ba, who was created by Josh and okay, let me check the other one. This more the one that the first one that I read was created by doing in August of 21. Then we also have a Calvin's labor whose input content type is employee non production, which must be one that someone added in the system. Okay with is added a year ago or something? I don't know what that's about. But Matthias, do you know why you added an employee nonproduction contact type, like a year ago in June

Unknown Speaker  59:31
Oh by now

Unknown Speaker  59:39
because I'm not Yeah, I'm not sure why that's there.

Unknown Speaker  59:42
Well, maybe maybe it's okay. He had been asked for it.

Speaker 2  59:46
He doesn't have he's got very minimal information on this employee. It's just name and then a mark is a timecard user and have an hourly rate of 22.

Speaker 3  59:57
But okay, that was not An hourly rate is old okay?

Speaker 1  1:00:05
So he would not be a timecard we basically enter as an owner

Speaker 2  1:00:12
so should I use the weekly salary? Okay I'll use this second one I guess I don't think he's with us I'm fine to just change this one from an employee non production to employee second enter him as an owner or should I be worried about wise employee non production

Matthias Miller  1:00:42
let's take a look at the

Speaker 1  1:00:58
we could also see if if Daniels labor is that contact is cleaner and easy to work with. Do him instead of it is

Unknown Speaker  1:01:09
said Samuel

Unknown Speaker  1:01:12
yeah

Speaker 2  1:01:19
it looks like he's not system. So what are you saying?

Unknown Speaker  1:01:22
Okay, then let's

Unknown Speaker  1:01:28
I think Josh

Matthias Miller  1:01:32
had some time tracking hourly rate stuff. Oh, way back. And so I think that's probably why we changed them to the employee nonproduction type. Gotcha.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:46
So it should be fine. Just

Unknown Speaker  1:01:49
yeah. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:54
Then Georgia Kelvin.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:56
Yeah, yeah, let's do that.

Speaker 2  1:01:58
Okay. So what should I if effective date? Just the start of this year, does it not matter?

Speaker 1  1:02:08
Yeah, that's fine. One 120 Yeah. This year

Speaker 2  1:02:11
it's time for the company employee type of owner compensation type salaried you said what was his weekly salary

Unknown Speaker  1:02:23
1500

Speaker 2  1:02:25
Okay. No time tracking D again owner percent what should that be? Like if well from the so this is

Speaker 1  1:02:43
this is not the type where the owner gets you know 15% The employees are paid seven and then he gets the remaining eight or whatever this is just gets 1500 Every week okay, do you own a percentage at zero? Yeah I think so.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:04
Then goat then should do you want me to run verification report?

Speaker 1  1:03:13
Well yeah, if you don't mind just rerun that verification report for seven nine. The week we were looking at it just sent me them just sent that entire file two files and inside automation

Speaker 2  1:03:29
we have both a owner payroll and company payroll. So

Speaker 1  1:03:38
just send them both I mean, I know you're reworking the verification report currently so that they're stamped that will look different but this will Yeah, I like to just take a look at it and see if there's nothing that we're working or missing. I don't think there is but

Unknown Speaker  1:04:17
okay, see

Speaker 2  1:04:28
so we didn't I don't not sure that we really created them to to have owners that are just getting tired without the pool. So some of the like, they'll get paid fine in the I think but it's just like the verification report is showing was created expecting them to be getting some

Speaker 1  1:04:59
Okay, and Are you talking about the company verification report which would show her

Speaker 2  1:05:07
donor verification it's not going to show in the company the company payroll report is not going to show owner type contacts in like the payroll overview or stuff like that

Speaker 1  1:05:23
so that won't change whether you have when you add an owner you're saying it'll still be the same it won't yeah okay and that's that's fine. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:35
Let me just send you those files this is entered to incite

Speaker 1  1:05:41
automation yeah that files it inside automation else

Unknown Speaker  1:05:47
there we go

Speaker 2  1:05:59
option Bureau verification on payroll for seven

Unknown Speaker  1:06:09
I sent them

Speaker 1  1:06:13
I will get that file look at it and then there's a few other things that so Okay, first of all, is that all looks correct there's nothing special on setting up owner pay like that. I mean, they can basically just give them the details and they can just match what you entered for.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:36
Yeah, that should work fine. Then

Speaker 1  1:06:45
just an update on the revised verification reports are those I think okay, we had left it with last time we talked there were three projects or priorities that you were working on one was reworking the verification report Yeah. Finalizing the finalized payroll we're freezing the numbers I sent this to you or not let me just sent this to you real quick through this is my notes after we talked

Unknown Speaker  1:07:19
I did I think wow. Not sure

Unknown Speaker  1:07:40
let me know as soon as you get that

Unknown Speaker  1:07:55
okay it just came in

Speaker 2  1:08:13
so verification reports I hope to have done yet today I think finalize payroll we're currently freezing production already with that finalized payroll option

Speaker 2  1:08:35
we're and then the second point under finalized payroll we were just leaving for now. Right Okay,

Speaker 1  1:08:42
that's well that's what I said how we would want to pay rates in time for it to be frozen so the amount of information change and event changes made to historical pay however we will table is much more conscious of of this with Seth and with some people all in fun, however, we will table this for now if it does become an issue we will address it at that point. That's basically what we'd said Right? Yeah, yeah, I think so. And okay, so the finalize that if this function has mostly been completed I think you need to do yet so and then payroll calculations which we talked about that were nothing on on dad that I just wanted to make sure that we're Yeah, the one hopefully hope to be done today, too. Okay. If you if you hope to be done with that today is that that requires a Josh Update to update live

Speaker 1  1:10:02
So we would just communicate with Josh then on doing an update on that, because I think we're going to, well, here's, here's one thing that I want to wait until we have that those new verification reports to start taking it to the companies. And in Sure, okay, going live, but I expect after you're done today, you will have you will have actual examples of how they're going to look in the live system. If so, if you could send me some examples that would be would be helpful, because we could start reviewing with companies then, you know, even before

Speaker 2  1:10:49
I mean, if I'm not going to easily have examples of what, okay, if I enter data in my test system that matches the live system.

Speaker 1  1:10:58
So the best thing would be to just wait until Josh probably, yeah, understand. Okay, that that makes sense. Okay, so we talked about honor pay. And then two other questions I had.

Speaker 1  1:11:25
I didn't, but what is okay. So, for, in the case of affordable or ABC plant one and plan two, we have we have one or two individuals that occasionally work in both companies in the same week, only. The way we have been handling that was okay. So what it is is we have driver that is on nonproduction pay, but he anyone situation, he will help when we do like a build on site, which we go out and talk to building on site. And some days, he'll help one company some days he'll help the other company. And then the way they've been if he helps two days. But what we have been doing is, is somebody's just manually been looking at it and saying, Okay, well, he's helped, he helped this company for a days that we're going to subtract $250 out of their pool. So we're gonna pay him in straight hourly, that all just happens. But they got because he was helping this other company, they they got, they'll get ordinarily, high amount of pool pay unless we so they're just manually saying, let's take $250 out of pool for that week. And it all works. It works just fine. And I think leaving that Manulis is the right. I think you need that manual element to make that work. So two questions, one. You can't build

Speaker 1  1:13:27
you can't build. You can't have an employee listed in different companies in the same right. No. Okay, then the second question, I didn't think you could be extremely complex then. The second question is, if you what is the best way for us to do that? Like subtract $250, subtract $400 Whatever from the pool

Unknown Speaker  1:13:58
but what is the best way to do that? Innocent?

Unknown Speaker  1:14:04
Yeah, trying to think

Speaker 1  1:14:09
I understand you could do a like is it a pool override or a production override? I prefer not to do that because it's which would would be to say instead of $78,000 for the production, there's 85 production. Yeah. And I prefer not to do that because you'd have to do a lot of math to say well, okay, 75,007% So, I mean, you could do a labor intensive building and just then you know, a negative if the on on a

Speaker 1  1:14:57
you're breaking up on ER, Can you still hear me? Oh, yeah. 30 seconds.

Speaker 2  1:15:07
So what I was saying I mean, I just thought you could also use work orders, but I'd rather not. I'd rather not do that. I mean, you probably don't want to do that. So how it's reported a little differently.

Matthias Miller  1:15:19
You don't want to just have a column in the production override row that says, kind of, it's like a production Delta. Like, you can either override it based on a an adjustment versus straight up override. See, but

Speaker 2  1:15:40
what is right is the pool, not the duction.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:45
Oh, right. Right. Right. Right.

Speaker 1  1:15:47
Ideally, it would be something that could be could be tracked, like he come back later. And you say, Oh, I see why we did that. mean, like that the labor intensive

Speaker 1  1:16:03
work order could almost work because you well, would it? Would we create a would we create a mess if we work orders have to be tied to a skin? Right? Yeah, we couldn't be generic

Speaker 2  1:16:22
and even actually affect the ghoul? Exactly. It affects each employee's pay. That worked in the that's sort of, but it's a little more roundabout.

Speaker 1  1:16:36
Yeah, that that wouldn't be because they have a work order on a week when they didn't necessarily. Yeah, so

Unknown Speaker  1:16:43
that looks confused.

Matthias Miller  1:16:45
Mark, can you walk me through the business scenario? So you've got a driver who works for cheap companies? And and why do you need to make a pool adjustment?

Speaker 1  1:16:56
Yeah, or Okay, here's here's, so we have, we have an employee with a driver's license at one company, that typically he's he's part of ABC to the bonus pool. But occasionally, they'll need him to drive and help for ABC one when they do an on site building. So he may help them for a day or two that week. And so more production gets done there because they have employee from another company helped me helping them. So they they'll just say, Wow, he contributed, you know, let's take too much his pay, let's take his pay.

Speaker 1  1:17:56
Making my story more confusing, let's keep it simple. But a driver that straight hourly, typically, he's delivering sheds, he has no part of production. But occasionally, we'll need him to drive somebody by the onsite crew, and then he'll obviously stay and help build. And so they get more. Or they have like an extra employee per day, for that day. So their pool obviously is larger, and then I'll be paid more and to keep that from getting out of proportion. They'll subtract $150 from the pool that week, and that's just a I feel like it has to remain a management isn't where whoever's actively managing that, you know, says, Oh, my lawn helped with helping, and one do an on site for one day, so I'm going to subtract $250 from their pool. So that their pool is still relative to what it would have been what it is.

Unknown Speaker  1:19:10
Other weeks.

Unknown Speaker  1:19:15
Did that make sense or not? I feel like he

Matthias Miller  1:19:18
does. So one way to work it into the existing system is to have a you know, on site adjustment employee and you give them enough hours to compensate for whatever the pool adjustment should be. But you don't actually write them a check ever. It's kind of confusing, but it's possible. Another option would be having a pool adjustment RG and then showing that on the overview page I see It seems to me from the outside looking in Seth, that it should be relatively localized. fixity that?

Speaker 2  1:20:08
To do that? Yeah. I mean, my main concern is just having another thing to change in the next day, because I don't know how much I mean, I'm running very short on time. Yeah.

Speaker 1  1:20:24
Well, okay, Matthias, where are we tying? Okay, we have these labor intensive buildings, amounts that we're tying to a specific buildings. But where are we tying that? We're not doing anything with that. As far as the finished goods inventory? Are we?

Matthias Miller  1:20:47
Yes, finished, FDA is taking that into account. It's added on top of production payroll.

Speaker 1  1:20:57
Oh, so if so if we're, if we're for a company, that's 10%. And then we have a labor intensive building, we say, well, this, this building is, you know, another $250, add it to the pool. So it'll show up the inventory will show whatever the 10% is plus the 250. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:21:20
I believe so. As well, then.

Speaker 1  1:21:23
Yeah. Yeah, then then that wouldn't work. So, I mean, ideally, what I would like, if I could have whatever right one would, would be the something very similar to that. But just a list on the company overview that here are the adjustments made to the pool? manual adjustments, and, and the reason so you'd have, because I think it is something we will be using from time to time, and there's just four. I say it management decision, meaning it's not something where you can lose or build software to match the logic. It's just things that come up in business where, and he says, well, because of this, and this, I need to increase the pool or decrease the pool by this amount. And it just, he just has a log, or just a reason why. And then you can always go back and see pretty much like we're doing for work orders, but something that wouldn't be tied to any specific skin. But now, so we're running out of time on that so

Matthias Miller  1:22:39
well, I would suggest, I think it's a matter of you determining priority. And so if we can't, we'll, we can lend our prayers and stuff and have a really productive day, but there's not expecting to see the sun to stand still. So So I mean, I think it's just a matter of priority, like let's let's stack rank it where is this in the list? Is there anything out anything where this needs to jump above? What Seth has for today? And if not, then well, you and I are gonna have to get our heads together and negotiate whether is that something I change? Is this something that we do for Duke? Can we've come up with a reasonable workaround, etc. But

Speaker 1  1:23:28
so as far as the rewards and the verification reports, it definitely is not before that. What so where can work in we manually override the company, we can override on the pool, but we can override on production right? In the override at both places. Production only

Unknown Speaker  1:23:53
Yes, production

Speaker 1  1:23:56
that we can overdo a production override in those situations, it would just take a bunch of a bit of math and a decent understanding on how that Yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:24:13
And I think, well, even from a simplicity standpoint, we could add a we could add some editable columns that would all be calculated based on school percentages, probably maybe not speaking out of turn, but where you could, you could say here's the pool adjustment. Here's the starting production, or here's the calculated production number. Here is the pool adjustment. Here's the production adjustment. Here's the final production number, final production number being the one that gets frozen, and and so you could then put in that and that would then be one one It's basically three different ways or however many ways of coming up with the production override. But with some helpers for whoever's in Dwayne's office, he needs to make that make those adjustments. And perhaps the comments field as far as noting, noting some info. That's a pretty inexpensive solution. And probably what I'm doing is grabbing somebody like Jonathan or nick or somebody who shadow me and okay, do that if I have to be the one doing it. Seth, do you have thoughts on that approach?

Unknown Speaker  1:25:39
relatively simple. Yeah. All right. Go ahead.

Speaker 1  1:25:43
Am I understand just to make sure I'm understanding correctly, what you're saying is the information would be sent in and we would say we want. Here's the time cards, and we here's the, we want to add to, we want to subtract $250 from Final, full amount. And so in assists, they would have a other field to enter that 250. And it would say, okay, to get their your production instead of 78,000 should be 70,000. And then they would do a manual, they would manually enter that 72,000.

Matthias Miller  1:26:26
Well, it would, when they put in that 200, they would calculate it as 73,000. But it would store that 72,000 as a production override. So

Speaker 1  1:26:37
but what would show on the company, what would show on the most concerned about what shows on the like the company overview that still show the 70,000 and listed 250? Somewhere? Employee show, my biggest concern is sure we can make it show the right numbers. But if we don't have we're asking production managers to look at a little bit of black magic, if we just saw show the 72,000 and just trust that the pool is correct. So I think what you're seeing, well, I understand that would work just just fine. If we have a way to expose one of those numbers, if we could still show the original production amount. And the adjustment to the pool.

Matthias Miller  1:27:32
I think well, okay, Seth, on a scale of one to 10 how likely do you think it is it's, you'll have a chance to implement this today?

Unknown Speaker  1:27:41
Two or three? Okay, very low.

Matthias Miller  1:27:45
I think I gotta drop for call the top of the hour here. Mark, I think you and I need to get our heads together and just figure out a game plan on that. Okay. Good.

Speaker 1  1:28:00
And then the last thing I had was said, You sent me the verification report or the employee config file, like what you could put together? Am I correct that this, like this report, is something that I could go to Duane and say, here are the columns I want in this format and

Unknown Speaker  1:28:27
read that?

Unknown Speaker  1:28:30
Like configure report, because that was this I should have looked. You send it?

Speaker 1  1:28:55
You export seven, you send it on 726.

Unknown Speaker  1:28:58
Okay, so yeah. So it's like,

Speaker 2  1:29:05
Okay, I think that one's in the live system by now. But it's, yeah. So are you wondering again?

Speaker 1  1:29:19
So had I looked at this when I would have seen Yeah, this would have exposed all the mistakes that were in the system this morning that we fix the rates? So okay, you're saying this, this report? As is in the live system, and it's, it's probably not Yeah, it looks like?

Speaker 2  1:29:40
Yeah, I doubt it. I mean, I assume that takes in it to put it on when it's on the it's on the normal menu just in our system. I don't know how the phone menu works.

Speaker 1  1:29:51
Sure. Well, this is one of those things where I can Yeah, we won't use it very often. I could just ask me export it. Good. I think that So that covers everything I had. Yeah, anything else did you have?

Speaker 2  1:30:08
I don't think so. I just needed. I mean, I'm gonna be time to work on the verifications report

Speaker 1  1:30:15
leaving it or slightly after today, so I'll be out

Unknown Speaker  1:30:20
in the morning tomorrow.

Speaker 1  1:30:24
I will and then Josh is playing to be here by 637 o'clock. Okay, talking Nice. Oh four and looking at his race racing drones.

Matthias Miller  1:30:37
Sure. That's cool.

Unknown Speaker  1:30:40
Figure out which is most important.

Speaker 2  1:30:44
Sorry. Yeah. So I'll probably be around tomorrow morning. Maybe? We'll see. Not in the afternoon for sure. But, so if I have questions, I'll just let you know that but yeah. Oh, we'll get to work on verification reports and stuff.

Speaker 1  1:31:01
Sounds good. This is what has dropped off. Yeah. Ask about his. It'll Monday call but I'll just send him an email. So well, if you are you squeezing in any birding on your on your trip?

Speaker 2  1:31:16
I am actually to say I'm leaving tomorrow because going to Virginia First I've got a one of my friends from Bangladesh and he's an American, but grew up in Bangladesh, just a bit younger than me. Anyway, he's back for the summer. So we're gonna do a day of birding in close to Harrisburg. Harrisonburg, where he's from and West Virginia, try to get really an warbler and some other stuff like that. So looking forward to that. And then our families. We're going to my cousin's wedding in New York, is actually the first one of cousins on either side to get married. But then after that, we're looping back through Canada. Our whole family is just like my dad and siblings, and then mom's siblings. So looping back to Canada, and then the Badlands and stuff. So, hope to get a few lifers along the way.

Speaker 1  1:32:08
What are you in that area? What are you? What are what's on your list?

Speaker 2  1:32:13
I'm like sharptail, grouse. There's still just a few random warblers that I need. I have to let me see where my list is. Again, I had a I had made a target species list, but I'm not sure where I have that right now.

Speaker 1  1:32:29
Yeah. What about like if you go through the Badlands or or north, I guess north there in Canada with like shorebirds, or their nesting shorebirds, while they would be

Speaker 2  1:32:44
I have a high percentage of those shorebirds because of because we got the flyway comes through Kansas. So I've got a pretty good number of those. There's a few shorebirds that I need, but most of those are like coastal stuff, or West like either east or west coast stuff that I don't have. That's those are the main ones that don't have

Speaker 1  1:33:08
you get the what is it? The is it, the longtail Kurla do you get those in Kansas?

Speaker 2  1:33:13
Do I? I don't have one yet because they're kind of sporadic. So that's one that I would be cool to get. But yeah, most of all of them my birding friends here have them have had them at least once or twice and if they've been burning for a while, and they've had them numerous times, there's a place somewhere out in South Africa if it's southwest or southeast, but you can do it the right time of year you can see hundreds or 1000s of them so

Speaker 1  1:33:39
Oh, wow. I saw one in have in southern Colorado that but it was nice. Pretty impressive for but yeah. Yeah, there was one other thing I was like, do you get Scissortail scissor tailed flycatcher? Is

Speaker 2  1:33:57
there one that's breeding about a quarter of a mile down the road from our place?

Speaker 1  1:34:03
Okay, is that I would think a bird like that you just never would get tired of like they're so elegant. Well, I guess I've never seen them but yeah,

Speaker 2  1:34:13
they are. I will say them but they're, they get pretty. I mean, they're pretty common, but I still enjoy seeing them. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:34:22
Yeah. Well

Speaker 1  1:34:25
good. Hopefully you get everything on your target list or at least some some real, real good birds.

Unknown Speaker  1:34:31
Yeah, I'm looking forward to it. Have you are you getting sick days or?

Speaker 1  1:34:38
No, we actually did make it to Crane Creek Magee Marsh this spring. We went as a family the first okay that was a son's five

Matthias Miller  1:34:53
daughters are older than

Speaker 1  1:34:55
him and it was just as fun taking that we didn't have as far as as So we had some unusual birds for there but warblers were real slow trying to think what else we had recently no I'm not I'm not getting out a whole lot but we had we had an interesting day day there we had that real good looks at it for sanitary water, which is kind of unusual for there are no Have you ever made it? No, I haven't a to McGee, Mark. Okay. I mean, if you hit it on a day like that, it'd be a big deal. But if you if you hit if you get there on a day, that's real good, then it could be, you know, maybe 526 species of warblers not just you know, not just one or two but maybe 20 or 30 or 40 I've heard stories but yeah, we had the there was a an American white pelican flew in which those are pretty common. Are they not in Kansas? Or though those

Speaker 2  1:36:08
Yeah, they're pretty common we've got I mean, especially they're not quite as common during the summer but during the winter wealth on Chini or winter to spring will have flocks of two to 400

Speaker 1  1:36:22
Okay, so that was that was an unusual bird for for up there. We had an eared I agree with agree we had that was probably the most spectacular it was along the the impoundments where we they do they open up the refuge I don't want national wildlife refuge for all our tours. And this one was right along the right along the right. Was one of the Greaves the eerder though aren't sure those are probably I think those are more common out with a lot Yeah.

Speaker 2  1:37:09
We don't have them super common but I've got I think I've got both of them. I know I have geared for Kansas plenty of times. Also, I just noticed there's a Ambit out my window. Looks like at least probably. Yeah.

Speaker 2  1:37:29
Anyway, yeah, I kind of I've got to run but on the chat a bit. I'll get to work on payroll and stuff.

Unknown Speaker  1:37:39
Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you. Thank you.
