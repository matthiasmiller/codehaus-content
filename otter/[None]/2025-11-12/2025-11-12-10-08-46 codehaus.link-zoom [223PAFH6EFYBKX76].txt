Unknown Speaker  00:54
Hey, hey,

Matthias Miller  00:58
all right, the two reports immediately above do not return any data or stops giving.

Matthias Miller  01:17
Shows are suggested changes. Okay, well, the reason the reports above are not showing any changes is, well, because the changes are now live, we didn't do an expand expressions before the update. Wait.

Unknown Speaker  01:40
Which reports was he looking at these guys? Oh, the standard reports.

Matthias Miller  01:52
I mean the two reports immediately above, yeah. And yet I still okay, let's go take a look at this one. Let's just, let's just, okay, is posting then had but they're still wrong. AR is too high and bad debt is too low and returns a balance on the report from invoicing and final payment to less. It is double the amount involved in the tax adjustment. Okay, so we have here bad debt. I'm reduced by some amount.

Matthias Miller  02:33
Let's do it really would be useful to I comes to

Matthias Miller  03:24
if it is an A, no, just, let's just do this.

Matthias Miller  03:42
I know it's not that we're not we're not building rocket ships here.

Unknown Speaker  03:46
I was gonna say that's gonna be just fine here.

Matthias Miller  03:56
I don't know what I just

Unknown Speaker  03:57
did. You said not as an A or

Speaker 1  04:05
think that so Id I think, oh, wow, usually

Matthias Miller  04:16
be okay. Maybe I should read before I run. That was an option, reading, writing, arithmetic and running. Now we actually have the four R's.

Unknown Speaker  04:24
That's cool. There we go.

Matthias Miller  04:28
And music would be rhythm. Okay, so

Speaker 1  04:34
I'll give it the old balancing rhythm, but yes, for some of us make music by pounding on my desk. Okay, fine.

Matthias Miller  04:54
I think we kind of need to do a revert of i.

Matthias Miller  05:06
Get out of my way.

Speaker 1  05:14
Come on. Get out of my way. Made me think, side down, side down. Do you remember that from

Matthias Miller  05:25
Did I ever tell you the first time I took a rickshaw ride in no the office? So Allison informed me, you know, bomb, Dicken Dundee and one of them SLIPPED MY slipped my mind.

Speaker 2  05:50
We ended up circling around the block until I finally was able to give you the cake. And I think it finally just stopped. He looked at me all confused, like, Do you know where you're going?

Matthias Miller  06:02
Anyway. Shoot, that's hilarious. I mean, from your from the old office, it was just like, what was it? It wasn't all right, turns until the end. Was it? Anyway? I don't remember what it was. I remember,

Unknown Speaker  06:23
no, it wouldn't be. It

Matthias Miller  06:25
wouldn't be. So I'm not sure how it not, unless it went past the first I don't know how that was. That doesn't make sense to me how that all happened. But anyway, it's my story, and I'm sticking to it.

Unknown Speaker  06:42
I Yeah, I'm not sure how you would have even gotten close the street, sort of wind around.

Speaker 1  06:51
But I also just barely remember how to get if I was there, I could get to the old office, but I wouldn't remember off the top of my head, because don't really go that area anymore, right? Well, right now I really don't

Matthias Miller  07:02
know. Right now you really don't

Matthias Miller  07:09
Okay,

Matthias Miller  07:16
counting, total,

Matthias Miller  07:22
what?

Matthias Miller  07:29
Not sure I should be doing that. But

Unknown Speaker  07:38
what is that?

Matthias Miller  07:53
Away check for updates that doesn't make sense.

Matthias Miller  08:17
Can I do an update? You've got to be kidding me. What is wrong? Something's wrong with my certificates,

Unknown Speaker  08:38
not usually a good thing.

Matthias Miller  08:41
That just stopped working.

Unknown Speaker  08:57
This guy, did you do something to make Addison mad?

Speaker 1  09:05
Probably, did I show you? Ever show you that email from him? Wish I read 116 technically.

Matthias Miller  09:24
Well, I guess here goes. I

Matthias Miller  09:48
now I don't even know exactly who I thought was something like it at,

Speaker 1  09:56
isn't it? Operations that. Ops that You

Matthias Miller  10:55
probably I this

Matthias Miller  11:35
okay, well, so I can't revert, but we think that on the 24th fourth,

Speaker 1  11:45
I could drive in about 90 seconds. If that would help?

Matthias Miller  11:51
Yeah, if I could just have the reverted. Really, all I need is averted macros whenever you have a chance. So the on the 17th, it was invoiced, so the old balance, so we had an adjustment for customer underpayment on the 17th, which was an overpayment, because we said they paid 10, 430, plus tax, so we should have an overpayment of 757, 56 the six, but instead it's showing an overpayment of

Speaker 1  12:27
1512 are you running the accounting impact or just the accounting total for now,

Matthias Miller  12:33
or what I mean, both would be nice. Okay.

Matthias Miller  12:41
Do so then

Matthias Miller  12:54
payments and write offs i

Matthias Miller  13:06
This would be the as of date of 1117, no, get 117 I mean, I

Matthias Miller  13:23
which gives us 11, 186, hang on,

Matthias Miller  13:35
756, which is what I would expect to see so

Matthias Miller  13:51
that's negative. So then there's something else that's screwball. What's the balance? What does it think the balance is?

Matthias Miller  14:16
25 Goodness gracious. Okay, so then, nine, six,

Unknown Speaker  14:24
I sent you the accounting balance. One,

Matthias Miller  14:27
the accounting total as of I

Unknown Speaker  14:42
can't send you the accounting impact. It's too long.

Matthias Miller  14:48
You could email you well, or you could just straight up, you just want to be I don't need to worry about it. You could just actually hear the reports. There's. That one and

Speaker 1  15:00
that, Oh, you want me to be that nice? I mean word, I know I'd be that way. I

Matthias Miller  15:28
accounting total as of is the

Matthias Miller  15:40
I shouldn't this ignore you see my screen. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  16:04
it ignore print sales. Should this only be? Shouldn't this only be sales tax, ignore bad debt as well, like only do you

Speaker 1  16:21
sure it should, but then how does, where does the bad debt? Write off tax? Tax write off part come in? Does that come in, in the payments and write offs?

Speaker 2  16:29
Yeah, okay, because that's kind of what it

Unknown Speaker  16:33
is. So we're just double fixing it.

Matthias Miller  16:34
We are double fixing it, which is wrong.

Unknown Speaker  16:39
Okay, well, that's easy enough.

Matthias Miller  16:42
So do you have your new report now? Actually, I don't even know that I want the new report yet. I was

Speaker 1  16:55
gonna say I don't think we need it. If that's the problem, we can probably fix it.

Matthias Miller  16:59
Let's do the new, new report, yeah. Balance, difference, account, balance as of, let's go change this back to using that one as of copy. It's not a copy. Let's do this as a copy. It's

Unknown Speaker  17:19
payments write off as of, heads of,

Matthias Miller  17:32
okay, and then that.

Matthias Miller  17:50
I Please tell me you find something well that looks like an improvement.

Unknown Speaker  18:02
Yeah, I don't hate that.

Matthias Miller  18:05
Okay, well,

Matthias Miller  18:13
okay, so then here, because the we're not, not showing any changes. The reason is because those changes are already live, we found another bug in our total calculations. You can view our proposed changes here. I mean, I think I feel confident enough in this that we should just, yeah, I think so which I can't which I can't do, because I just got booted.

Speaker 1  19:00
Like I said, I'm pretty sure Addison got mad at me with that. Yeah, did I show you that email from him back in the day?

Unknown Speaker  19:09
You did. It's been a minute, but you did.

Speaker 1  19:14
I had to take that up. Talking about this. There was this one pretty good. Oh yeah, Seth was being uppity and asked me if CLS ID and imports were interruptible. I noted that the young periodically challenged the alpha in the group, but confidentially went to verify, confidentially, confidently, my assertion that imports interruptible, not all. Anyway it was that was one of this rather than a technicality, that's kind of the only reality win when it comes to software development. The technicality was I was right and he

Unknown Speaker  19:51
was wrong. That's funny. Oh man, okay.

Unknown Speaker  19:57
Zfp, let's un. Be my Undo,

Unknown Speaker  20:07
and then update again. Then

Speaker 1  20:14
it's literally just that one change, right? Yeah, change which type it's looking at. Yep.

Unknown Speaker  20:27
And yes, I know I need to change from not equals To equals.

Matthias Miller  20:36
Sales tax adjustment boom. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  21:02
hang on, go back in there,

Matthias Miller  21:09
if is in a right, yep,

Speaker 1  21:16
that tax adjustments handle pain. I What, and this is not related to me, but canonical configuration.

Matthias Miller  21:36
Canonical Configure. I always have canonical configurations. That's my

Speaker 1  21:41
favorite technique. Every morning, I wake up and it's like, it's another canonical configuration kind of day. What I'm saying,

Unknown Speaker  21:58
okay, that's accounting balance. Is is it?

Speaker 1  22:07
No, we're fine with saying the accounting total is higher, because this literally is

Speaker 2  22:13
write off bad debt has nothing to do with the total. Boom, wow. It's just smart we are now. No, you're don't tell us earlier, but

Speaker 1  22:29
exactly, well, that makes sense. I was very confused why I was doubling. I'm sure there was, I was sure there was something wrong, and it wasn't sure what. Okay, so then the other one, he was surprised by the transactions. Is that going to be a parallel bug by what

Matthias Miller  22:43
transactions for the transactions, right?

Speaker 1  22:47
That he didn't think so. Okay, well, let's go. Where's the fix? AR sales impact.

Matthias Miller  22:56
No, I want to run the I want to run the grouped by account and see what the net impact is to accounting. I'm going to take over because I'm a control freak. So he just says, okay,

Speaker 1  23:20
so dumb I've been I've worked with you enough to not have anything to say about you being a control freak. I know what you mean.

Matthias Miller  23:32
Okay, sure. Okay, so the AR was up by 11, down by 11, which is bizarre.

Speaker 1  23:46
What are the dates on that? So on the it was wait debit to AR is that AR is an

Matthias Miller  23:57
asset. Is an asset to the increases AR,

Speaker 1  24:01
we credited it by more than we Oh, because we were expecting that much, and where our bad debt stuff was wrong. So when we got a bad debt row, then we wrote off that whole amount, but we shouldn't have. So that's right, because we the other ones. It's just fixing it.

Matthias Miller  24:25
Sales tax was 756, 18, which should be 7056, well, okay, but

Speaker 1  24:31
that's wrong. Again, that's the sales tax on the 10, 430 instead of on the subtotal or on the right.

Matthias Miller  24:40
Okay, so let's go to, yeah, invoice for 97 that's correct, bad debt expense. We had said 10, 430, and then we said, Nah, it's correct. It's a lot less, lot less 97 something. It's 9725 or something, it's 97 25 so yeah. Now if we go to the transaction, so if you group by transaction, so on the we invoiced it, we said, we need to get 10, 430, great. And then we said, and we said we had revenue and sales tax liability, perfect. Makes sense. Then we have the first payment where we said, where we overpaid too much sales tax, and then we added this back in. And then we over, over, over, credited AR. Then we said, Nan, Nan, Nan. This one, so 756,

Unknown Speaker  25:42
this is exactly right

Matthias Miller  25:43
in minus point 12, 750, 606, which is exactly what we would expect to see.

Speaker 1  25:52
Is what the main tax amount is like. If you look at the Oh yeah, just on the sales order, it's 70506 that's what we're coming out to

Matthias Miller  26:01
seven to 506, and then the bad debt. We didn't have that much bad debt, right? And then AR we over, did a little bit. Okay, so over to his thing.

Unknown Speaker  26:13
We run. We won this round one. Technicality.

Matthias Miller  26:15
We want this around the technicality. Okay, see if I can. No, that's not what it's looking for. Is looking for is looking for my incident?

Matthias Miller  26:36
There we go. We reviewed the accounting transactions. The reason for the unusual behavior is because we accidentally over reported bad debt because of a bug,

Speaker 1  26:58
which I think I might have even listed, the incident which we fixed that bug in up above somewhere, in case we Want that I

Matthias Miller  27:11
don't really care. And then on I

Unknown Speaker  27:35
I don't know what I'm missing, but it sure looks right.

Matthias Miller  27:38
I did. I agree I would, well, and I mean, it looks wrong, but it looks right.

Matthias Miller  27:56
Okay, good. June, reply back and tell him that we looked at it. And we think we're we want on a technicality,

Speaker 1  28:05
yeah, well, he I think it was a tie, though, because we were wrong on one count and right on the other. That's right, we were.

Matthias Miller  28:17
We owe him a coffee drink for the bug bounty. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  28:23
And he owes us a coffee drink for a false

Matthias Miller  28:29
bug report. Yeah, that's worse.

Speaker 1  28:36
The Accounting total had a bug account totally used in the AR report. Add a bug we just fixed, the transactions. Look right. See comments

Speaker 1  29:01
that sent off. Were we still wanting to figure out rounding? Well, there was something else too

Matthias Miller  29:10
I need. Okay, good. I just want to get the monkey off my back on this stuff, the rounding we need to get okay. Now I did or something. I want to cancel our call this afternoon. I'm trying to do a data migration for GPA, and it's

Speaker 1  29:27
and, yeah, yeah, I will gladly let you go have fun with that. All right, yeah, shall we schedule something that for later this week? Yeah, let's do let's

Matthias Miller  29:42
see. Because

Speaker 1  29:43
we wanted to look at rounding and we were also thinking we should try to clean up the shared logic. If we can do you

Matthias Miller  29:50
want to do something like, wait, you have a meeting. When did you say your meeting is on

Speaker 1  29:57
Friday? Not there? You did 10. Central 10, central zone nine, mountain

Matthias Miller  30:11
930, to 10. So let's do let's do 10 to 12.

Unknown Speaker  30:25
Are you working with Dwayne then today?

Matthias Miller  30:28
Yeah, I've got a call with him that I want to clear my head for just a little bit. It's been kind of Yeah, crazy

Unknown Speaker  30:33
morning. Yep. Sounds great.

Matthias Miller  30:36
Okay, awesome. Thanks. Thank you, sir. Yep. Bye.
