Unknown Speaker  00:14
Everybody Well, hopefully you can

Unknown Speaker  00:43
it's fun to go play. I can't hear you.

Unknown Speaker  00:59
Nope, still not I hear something, oh, there we go.

Speaker 1  01:15
You're shaking your head like I know not know what's happening to you.

Matthias Miller  01:38
Ooh, I know what it is. Ah, there you are. If I put my headset on up while before I turn it off, it mutes and then put it down before I turn it on, it doesn't unmute so I just got to go.

Speaker 1  01:54
Such little details, such little details, user details,

Matthias Miller  01:58
user details, um, well, I can't run your thing. Oh, bummer. But you can share your I mean, no,

Speaker 1  02:09
I keep forgetting to go to, what's McCall it? Share. I keep forgetting to go. Enable. Hold on. Let me see. Do I have clawed up yet. Okay, Claude, Claude, Claude, Claude, Claude, how do you share from Claude, Claude, how do you share

Matthias Miller  02:27
top right? I think somewhere I don't really have an account, so, oh, well, maybe that might throw a wrench in your bummer.

Speaker 1  02:37
Anyway, I was, I was moderately impressed. Okay, let's just put it this way. I am moderately impressed every single time I go mock something up from a web page standpoint, and just watch an AI sit there, just write code 100 miles an hour, and it's just fun. But yeah, I mean, if Justin comes back with anything, like, if his comes back five times better than this. I mean, we're getting somewhere this is pretty cool. Wish I could share it with you. Okay, how can I share this? How can I share this? Okay, okay, walk me through how to share for zoom, I always forget how to do this.

Matthias Miller  03:21
Go to Settings, systems, settings, accessibility,

Unknown Speaker  03:26
go to zoom. Vision, not vision, sure, accessibility,

Unknown Speaker  03:39
thoughts like screen control or something,

Matthias Miller  03:41
or maybe you go to just search for zoom. Let's try that. No how to enable zoom, sharing on Mac go to

Matthias Miller  04:01
security and privacy, security and privacy, then go to security and

Speaker 1  04:09
privacy, security and privacy, Where is security and privacy, privacy and security, okay,

Matthias Miller  04:22
accessibility.

Matthias Miller  04:29
And then enable zoom,

Speaker 1  04:31
uh huh. Use, okay, got it, let me see.

Matthias Miller  04:34
But there's more to that, I think. And then go to screen and system audio recording.

Unknown Speaker  04:46
Screen time. No, not screen time. Where do you? Where is screen and audio recording?

Matthias Miller  04:54
Screen and system audio recording, it's under, under what privacy? Privacy and. Here to you,

Unknown Speaker  05:08
zoom, quit and reopen.

Unknown Speaker  05:55
Hey, finally, okay. Now where's my window? I just hate this.

Speaker 1  06:04
Where did I put the window? Where did I put the window? Go away. Go away. Go away.

Speaker 1  06:17
Oh, there it is. Mine is a bat today. I think it's an age thing. Come over here?

Speaker 1  06:33
Is this the one that I want to look at? I think so. Okay, share. I

Unknown Speaker  06:43
application windows. Here we go. Share. All right, now you can see, yes,

Speaker 1  06:49
yeah, let's make this big, big, bigger ish. All right, yes, yep. So overview, which I thought was kind of cool, like, like, this was a kind of cool overview. The biggest impression that this thing gave me was, I really like the contact support thing. Like, contact support, it's like, select your, select your building, select your what you want, type in blah, blah, blah, submit request, puts the pass request down here. I really like that. That's kind of cool. Documents was kind of cool. Pretty straightforward, yep, payments was is no janky needs better work payment history, pretty cool. I did like this. If we can figure out Help Center to look something like this, that's pretty cool.

Matthias Miller  07:41
Main thing we need is an icon, or what,

Speaker 1  07:50
maybe I don't know. I don't know. I thought, I thought it was kind of cool just to, just to kind of like, I feel like I've had a little bit of blank slate problem with this conversation of what, what this should look like, and so, I

Matthias Miller  08:05
mean, in my mind, that's kind of what Justin's here to fix. But, yeah, I can totally see this be helpful.

Unknown Speaker  08:20
Okay, sweet.

Matthias Miller  08:33
Sorry, I'm gonna, we're gonna loop you in on the conversations with Justin. It's probably a lot of noise, but I figured the transparency doesn't Probably speeds up more than it slows down. Okay, do

Matthias Miller  09:06
Okay, so, where do we? Where do you want to go today? Hold on,

Speaker 1  09:20
I'm getting rid of a bunch of a bunch of windows because I got 1000 things open. Hey, when I do this to myself, Where do I want to go today?

Matthias Miller  09:30
I bet we clean up just a handful of priority stuff, and

Unknown Speaker  09:33
then that's a great place to start,

Matthias Miller  09:37
because we're getting very okay. We got this is solid. This is solid. This theoretically needs to be cleaned up at some point, December, ish, I almost wonder if we should do something like, do we want to clean up these in the let me,

Speaker 1  09:55
let me. Stop editing here. Why am I showing editing? Stop it. Stop it. Okay, there we go. I'm the lover editing.

Matthias Miller  10:04
Maybe we should. Should we do a pass through the December section and see if there's anything that we should be cleaning? I just address two dues here. Yeah, commissions. How soon do we need to handle commissions?

Unknown Speaker  10:19
What do you mean by commissions?

Matthias Miller  10:21
Commissions on sale a building or something I don't know. Commissions spring okay,

Speaker 1  10:35
that just to clarify resale of a building, not mediums,

Matthias Miller  10:43
yes, specifically for this commission. So I'm assuming that's the case, because

Speaker 1  10:48
you could, because for a commission thing like that, we could just literally go create a one off bill and and handle it. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  11:13
I have no idea, in manufacturer settings,

Unknown Speaker  11:23
what are we even talking about? Let's

Matthias Miller  11:26
pull up the manufacturers,

Matthias Miller  11:33
these guys. Should we just ditch the RGS and just let you change the percent and have it automatically add new rows, effective today. And if you want to drill down deeper, you can modify it.

Speaker 1  11:49
Okay, I don't 100% know what you're how you're referring to that, but, but my concern is that on both the resale commission and effect and premium percentages. Those do change periodically, and so being able to date them so that you is still key. So are we, we still have that?

Matthias Miller  12:07
Yes, are they going to normally be dated?

Speaker 1  12:13
I mean, I could, I could very much see, like you're you renegotiate something with a manufacturer, and it's like, well, on January the first, we're going to go to 4.25% premium, but then you just go drop it in with the date, and then after that, everything just calculates correctly.

Matthias Miller  12:30
Okay. So then I think this is basically a two Seth. Normally we don't update them day of so maybe just a warning, or maybe disallow editing historical rows unless you check a checkbox, edit historical rates. Do?

Matthias Miller  13:19
Hmm, we I mean, what happens when you change the premium,

Speaker 1  13:23
then the next building you buy that, if it's after the date would be at the new number.

Matthias Miller  13:31
So then, do you actually need anything? Do you need even need historical items?

Matthias Miller  13:41
What do you mean? Explain, like, if you edit, if I change this to 3% we're not going to change

Unknown Speaker  13:52
buildings we already purchased. No.

Speaker 1  14:02
So if I was, if here's my best explanation, the purchase date, or the effective error, what are we calling it? On the on the product record we have, we have a date for this per, yeah, purchase date. If the purchase date is prior to it falls within the range of whatever date is on that on the premium RG, then it's that date. If it falls after the new date, then it's the new number.

Matthias Miller  14:28
So let's get rid of the override, right? No, the

Speaker 1  14:31
overrides needs to be there because it these are the the manufacturer premiums are going to calculate. But the moment some there may be a time where you want to be able to be able to override and stomp something in manually,

Matthias Miller  14:43
right? But, but we should still, if we're freezing them, what's the point of an override? We'll just default it

Unknown Speaker  14:52
after what point do you freeze it?

Matthias Miller  14:56
Well, do you freeze it?

Speaker 1  14:59
I would. Say after you've paid the premium, you should freeze it.

Speaker 1  15:18
Something about this, something about this does not feel right. Matthias, this whole premium calculation thing, it being fielded there on the product. That's really an accounting thing. Why? Why are we? Why does it, why are we fielding it here?

Matthias Miller  15:36
Well, do we need to, like, why wouldn't you just when you create the bill for the premium, just create the bill for the right amount

Speaker 1  15:45
and tie, tie the product ID to it, yeah, and it would show up in accounting transactions. Or would it show up in accounting

Matthias Miller  15:58
transactions? Yeah, if you create the bill,

Speaker 1  16:01
yeah, so it would show up in accounting transactions. I don't think it's, it feels, it feels weird to have it here on the product. And so if depending on, okay, so let's, let's say, Well, okay, how do you, how do you, how do you say this premium is owed and we have paid it or we have not paid How do we? How do we handle incurred premium? Yeah,

Matthias Miller  16:56
I mean, that's convoluted, but

Unknown Speaker  17:14
but again, how do we track incurred versus paid?

Matthias Miller  17:22
Well, wouldn't you just do a real time calculation where this would show manufactured premium percent, meaning manufactured premium dollar. Okay, but how do you know if you've short paid, or if that's actually what you should have paid or you get a special arrangement. Well, that's, that's, I'm saying that's what you're after. Yeah, that's what I'm after. I

Speaker 1  18:03
mean, maybe we keep the fielding here it when, when does that dollar value generate that would be at the point of entry, correct,

Matthias Miller  18:13
maybe a real time calculation at any, any given point. Okay? And it, and then you would have the, the we would have the I would, I would change it to something like this, premium, percentage, premium owed, owed.

Matthias Miller  18:46
Premium paid?

Matthias Miller  18:55
Why balance?

Speaker 1  18:56
Why wouldn't you just tie out? Why wouldn't you tie out the link to the vendor, to the to the bill that that paid it

Matthias Miller  19:02
because you want to. I mean, well, I mean, with the you would, yeah, okay, this is, yeah, yeah. I see what you're doing.

Speaker 1  19:14
But can we? Can we shove this underneath some sort of view button or something? I don't does it. I don't feel like it needs to be visible out on the detail screen.

Matthias Miller  19:25
Do you? Do you want any information about the premium having been paid?

Unknown Speaker  19:33
Do I want it visible? You're saying, yeah.

Matthias Miller  19:35
Do you want anything about whether or not we paid a premium or anything like that?

Speaker 1  19:40
I mean, I think it needs to be there, but I don't, it doesn't need to be on top layer.

Matthias Miller  19:45
So do you want it as a card down beside resell and buy back, or do you just want to be a button here? Manufacturer, premium?

Speaker 1  19:53
Yeah, that's kind of what I was thinking, just a button and the override and the dollar value and all that just goes up underneath it. So it's just, it. Out of the way. It feels like, it feels like information that's not helpful to the average user. Like, I don't think there's, you're not going to spend a lot of time. You're not going to look up a lot of records and go looking for that information on the record level. If you're going to do that, you're going to go run reporting against it and or you're going to be, you know, you're going to do, gonna be doing billing or or something, okay?

Matthias Miller  20:25
But wouldn't it make sense to have an unpaid premium dollar amount with a button beside it for details, like, if somebody like the first like, if there is one piece of information,

Speaker 1  20:35
okay, I'm gonna pose to that in red. In red. I like things that are unpaid to be in red. Oh,

Matthias Miller  20:52
I again, completely up to you. It just seems like, if you're dropping in here and you just need a quick like, that's the one that's fair. I'm not opposed to that.

Matthias Miller  21:10
In red, most people can't do anything about it, but you're writing the check,

Speaker 1  21:24
I know, but it's like, you know, you kind of want the the person that's, you know, browsing through some buildings, be like, Hey, why is this premium not paid yet?

Matthias Miller  21:35
Premium percentage?

Matthias Miller  21:41
Why wouldn't we get the override checkbox to the amount owed? Right? Right? That's exactly right. Um,

Unknown Speaker  22:09
there you go. Okay,

Matthias Miller  22:15
okay, and then what happens? Do you want to? Well, no, then, then you just, then you just override the ODE, if you need to adjust anything bad about a boom, that's slick. Okay, updating historical rate, I

Speaker 1  22:30
want to say we, we haven't really talked about how to do a whole bunch of bills like so let's say, for example, I pay premiums at the end of the month, and so at the end of the month, and so at the end of the month, I want to be able to come run, run some sort of process, find all my buildings that aren't that they're not paid, and then generate a bill for it, and do all the magic time frame,

Matthias Miller  23:00
Spring has sprung.

Speaker 1  23:06
Because, okay, riddle me this, well, okay, I say spring. The question is, how will, what's the manual work around to do this? Clicky, clicky, clicky, clicky, clicky, clicky, clicky. You're saying, go through every single building.

Matthias Miller  23:25
Well, maybe you generate a bill for all for one, okay, maybe, maybe you're right.

Speaker 1  23:32
But, I mean, I think it's, it's, it's, it's one bill with a whole bunch of these on Okay, no, no, okay. Riddle me this, if the bills support this, then you literally should be able to go create a bill record and stomp in a whole bunch of IDs into it. It just works.

Matthias Miller  23:50
Well, you should be able to write a check. I forget how record structure is, but shouldn't you be able to create a check for multiple bills, right?

Speaker 1  23:59
Oh, are you thinking a one to one ratio of Bill to building.

Matthias Miller  24:02
I don't know that we have to, but it's a theoretical possibility. Or

Unknown Speaker  24:06
is it one bill to many buildings? I

Matthias Miller  24:11
don't know if it matters, but theoretically you need to support paying two bills to the same vendor at the same time. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. So it can be spring right,

Speaker 1  24:24
as long as I have a manual way to generate a bill and drop IDs into it and create it up manually, as long as you tell me I can do that manually from a

Matthias Miller  24:33
bill record, Bill records, or just create 500 bills and pay them all

Speaker 1  24:46
this that's, that's just an x 30 that generates the record, right? That imports the the ID onto the February to spring. I'm, I'm talking out loud as if I'm going to go build it myself. Am I correct?

Matthias Miller  25:00
I would do an X 30, I would do a new record from selected rows or something.

Speaker 1  25:05
So, a link action, yeah, and well, if it's not, if I can do that, if I can do a new record that, how do you generate? Well, initiate RG row, new RG row, sorry,

Matthias Miller  25:19
fill RG from pipe list or something,

Speaker 1  25:21
LRG from, okay, so, so how about this? Make it to do for me that once we get to the point we have to go do this, just make a couple notes underneath this, underneath to do on how you would do this, so that I have it jogged my memory, and I'll just go build something temporarily to get it done.

Speaker 1  25:42
It dilur G from catalyst,

Matthias Miller  26:02
probably not enough, but

Speaker 1  26:06
you did you make it a to do Dwayne, right? A dB, right, yeah.

Matthias Miller  26:11
Okay, you like this? I do

Speaker 1  26:23
I'm gonna, I'm gonna check out for one second here, and I got a district manager or a sales manager that's asking something. It's not built yet. Why are you asking?

Matthias Miller  27:02
All right? It, I'm back. Do you want a forwarding address with an expiration date?

Unknown Speaker  27:19
Good question. Oh. I

Unknown Speaker  27:26
presume it's something that you've done like that before.

Matthias Miller  27:30
I what I would do is I would add a new here, let me, let me type out the proposal.

Unknown Speaker  27:36
It's a, I think it's a kind of a cool thing, yeah. And what happens when we pass that date?

Unknown Speaker  27:47
Something cleans it out.

Matthias Miller  28:15
This is definitely not December, though.

Speaker 1  28:18
This is like, that's like, Okay, that seems like a lot of, a bit of work for how much gain? What's the what's the big gain here?

Matthias Miller  28:33
I don't know, but we can bump it out here and decide later,

Unknown Speaker  28:35
okay, bump it out there, and we'll decide later. I

Speaker 1  28:55
can damage waiver fee be forgiven. No you can take it off of the contract, but you can't forgive it. You can. That's a odd question.

Matthias Miller  29:09
Can Can you take it off mid contract? Yes, um,

Speaker 1  29:24
it's it the Damage Waiver fee is, is a true or false thing, like you can't once. If it's if you have Damage Waiver fee, then you pay the Damage Waiver fee. That's how you stay covered. But if you don't want the Damage Waiver fee, then we take it off the contract and you don't are not covered by the damage of your

Matthias Miller  29:49
fee anymore. We need a process by which to disable dwf for a. Correct.

Matthias Miller  30:21
Do you just want a I

Matthias Miller  30:27
mean, you can't edit this normally. So do you want to, do we want an X 30 button that says, disable dwf, or remove dwf? What happens if you want to add it back on? It back

Speaker 1  30:47
on? Yeah, we would need a way to add remove and add it back again, because the potential exists that yeah, we would need a way to remove it.

Speaker 1  31:04
I don't know. I don't have a good scenario of somebody who added it back on again.

Matthias Miller  31:46
Well, we need to store the fee amount, though, or do we just grab the latest fee amount when you add it back on,

Unknown Speaker  31:58
grab the latest fee amount when

Matthias Miller  32:00
you Okay? Somebody says, somebody said the contract, I don't want dwf, yeah. And six months later, they say, I'm nervous. Can I have it back on? Meanwhile, dwf has jumped prices.

Speaker 1  32:16
Well, it'd be, yeah, it'd be the latest, yes. Okay. I want to, I want to ask Leanne or Francine about this, this. I'm curious what they would do in a situation like this, hold on, rewrite the contract. I

Speaker 1  34:06
Okay, here's the good news and the bad news. The good news is that our policy is that if you remove the damage barrier fee, you don't get to add it back on again. The bad news is, I can't guarantee that every company is going to agree with me on that, so we need a way to both remove it and add it back on again. Well, no, no. Rephrase, we, we, you do. We do need a way to add it after the contract has started. So this would cover adding it back on again. Because there are times where a customer, you know, right after they start the contract, they say, they call us up and say, Actually, I do want to have the damage by your fee, after all. So we do need to be able to add it post contract entry.

Matthias Miller  34:45
But if I, if I have rented for two months, or rent it for a month, and I say, I mean, it only, it only gets added to unpaid months, or does it get added to all months at that point? Or do we need to ask, do.

Unknown Speaker  35:01
What do you mean by unpaid or

Matthias Miller  35:03
okay, I make it. I make it down payment.

Speaker 1  35:07
And no, it's just it, just any, anything that's unpaid or future. Okay, do

Matthias Miller  35:50
There you go.

Unknown Speaker  35:56
Where do I go? Okay, editable checkpoints, including,

Speaker 1  36:18
how do you? How do you going to how are you going to enable it. If enabling it, add the free Road to the RG using the latest value give but what are we going to use to enable it and disable it? Are we going to leave that up to him?

Matthias Miller  36:30
Editable checkbox. Okay. I mean, I was just going to bring it down in here.

Speaker 1  36:39
The edible checkbox adds the plus and minus to it on

Matthias Miller  36:42
save, Okay, do,

Matthias Miller  37:07
let's do this.

Matthias Miller  37:33
I hate this, because I feel like so many of these Things I've answered somewhere and

Speaker 1  38:42
how much, how much time we expect for today. I don't know what my ideas. I have had this crawling back of the neck headache thing that is Oh,

Matthias Miller  38:53
paralyze me. I'm sorry, Juna, bump into the I mean, Juna, Juna, call it a wrap.

Speaker 1  39:03
Do you have do you have any mornings tomorrow? This thing started this morning, and it kind of went away this mid or later in the morning, and now it's back with a vengeance.

Matthias Miller  39:19
I may I'm just not sure how,

Unknown Speaker  39:25
and if not, we can just, we can go, we can go to the we'll just keep tomorrow's thing.

Matthias Miller  39:35
It's, I mean, I can tentatively give you something. We can play it by ear. Much how much time we'll need.

Speaker 1  39:43
I'm afraid I'm going to be completely useless in this call from about this point on.

Matthias Miller  39:47
Okay, well, let's not, let's not, let's stop then. Okay, well, we still made good progress. Hope you feel better.

Unknown Speaker  39:57
Play it by ear for tomorrow morning. Sounds good.

Matthias Miller  39:59
Yep. Some time in that tempering, yeah.
