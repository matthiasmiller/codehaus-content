Unknown Speaker  01:07
How's it going? Good How you doing?

Speaker 1  01:10
I want to figure this out. I want to see what's going on. Um, like I uploaded it. I saw I sent a screenshot to Jonathan. They said, Oh, they accepted it. And I'm like, I can't see it. I don't know why it's not showing up.

Unknown Speaker  01:24
That's bizarre.

Speaker 1  01:25
So let's go to your settings. Go here, share your screen. I think I may have

Unknown Speaker  01:32
an idea. Okay, so

Speaker 1  01:36
we're Yeah, people go to Jonathan Wilson. Right in here. Yep. Okay, full control of everything. And let's look at click the little the three dots or it says assign assets. Click on Edit Business account permissions.

Speaker 2  01:55
Okay, so he has access to everything. That's great. All right.

Speaker 1  02:00
I want to know why I can't see that. So let's try something. Let's see go to data sources in the menu right there. Yeah, the data sources offline event sets

Unknown Speaker  02:18
okay. And go to

Unknown Speaker  02:22
Okay, so that you have October marketing in their

Unknown Speaker  02:25
one on one. Yeah, there's a partner. So he should

Unknown Speaker  02:33
he should be able to see it and give me access to it.

Unknown Speaker  02:36
But I can is he able to see it? That that was

Unknown Speaker  02:41
trying to get a hold of him right now, but he's not answering.

Speaker 2  02:44
I'm sorry. We try this. Because

Speaker 1  02:53
I was going through some training. I was asking some friends. I was like, Guys, it's not working for me. I don't know what it is.

Speaker 2  02:57
So let's see. Works on your end. Let's see. Let's see. Let's

Speaker 1  03:10
go to business settings first, let's go to business. Walk through that process. And see okay, so now go to data sources

Unknown Speaker  03:18
on the slide right there. I'll find events

Speaker 1  03:22
now let's open this up in the Events Manager So on the right that right there let's see because in that specific offline event we should we'll see see there's no data right here. So So

Unknown Speaker  03:38
I have everything ready.

Speaker 1  03:43
Let me see. You know what we're not even friends on Facebook are we

Matthias Miller  03:49
I know that we are we

Unknown Speaker  03:50
are your Facebook.

Speaker 2  03:52
You should be on Facebook. Oops. No No the wrong way. Listen everything this Miller picture me my wife. Yes. All right. I'm gonna minimize this

Unknown Speaker  04:18
all right, check messenger all right

Speaker 2  04:29
all right. Downloading Okay, good actually got here. All right, and then

Speaker 1  04:42
okay, here's we're gonna upload the events because I was trying to upload it and then it wouldn't accept it. And I realized, Oh, I had to add to erase that commas so I figured that out. So when you upload this, like, upload it on your end, I wonder if you may have to add me to this. So I can see it if I tried to get ahold of Jonathan Wilson and he wouldn't answer. Okay. So now go ahead. We're since phone number, click on phone number. Yep. It doesn't have a country code. So let's add no. And then finally select an option and just typing us. There you go first. Okay. Scroll over to the side. We should be okay. Good. We should be able to now go to next next review. Is that available to see?

Unknown Speaker  05:31
No, it's not.

Matthias Miller  05:32
event time accurate timestamp? It's missing a timestamp.

Speaker 2  05:36
Oh, I'll get I'll get I'll get that. I haven't haven't. Let me move the screen over here. Yep. Yeah. Let's see. Where is.

Speaker 1  05:51
My. Yes, I got it here. Let me send you this new one. So go ahead and delete down.

Matthias Miller  05:58
Would it help if I put a plus one at the beginning of the phone number? It'll be

Speaker 1  06:03
fine. Now because it has to have the country code on it. So try the new ones such as copy of service. Okay.

Speaker 2  06:13
So service, select copy of service this guy. Next map

Speaker 1  06:24
from has tiny event now go back to the number thinks that.

Speaker 2  06:28
No does not us. Brilliant. Oh, yeah. All right now? Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  06:40
This is actually something I've never done before.

Matthias Miller  06:43
Is really, yeah. Hey, by the way, sometime, we should geek out I'm doing Have you ever done identity resolution on cold traffic or on? On website traffic? On what? Identity resolution on website traffic pixel pins. I

Unknown Speaker  07:00
know that before.

Speaker 1  07:05
We should still okay, so this one says what some of your events occurred more than catspaw?

Speaker 2  07:12
What was wrong with this one? Missing? Invalid negative? Well, fine.

Speaker 1  07:17
Okay, that's fine. We still have we only have like a few right. Other than that.

Matthias Miller  07:23
Yeah. Then there's some warnings, low match rate, some invalid fields.

Unknown Speaker  07:28
Invalid phone number? Well,

Speaker 1  07:31
yeah, that's part of that site. So let's go up. And let's try to move forward with it. Let's go

Speaker 2  07:36
to Start Upload. See what happened there hashing.

Speaker 1  07:39
So an identity resolution for a website? Is that what he said?

Matthias Miller  07:43
Yeah, so on truepoint, we're getting 50% of our traffic, we're converting through name, address, email, and phone number. And we're working on scoring these against mean, first of all, we're testing lead quality and data quality scoring and against the model of historical customers. Yeah, and then looking at either direct mail, I mean, then you can do one of three things you can you can you can find the the people who match the model, collect the FB kids and push them back into into Facebook. So you say you say this person was looks like a good customer based on our data, like retarget them. Number two, you could do cold email to these guys. Number three, you can have an outbound team dialing numbers, or number four, you can put direct mail retargeting in place as well. Interesting. So,

Speaker 1  08:30
so right here, so the activity should be showing up right here,

Unknown Speaker  08:36
too. What if we go back? Oh, I can't go back.

Unknown Speaker  08:41
Yeah, you can't go back it limits you're

Speaker 2  08:44
wondering what's going on? That's weird. Okay, what if I were Facebook offline conversions. I wonder

Unknown Speaker  08:53
if a friend of mine can help

Unknown Speaker  08:56
I'm free into a car. Have you ever uploaded offline events

Unknown Speaker  09:14
strange

Speaker 1  09:17
because that's where they start loading. And we should be able to create the look alikes based off purchase value all that and I wonder why it's not uploading. And I go let me I inserted a screenshot go hey, it says it received it. We're good. Um, I'm all of a sudden it's like it's not showing. So I'm like, Why? Why isn't it showing? I'm not sure.

Matthias Miller  09:42
Is this the latest file that you got from Jonathan? Yeah, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  09:46
Bummer.

Unknown Speaker  09:50
Come on. Google. Because at the same time, let me change these phones a little bit. I'm

Unknown Speaker  10:06
probably not let's do this

Unknown Speaker  10:26
I'm sure you

Speaker 1  10:27
probably probably need facebook click ID though,

Unknown Speaker  10:32
has the timestamp on it. It didn't like

Matthias Miller  10:38
Facebook and other files said it needs the facebook click ID now. I mean we can

Speaker 1  10:46
friend of mine told me all you need is this the upload it. But then when he got on a call with me it's like a little over a month ago when we're trying to figure this out. He goes, Yeah, you need access to offline events by Prager, you know what? Well, Matthias has access to it. Let's just do it that way. Because I've been trying, and it's not showing me anything.

Speaker 2  11:06
Okay, let me I'm going to clean this up just a little bit. You type form.

Speaker 1  11:16
Jonathan also told me that there was an issue with out of state or out of area leads. With Yeah, and I'm like, Man, I, we're excluding all the states, where it's just those zip codes. I was telling them, I was like, what, I don't think we're gonna get the CPL lower for Indiana, then then 40 bucks. Okay, because looking at this, that the zip codes of the size of the audience, completely tiny compared to North and South Carolina.

Matthias Miller  11:55
Makes sense? It didn't occur to me until yesterday that we had a population density difference. I mean, or an ad spend, whatever it

Speaker 1  12:02
is. So I was showing Jonathan, this, let me let me let me show you something. And you can see the difference in the audience.

Unknown Speaker  12:15
Check this out, see?

Unknown Speaker  12:24
Find it.

Unknown Speaker  12:35
And I feel like I've been failing

Speaker 1  12:40
at these ads. And I'm like, You know what? I? You let me can I share my screen with you real quick? Yeah.

Matthias Miller  12:50
All right. By the way to the point of failing, Jonathan and I were talking about this yesterday, it's part of this is these guys have invested in World Class everything except for world class sales teams. And I'm trying to get them to make that investment. And I at that point,

Speaker 1  13:08
yeah, so look at this. So our this is 17 days ago, like I said, I did some research looking at the size of the audiences we're targeting for both campaigns. discover something that you need to know. I know the CPM is much higher in Indiana campaigns. And I'm not sure we can lower that because the GEOS we're targeting a significantly smaller when you compare the audience size in North Carolina, here's the visual these these are, but this is two pictures.

Unknown Speaker  13:33
Look at this. This is

Speaker 1  13:36
for North Carolina has a lot of zip codes. This last Indiana, it's one little page. I zoomed in on. Yeah. And so next, I'm like, dude, like, I think 40 CPL is great. I mean, for a 3k offer to 25,040 is not bad. I think. You know, I ran high ticket as before, like high ticket offers for 8k 20k. And the highest CPL that I've seen,

Unknown Speaker  14:09
was like 250. Yeah, give

Speaker 1  14:13
me a 250. And they pay a que all day, then I'm happy. But it's it's been challenging man. And I'm like, and then I'm testing out like, I tested out some ads, if you can see the shares that last 600 months or up to 50 years, different angles with the best proven creatives we have proven copy just changing one control of it. And it's just like, it's a tiny audience. It's It's tiny compared to 3000 zip codes.

Unknown Speaker  14:48
And it's like, the North Carolina

Speaker 1  14:50
audience is like, it's on autopilot.

Unknown Speaker  14:55
Yeah, it's an honor.

Matthias Miller  14:57
And it's got number I mean, it's got low Low CPM. CPM is Yeah.

Speaker 1  15:02
And it's awesome. And I'm like, I started, you know. So I mean, it's sort of 500 bucks a month. I'm just trying to keep it low and it generates leads below 15, sometimes below $10 Sometimes.

Matthias Miller  15:18
So do you think there's a possibility of Jonathan's talk to you about this? But client client is? There's a whole host of issues. Okay. I think no, let me let me ask you this one a question for you. With your high ticket offers. Have you worked with high ticket sales teams at all before?

Speaker 1  15:35
I've worked with the when I worked with businesses that had high ticket offers, they had solid sales teams. I didn't work directly with the sales teams. But those guys worked with like Taylor Welch. Go Cole, Gordon Gordon, those guys. Yeah. In fact, he enrolled me to traffic and funnels.

Unknown Speaker  15:57
planket Okay, he started his own

Speaker 1  16:00
program. And so those guys train and all that, you know, yeah.

Matthias Miller  16:10
Okay, so here's the new export file.

Unknown Speaker  16:12
Okay. So if we do,

Matthias Miller  16:16
maybe there are no emails here. Let's do this phone number thing again. No, and this is just a very recent, it's like a single day. Single Day file. So okay.

Speaker 2  16:28
No, us. Okay. This one looks like it's probably MTV for this. Let's see customer details. Phone number. No, us. All right. And then I think di D. What is that? I don't know. Okay, well, it's ignore. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  17:01
All right. So then let's review.

Unknown Speaker  17:03
Let's try that. Out lost my window.

Unknown Speaker  17:09
You know what, that only has one warning.

Unknown Speaker  17:12
uploaded? It's row 24. I mean, it's a small data set. But let's see. Nothing. Wait, wait, wait. Yeah, refresh it and see what happens.

Unknown Speaker  17:30
See, the data should be shown right there. See some videos on YouTube using Zapier.

Unknown Speaker  17:39
But I'm

Unknown Speaker  17:41
clueless. I need to hit up my buddy Josh.

Unknown Speaker  17:52
Let me

Unknown Speaker  17:58
upload offline conversions.

Unknown Speaker  18:08
Why are you asking about

Unknown Speaker  18:09
working closely with the sales teams?

Matthias Miller  18:14
Well, because here's the difference. I mean, here's here's why $40 leads are a problem.

Unknown Speaker  18:19
We're not closing nearly enough of them. And and

Matthias Miller  18:24
they're wanting to client is wanting to stop Google and just go all in on Facebook.

Speaker 1  18:30
What is the Google issue or Facebook and the issue? Like how's Facebook, or Google is doing I don't even know what Google's doing.

Matthias Miller  18:37
Google's got like two to 3x, CPA, CPL versus Facebook. Wow. And conversion rates are about the same. But Jonathan also said, Hey, you guys never set a CBO cap. I mean, we can cap CPL if you want to, at 60 bucks and just kill the more expensive leads. But it still doesn't fix the,

Speaker 1  18:58
the audience. It's the audience size. That's, that's what it is. Compared to this noise, if you look at it, the data is right there. I mean, there's times where like, if you're running ads, and your audience is like 30,000 people versus a million, you're gonna get more results with a million audience versus like, Oh, you're honest, is not big enough. You're gonna see that a lot too. And then that's gonna get stuck in learning limited. Yeah, unless you open it up a little bit more wider, you know, because we're also condensing a part of Indiana, a certain part of Ohio. And we can go further out, you know. It's, this is to me, it's a budget issue is it's an audience issue.

Matthias Miller  19:44
Audience issue.

Speaker 1  19:45
That's what it is. Now, in some cases, they say you have a big audience, and your offers expensive, and your budgets like 100 bucks a day. It's going to be challenging. I'm having that right now with with one client, you know, I mean, their shirts are like $90 trucker hats are like $100. And we're only spending $5,000 a month, and they they expect a 5x return on $5,000.

Unknown Speaker  20:17
There's no, there's no,

Speaker 1  20:19
there's like maybe one or two sequences of email, there's no follow up of, hey, we saw that you picked up like, I'm gonna, I'm gonna give you this. I was working with an eight figure econ business. I'm gonna give you this. Now. Now, this will change any businesses

Speaker 2  20:38
the way they operate customer service. Let me go here. And

Speaker 1  20:48
I had a mastermind with a buddy of mine, that name was Jim. And did this guy is the master at customer service, this is what he did best than than everybody else.

Speaker 2  21:11
send you a PDF. Check that out. All right.

Matthias Miller  21:16
And while we're talking about sales, just found out that my top salesperson closed 60k For the week,

Speaker 2  21:21
closed 60k took a bet against the owner, owner last.

Speaker 1  21:30
Look at that, look at the way it is. The other thing too, is there's no engagement on social or very little, right? Social is all about engagement. And I teach that even to my current clients. So if we go into the account, I even taught that to FIU, online. And they don't care about it. But if you think about social media, it's a place where people can interact, right? They ask questions, they give us a it's garbage, but how you handle that message, how you handle how you talk with them, how you interact with them, it means a lot, and that other people will eventually see that on how you handle those objections. Do you know, you can't win everybody over but, but you could take full advantage of the algorithm by doing that will be like, Whoa, this is, you know, this will help you know,

Matthias Miller  22:32
it makes sense. It's like having a sales conversation on public square

Speaker 1  22:36
100% 100%. And that's what it is. And then, you know, if you go through this, this document when it comes to even like abandon checkout now, this is E commerce, but if you could flip it to whatever specific business it is, and make it your own. Now you have, you know, like your own customer service, you know, experience because that's what it's all about. You know, so to me, when you have a good customer experience, people will then start referring out more engagement. You know, so you go to Cisco here

Unknown Speaker  23:11
and this right here.

Speaker 1  23:15
You know, like you have your click through rate and you got unique CTR. Then you got unique outbound CTR.

Matthias Miller  23:20
This is different screen if you're showing me something. Oh

Speaker 2  23:29
here it is. I see my screen now. Yep. So number one,

Speaker 1  23:35
there's a huge difference in North Carolina. So in the in this area, the CTR, these numbers are killer. Anything above the 2.5 if this the CTR and the CTR meaning that the copy and the image are stellar. People are stopping on it. And that that means that both the copy and the creative are working. Challenging this. There's days where we could get a great unique CTR and a decent you know, CTR, unique CTR. But again, you're not going to get anything like this 1516. But what's what's neat, though, is my go to oh, here it is. Sort of comments. This this checkout. This is North Carolina, though.

Unknown Speaker  24:21
And this one is,

Speaker 1  24:22
I believe this is a new one that we launched. Yeah, this is the thing that the shed the shed offer. It's kind of cool. Look at this, like, we know that these images work. Sometimes you don't have to change a whole lot. It's just like the change to the control. Yeah. Sometimes you don't always have to be on the computer, just test one thing and see if it works. So we have this right here so we have the only shows that can last up to 50 years.

Speaker 2  24:55
Yeah, like that. Dude, this guy Looking for? Look,

Speaker 1  25:02
there's no one to comment on to engage. Let's look at it. Now. Hey, I'm proud of the ones I launched. And they're rocking it.

Unknown Speaker  25:13
Have you seen this? Check this out.

Speaker 1  25:19
I shared this with some people and I say, look, you're missing out on just building engagement. But if you lose out on interacting with that audience, yeah, you're you're going to wish that you just looked at since January 680. Leads attend a 98. So it's what one is broad, which means is no targeting and then one that is targeting. But oftentimes, as long as the business or the ads continue

Speaker 2  25:56
to grow, that's what matters. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  26:02
It grows in engagement, it grows in an interaction, and that's really the key. So we'll have 173 comments.

Speaker 2  26:15
What, are you ever seen this before? I have.

Matthias Miller  26:20
I've not I had a person that I thought was seeing these comments and following up with them, but I'm not.

Unknown Speaker  26:25
It's clearly not happening.

Speaker 1  26:27
We have all these people that can that can be invited. See that. But let me show you let me show you something that most people don't know.

Unknown Speaker  26:36
We will the newest. Okay,

Speaker 1  26:39
so this person is interested, right? So if you go to this document right here, right, it shows you how to engage. But here's something simple. So you could let you on like it you want to reply like thank you for replying to our oppose. We're grateful that you're interested sin.

Unknown Speaker  27:02
Right, then then reply again.

Speaker 1  27:05
What exactly are you interested in? Or is there a specific type of shed you're looking for send and then you can replay again with a gift and now the engagement went from one comment. To right so check this out. You mind if I do it? Now that's fine. Okay, so we have 137 Let's keep that in mind right. And then you got also seven days to send them a message.

Unknown Speaker  27:59
Now what's on 39? Yep.

Unknown Speaker  28:16
140

Speaker 1  28:18
So now the whole thing is if there's more interaction, Facebook will begin showing this to more and more people. Yeah, exactly. This right here is the same thing. This is it, respond by mirroring the comment using their own words, acknowledge what we hear and understand them and create a positive experience that we include a relatable fake meme or gift with the intent of making this more or less.

Unknown Speaker  28:43
Yep. Then with that over LUMION.

Unknown Speaker  29:27
Simple Yep, boom done.

Speaker 1  29:30
You can do that with a lot of others. So, you know, these right here, we can take the time to, you know, answer them tell hey, look, what we're building is custom. You know? Yeah. And I wrote this. I wrote this back in like, June and it works. Show the inside of the shed. That is what blew it sheds so large you can practically live in them.

Unknown Speaker  30:06
Yeah. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  30:08
Oh, by the way, I don't know if we've talked about this. And I don't know if this matters to people. But one of the things that's bothered me a bit about the Online team is that they're not on a physical location. Anybody who steps in a shed, like they can see, there aren't any knots. It's cleaner wood. It's better designed, better structured, and the shoddy inside shed shows that but that is one of the selling points of like a normal ship. It's just ugly. I mean, yeah, it's even the inside looks nice. Yeah. Good stuff, man. All right. Well, I'm gonna Jaysus with my team. One other quick question. I got to drop off. But one other quick question. Does organic posting organic content. Does that help?

Unknown Speaker  30:49
Yeah. Yeah,

Speaker 1  30:52
they're there. Their last post was what? In like, June 2020,

Unknown Speaker  30:59
I believe. Do you?

Matthias Miller  31:01
Do you do that? Do you have people you recommend to do that? How do you do you have a process you recommend for doing that?

Speaker 1  31:07
I have a friend who did who to who I could talk to about that. And Jacqueline, I can introduce you to him. But yeah, oh, crap, like, oh, no, I'm sorry. 2022 is your last post, Jun 10. And I think the more people who come to a social media at come across an ad, they're going to click on the page and see what's going on in the page. If it's not active, you know, but it's gonna, you know,

Speaker 2  31:39
yeah, I think we're all you know, make sense. Yeah, we are. Cool. You want

Speaker 1  31:45
to make that introduction. I can ask him who does he recommend for social media organic postings and see what that looks like?

Matthias Miller  31:54
That'd be awesome. Cool. Cool, man. Appreciate your help. If there's anything you need. I was trying to figure this out. Yeah, we will get out. All right. Take care, buddy. Yeah, thanks, Alex. Bye.
