I can't stop thinking about this gravity question, and I think you know the way that you go from three points to four points. You're introducing a three model. And that is actually quite easy. Because, like if you envision, all of the triangles, and the lines and the edges have to match up, you essentially have a pyramid. And so what you're looking at is how do you how do you adjust the sizes of the pyramids, so that they all match, and align with the minimal amount of percentage adjustment. And so, so I mean you can, if you just, if you do nothing but you straight up cut pieces of paper out and you handle it like that, you're taping these pieces together you immediately see the issue because the issue is, again, B to C. Okay let's let's do this through is every point is actually work. Because what would you actually end up building is a five sided or six sided let's say you have four points. See a three plus two plus one, you have a six sided shape. And your goal is, with the actual actually have to use x y&z coordinates enabled to figure out, to be able to figure out how to position these. And based on the xy and z coordinates, you're then able to build a model and so the end product actually is going to look more like a globe, than it is anything else, or some kind of conglomeration of it. And so, really, as a result of that you have a map, and if you try to put this into a linear fashion or basis, this is crazy. Here in a linear basis, you're going to complete as though this whole thing sideways, you can't do it. This has to be done with an X and X y&z axis.
