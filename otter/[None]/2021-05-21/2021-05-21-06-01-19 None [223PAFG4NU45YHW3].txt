Alright so just a handful of things that I wanted to track one is that I need three more fields or four more fields in the detail screen one of them is the email address of the taker, but I also wanted the name, first name, last name and email address of the person who bought it, and I can't, I don't know what you, what you call that, except just the buyer, and maybe a transaction ID of some kind. The other thing that I was thinking about this morning is having thrivecart Push into push into. Sorry, push it into app, posting and creating i&i style string, perhaps, just as a way to access that information that way less of the bridge is living in. Actually, there could be another way if we just push it into say into a memo so that we get compression on it. And then we have a processed checkbox, and we have a. So when we, when we get the hook we push it to disk somewhere, and then try to shove it up and keep trying. We've got some kind of unique identifier to make sure that these things don't get missed, and then have a checkbox on it, that indicates that the cron shouldn't be doing something with it. which it checks after has processed it. Now, the other option which honestly almost be easier, would be going down the stripe route and just doing stripe billing on the front end. And I don't know if that's something that we want to do, but it would be something that something that would be worth taking a look into, for sure.
