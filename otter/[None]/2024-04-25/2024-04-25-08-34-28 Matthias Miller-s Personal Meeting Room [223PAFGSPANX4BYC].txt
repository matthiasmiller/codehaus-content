Unknown Speaker  00:31
Hello Hello good morning Sorry I'm late here

Unknown Speaker  00:52
right

Matthias Miller  01:06
Okay Ben Ben's not gonna be able to join us until about 11 So we can go ahead and dive into what we got here

Unknown Speaker  01:14
we just start with the agenda that I send out

Unknown Speaker  01:23
wrote cereals

Speaker 1  01:27
I think what the place where you're where we need your help most is like affordable and shed time are at a point where basically January and February have been reconciled all stood on those right I don't think there's any work on those two companies vinyl is where we need your help or where we could use your help so we'll just go through because we haven't established we haven't established all of the stocks available

Unknown Speaker  02:01
to you

Unknown Speaker  02:03
and we're really low so it's only a few episodes follow

Speaker 2  02:17
me up so I think the so we're looking for transactions here that are significant

Speaker 1  02:29
for vinyl yes I'm suspicious actions in there that because I think it had matched at one point

Unknown Speaker  02:43
count let's just do this let me share my screen so you guys can see what's going on

Speaker 2  02:59
so we want those transactions and account Transaction Date is less than or equal to 1231 23 and

Unknown Speaker  03:24
why is it

Unknown Speaker  03:34
that let's group by

Matthias Miller  03:45
alright so for building built

Unknown Speaker  03:50
we can get

Unknown Speaker  03:57
you're

Speaker 2  04:11
too let's actually maybe do another grouping here as well which would be

Unknown Speaker  04:48
so we go to get out of the end we

Speaker 2  05:04
This is the building section so building we're saying what is going out here let's try this

Unknown Speaker  05:33
oh sorry

Speaker 1  05:42
your 34,000 Isn't that that okay your 34,000 is matching the difference? I think I don't have

Matthias Miller  05:51
the 34 difference

Speaker 3  05:52
like 55 I think oh there 133056

Matthias Miller  05:56
reserve report yes that's that's it. So let's do and

Unknown Speaker  06:12
these are probably transactions that that got posted to this account and it shouldn't be

Unknown Speaker  06:21
well what was the other there's just no Pio

Matthias Miller  06:32
these are vendor invoice with no PIO and there's a Pio purchase so AP secondary lows AP secondary lows AP second AP AP so are you fine with AP and secondary lows balance shifting for end of year

Speaker 3  06:51
can you know those loans account um Well yeah, I mean those will need to be figured out are we at with a pH Oh AP we need to work on the interior so

Unknown Speaker  07:07
they are already an AP on the one side right. The one side of the trends okay. Yeah

Speaker 3  07:19
there are some of them are putting it in the AP like that is

Speaker 1  07:24
but shouldn't they all be AP and then the other side? But 1005 105 raw materials footwear journal Lottie Oh,

Unknown Speaker  07:33
right that's what they shouldn't be.

Unknown Speaker  07:35
Got it.

Speaker 3  07:36
We just this is this raw materials is for build buildings are like that one for one of it.

Speaker 1  07:47
But watch it the other side we do we rather well,

Unknown Speaker  07:50
no, that's fine.

Matthias Miller  07:52
If that's what you want to do, then let's just go in here. And change. Yeah, let's change change the vendor invoices and then update the transactions to match. So this should be

Unknown Speaker  08:10
raw materials, raw materials.

Speaker 1  08:12
It also be current assets. Yeah, from bottom.

Speaker 2  08:16
This guy? Yeah. Okay, so let's go.

Speaker 1  08:22
You're saying leave the other, like AP or the secondary low, just leave those?

Speaker 3  08:27
Well, if it says lows, then that's probably coming. While I would have just skipped AP, then we can just wait there's probably a non Pio situation where it didn't match that we had to write more in the non Pio line.

Speaker 2  08:49
Let me let's take a look at this. Let's see if this is going to that one needs switched?

Speaker 2  09:41
All right, and then I had another temporary report that I had for this sky and

Speaker 2  10:03
count and record count trans event record ID with a pipe list

Unknown Speaker  10:32
now that's the right one

Unknown Speaker  10:45
maybe

Unknown Speaker  10:51
no

Unknown Speaker  10:57
maybe I didn't Well the easy way would be just to do this now translate account and stop now you

Unknown Speaker  11:33
there

Unknown Speaker  11:50
how'd you do that? How does it how do you do that?

Matthias Miller  11:57
Well you just copy and paste

Unknown Speaker  12:01
oh okay I thought it just like you didn't even open it up

Matthias Miller  12:09
I mean it's I made it be in editable report and then right no I I

Speaker 3  12:17
just ended up the first time but maybe you got it done before the drop didn't even open it

Matthias Miller  12:22
now. It might just not have come across I did the drop down and then typed in the number

Unknown Speaker  12:30
10 other 515

Speaker 3  12:32
Okay, because in some of the entries that I was doing, like instead of just typing and tab and type and tab and typing tab you got to click on it to open the drop down and then you can type in so I mean I don't know if there's a way to change those I mean not now but like you know, it's where if you tab on to it you can just you can just type in the numbers without needing to open the drop down but no,

Matthias Miller  13:00
but you can use I think you can probably use something like space or something like that pop

Unknown Speaker  13:04
it open.

Matthias Miller  13:05
Okay if you don't want to if you don't want to reach for your mouse

Unknown Speaker  13:08
yeah let's try it Yeah, I mean you could do you can do space okay

Matthias Miller  13:24
all right, let's see what Stephen likes us now.

Unknown Speaker  13:33
Five years later.

Speaker 3  14:27
While that thing is loading I thought I used to have a report four that showed like vendor invoices that are in accounts payable as of a certain date and I cannot find I thought I saved it but I can't find it anywhere

Speaker 3  14:48
like it was kind of the same ideas we had for like undeposited funds or whatever. Like all the stuff that would be in accounts payable Because of an invoice date before the 31st, and then but hasn't been paid until after

Matthias Miller  15:07
the account balance diagnostic. Well,

Unknown Speaker  15:09
there was that. And I've used that but that's not

Matthias Miller  15:16
counts receivable

Unknown Speaker  15:18
payments updates. None of those

Speaker 3  15:27
again, find it anywhere. I mean, thought it would shuffle like counts payable something.

Unknown Speaker  15:33
Let's do this

Speaker 2  15:46
Accounts Payable report and accounts payable metrics. Well, that's

Matthias Miller  15:54
not yet

Speaker 2  15:59
this I think is, was this the discount? Pio? Invoices entered invoice paid Miss discounts. That's something else.

Speaker 3  16:13
Maybe the largest put it there when I needed it. And so I used it.

Unknown Speaker  16:19
Exactly.

Unknown Speaker  16:26
Yeah, I know, I used something like

Matthias Miller  16:31
I can't imagine what it would. I mean, we could I mean,

Speaker 3  16:38
unless it was unless it was just an accounts receivable report. Like it might have been that and it wasn't accounts payable at all. Anyway,

Unknown Speaker  16:53
that number matches, so

Unknown Speaker  16:54
that matches now.

Matthias Miller  16:58
Do you want to look at the accounts payable number while we're here or?

Unknown Speaker  17:03
Want to get back to that?

Speaker 3  17:04
We haven't. I mean, I haven't really gone and done anything with it. So I don't know. I don't know where it's at. I don't even know what it's supposed to be. All right. I mean, besides what witnesses are supposed to be, but

Speaker 1  17:18
you came up with a number that we gave, right?

Speaker 3  17:23
Yeah, I mean, I looked at the account. But I haven't been able to verify if that's still like it has changed because some things moved. You know, we change dates on some things.

Speaker 1  17:38
I'd say if we're here, let's Why don't we look at AP. Now, I mean, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  17:45
Tablets a bit of insert is

Speaker 1  17:48
that you're not? Like you want to redo what you did to get it the first time basically.

Speaker 3  17:55
Or, well, what I want to do is basically validate that what we're saying is it was valid is actually still valid. Like that's why I was wondering, can we just get a report that says, here's my here's the invoices that were payable as of 1231.

Matthias Miller  18:19
So this would be a vendor invoice report

Speaker 2  18:21
and not bi invoice, do we have a and b invoice date is less than or equal to 1231 23 and B, invoice payment date, payment day is greater than

Unknown Speaker  18:44
1231 23. And, and VI accounting V i Sea and the accounting company its final structures. I guess the invoice, Id the invoice payment? No, the invoice total. And we would do a sum and make this guy be the link. And

Matthias Miller  19:27
I mean clearly there's a discrepancy here between these two if I'm doing my report right now, do we have we

Speaker 2  19:35
don't have a concept of these being voided. Oh, here sorry. It could also be a date or I mean it shouldn't be but it could be

Speaker 3  19:56
I mean, there's there is a journal entry in there. You know, that I corrected with last time? So that one show different

Speaker 3  20:17
and we don't have. So there's a there's a 42,400. About four to five, journal entry. That's, that's gonna create a difference between what our balances and what we're actually going to show.

Matthias Miller  20:37
I mean, but we've got things from way back here that are showing

Unknown Speaker  20:46
unpaid. Yeah,

Speaker 3  20:47
and the reason like, those are pretty much just gonna be because the other half didn't, you know, it was it was before before things got pushed over.

Matthias Miller  21:03
Right, so if we limit it to 621

Speaker 2  21:08
than that, let's sort by the invoice date. Yeah, all right. So then

Matthias Miller  21:16
we have payment date? Well, you know, I mean, according to that, here, let's do this.

Speaker 3  21:27
I mean, they shouldn't. Like if it's only half the transaction, they shouldn't be showing a payment date after January 1. You know, so that's going to weed out those ones that are that are incorrect back there

Matthias Miller  21:51
here's everything from June. It looks like it looks like these early ones were paid in January. And then we're into November and December which

Unknown Speaker  22:04
is probably crack.

Matthias Miller  22:10
Like there's, well this one's this one's a little strange. We've got to get a Lowe's

Unknown Speaker  22:18
looked like, oh, that has nothing that just needs gotten rid of. Oh,

Matthias Miller  22:28
Jimmy, just to change the total to zero.

Speaker 3  22:32
That would work. See if there's any accounting transaction connected to that, like would there have been something that got voided out or something weird? Doesn't appear to be Oh,

Matthias Miller  22:47
I mean, we could

Speaker 3  22:49
I mean, I found POS but we have no idea. I mean that Pio could be connected well, it's not connected something else. Maybe supposed to be connected to this. I'm looking at a is there an attachment with the invoice that shows what it might have been?

Unknown Speaker  23:12
It's a good idea. Nope,

Unknown Speaker  23:15
no attachments.

Matthias Miller  23:18
No here

Unknown Speaker  23:21
No, that one's not tied to the eye.

Matthias Miller  23:24
So you haven't received that voucher here. This is a no these are all that's like these are all future

Unknown Speaker  23:35
right? Yeah. And it goes right back to order stuff.

Matthias Miller  23:39
The other thing we could do is vendor invoice

Speaker 3  23:45
started and got sidetracked and started over again Yep, right there's no real Yeah, so that other one just needs to leave it

Unknown Speaker  24:01
okay

Speaker 3  24:10
all right. I mean, that's yeah. I'm not actual logistics and none of that religion. Some of these I recognize. INS Okay, so that's showing 145 And what were we

Speaker 3  24:45
oh, that's 250 bucks off. I know what that 250 is. Is that CMH homes right there. Close to the bottom. Got it because And she needs to add that we would have to add that to her to her list so then we would be on track with that

Unknown Speaker  25:26
we at least do this so that we've got something

Speaker 3  25:33
well, I might I might double check that against the account balance diagnostic but I'm pretty sure that that's solid because that $250 would have been a change since the last time we hit us

Unknown Speaker  25:50
so okay

Unknown Speaker  25:53
that was good

Speaker 2  25:57
we're gonna go see if I can find my now maybe not I was gonna see if I can find my old report that I had created and didn't say but

Unknown Speaker  26:25
that's fine. Okay, so looking over at this guy let me pull it up

Matthias Miller  26:59
the ETA was one alright Do you want to whoops

Speaker 2  27:13
Let me grab my agenda again be a total of three files employment agency LLC breakdown I think I've only got one file

Unknown Speaker  27:44
are the other files the same?

Matthias Miller  27:48
Okay, it's a similar style breakdown just different companies.

Speaker 3  27:53
Um yeah, so this is this is the Burkholder employment so these are actually not being broken out the way they had earlier. It's just all goes to this one because I forget what all it had been going to but it all is part of sales wages, I think it was broken out into the liabilities and that kind of thing. So a bunch of these are entered as that breakdown this one here there's this little to do with anything. So these are all invoices from Burkholder employment agency but for the three companies

Matthias Miller  28:46
and so what needs to be done verify these

Speaker 3  28:50
have been entered as well, for vinyl strike ABC and shed dime are mostly done on these. They might actually all be done but vinyl structures will be where the entry needs but they've been they've just been entered as Uncategorized expense. So they need put in as the sales expense. Sales wages. So this is something that's way below your pay grade. Final about pay grade but but

Matthias Miller  29:24
skill level can can we so let's Okay, so for each of these I guess I wonder if this is something bad if you'd be willing to do this. So for each vendor invoice would you say you say ABC and September mostly Then does that mean we still need to go double check?

Speaker 3  29:51
I wouldn't well, for Burkholder employment yes because they might be broken out differently but Do you have the Do you have the one to file for? Like Brookover transporter sending the file manager? Okay, that one's done.

Matthias Miller  30:13
Okay, like this one is not does not appear to be entered at all unless I'm missing something. Oh, and five.

Speaker 3  30:18
Okay, some of the early ones, some of the January ones I just entered as transactions because I forget what it was. So they're all entered as a lump sum as a transaction, some of them have invoices behind them, and some don't.

Speaker 1  30:34
So quickly search by the LCD, so you

Speaker 3  30:38
could look for the number or look for the transactions. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  30:45
So we could do a this would be pretty easy to do create a report mean really the transactions by contact?

Unknown Speaker  30:59
Worthy if we would just take this I don't know if we have a

Speaker 2  31:16
and then we have a contact via an account account transfer, duplicate invoice. An account by contact?

Matthias Miller  31:29
No. Okay. Building a reportable transactions

Speaker 2  31:33
by that vendor might be the easiest way. Okay, so Burkholder management

Matthias Miller  31:43
so ones that are missing? Do you want missing ones entered as vendor invoices?

Speaker 3  31:48
Well, we talked about that song, I don't know that it would have to be like, if it is just as a transaction, it can just stay as a transaction.

Matthias Miller  31:58
Sure, but new ones that are missing come in as

Unknown Speaker  32:01
vendor invoice. So,

Speaker 3  32:02
um, you know, how late how far? Do you have April's on

Speaker 1  32:08
here? I, I have everything here that you had sent me. So. Okay,

Speaker 3  32:12
but there shouldn't be anything missing? Because because we've paid the bill. So if it's missing, I mean, yeah, it needs answered if it's actually missing, but

Speaker 1  32:22
you're pretty sure that you have all of them entered as like as

Speaker 3  32:26
a lump sum. Yeah. So like this, on the green side here would be all the things that the lump sum is supposed to be expensed out to all those different ones. So I don't know if there's a fancy report way to

Speaker 1  32:46
what happened happening with those DS for numerous reasons, we're not going through AP, the general process, the standard AP process, and so Drew is getting these paying them and then on the backside, there'll be broken down to the correct expense account, basically.

Speaker 3  33:15
So, I mean, it's really just changing transaction entries is all it is. I don't know if there's a faster way to do that than just type them in and go or not. Let

Matthias Miller  33:29
me make sure I got this right. So all the transactions are in we're only changing the breakdown of the transaction. Okay.

Speaker 1  33:47
Your route, do you think it would be helpful if you were to take one and just show Matthias but you do. The manual Prophet

Unknown Speaker  33:58
pull up ABC

Matthias Miller  34:06
just got to be a I hate the fact that this is so Okay. Let's let's do Okay, so let's say that we use this report. The date would be 116.

Speaker 2  34:19
Hopefully, and it's ABC and we're going to be account is changed.

Unknown Speaker  34:26
Doesn't Sure. Like we are

Speaker 3  34:29
Yeah, I mean, you don't have to worry about changing any dates, but there's some dates that might be slightly different. Slightly varied.

Speaker 2  34:37
Okay, well, good news is looks like we found it like

Speaker 3  34:41
that one. Okay, so this one has been broken out.

Unknown Speaker  34:47
Got it, you know, so

Speaker 3  34:49
instead of all those first, what dozen lines it just was Uncategorized expense for the same amount as the primary checking credit line.

Unknown Speaker  34:59
Okay, Ah, got it.

Unknown Speaker  35:02
So there's nothing to do on. Right, this one, this one.

Matthias Miller  35:05
Okay, so let's begin would you have if I walk you through what needs to be done here? Would you have time to get these straight now?

Unknown Speaker  35:19
What's the deadline on?

Matthias Miller  35:23
What is the deadline?

Speaker 3  35:27
I don't know. I mean, I'd probably get to them by Monday, if they weren't done would be my guest.

Unknown Speaker  35:37
So

Unknown Speaker  35:40
my deadline would probably be tomorrow evening or so.

Speaker 3  35:44
Yeah. I mean, it's thing is, it's not so much as a deadline, it's just I'll get to doing it. If we don't get it done, I'll get it, you know,

Matthias Miller  35:57
it's better to do it. So I mean, it is a matter of keeping your free with this and leave it right here.

Speaker 4  36:04
I could do at least some of them, I don't know how many I'd be able to get done before tomorrow evening. But I could get at least some of them done probably.

Speaker 3  36:15
Well, most of the work, most of its gonna be vinyl structures, paying for gold or transport and Burkholder. Management. So I would say don't even spend time to open all the rest. If you're, if you're rushed for time, those vital structures, paying those two is gonna be where all the, like 95% of the entry is gonna be. Okay. So

Matthias Miller  36:50
I wonder if we could?

Speaker 1  36:56
Well, what would it take to create to do to just run an import, like we do for payroll, that does all the transactions?

Speaker 3  37:14
Do we have to create a match key or something for these that it would update family?

Matthias Miller  37:20
I wonder if we could do an in between solution where we have a report, we can probably almost create a report where you would copy and paste you would just select the invoice here or you a copy of the invoice date. And you would copy in the account breakdown and and select the company they would find something within it's gonna be within a week. Either way, won't it?

Speaker 3  37:47
Well, if you use the if you use the invoice number that should that should nail it. But yeah, the date should be within a week.

Matthias Miller  37:58
But there is no invoice number here.

Unknown Speaker  38:01
Some of the Oh,

Unknown Speaker  38:02
some of those earlier ones. That's right.

Matthias Miller  38:07
So you do a search. And then we could and then you paste this in the calculates the totals to find the matching transaction. And then we write a Modify button that deletes deletes the non checking row and adds these rows in

Speaker 3  38:32
Well, it sounds great to me. I mean, part of part of giving you this assignment is to come up with with a fourth way is to use your skill level rather than actually. So that later well, I can reuse the process

Speaker 1  38:50
through ongoing boasted this will I guess most will go up? I guess the there's three different Yeah, the burglar management invoice for the time being will still be handled on the backside. So having some tool there would be would have some value. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  39:15
But what I would gently plead with you guys for is something along the lines of the payroll module where you have an invoice template on the front side. Or second tab is the pretty invoice and the first tab is the import that goes in and you just use the standard import then to pull it in.

Speaker 1  39:37
You mean what you're saying is create a template on our side, similar to payroll module so that DRO can just run the import. Yeah. Well, I mean, that's okay. If it makes more sense for me to Like I could, I could easily turn the file I sent you turn that into the import that you run by. But what we've done there, we have no

Speaker 3  40:15
existing transactions, right? And we're just writing transactions. In that case here we're modifying, at least most of them and ongoing will be we're modifying vendor invoices.

Matthias Miller  40:28
We're going forward.

Speaker 1  40:30
Going forward, if we have a template, there's no reason why we can get an invoice and drop it and turn around immediately push it in. Well, okay, that doesn't create a vendor invoice. Right. And moving forward, we want to create a vendor. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  40:47
yeah.

Matthias Miller  40:56
But if you it moving forward, I guess what I'm trying to, I'm fine using this. This Frankenstein monster for fixing up the old ones? That's fine. I think going forward. I would really like to, I don't personally think that's appropriate for going forward going forward, I would rather see us come up with some kind of vendor invoice import, where it's formatted nicely, if you're going to be pulling this in as a you guys are gonna be pulling this in as a certain let me let me back up a little business context, I'm assuming part of the issue is, you really don't want to expose salaries to people in AP.

Unknown Speaker  41:48
That that's the bottom line. Yeah,

Speaker 3  41:50
that's why it's not coming. That's why AP is not enjoyable. Right? Correct.

Speaker 1  41:54
Now, they, they are now at a point where the invoice is generic enough that we could convince them to just run them through like it's no longer broken out. You know, individual salaries, he's just saying AP is this much AR is this much. So rather than think creating a big rather than spending much time on development, I propose we just have them start to run those through AP as well. So get these fixed up, and then moving forward, just run everything through AP. I mean, I think long term, everyone would be happiest with that.

Matthias Miller  42:38
Okay, well, there's a way that you can protect people's dignity and privacy and do that. I would be a fan of that. centralize the process. I don't mind. I don't mind getting creative in our inventions to make this work. I am a little leery of. If Dwayne can come up with if Dwayne, you can build a report like this that does what you need and he's able to support it. That's one thing but I feel like this is so edge case and unusual that to support it long term is

Speaker 1  43:15
no, I think that's let's plan to do that moving forward. We'll just process them through me. Until we get switched over, we might have one or two drew where to do some manual work, but that's okay. If I guess what all we need from humans eyes on this then is help on cleaning up this what has already been entered?

Matthias Miller  43:39
Well, I can Okay, I can clean up my husband hit enter Do you want me to. And then and then anything that has not been entered, you will find a way to run through AP and get them to enter it.

Speaker 1  44:01
On the files I sent to you, what we're sending to you to clean up everything should be entered already. Got

Matthias Miller  44:10
it. So I just go through the files fix up. He's come up with a magic tool to help me fix things up. And we that's cool. So Ben, don't worry about it. I will figure it out. And if I have a way that it makes sense for me to hand it off to you maybe maybe we'll take a look at that but otherwise well.

Speaker 1  44:27
So Matthias you should have two of the three files now you should have for color management Burpo employment agency and then I will get Burkholder transport to you later today yet as well. Sounds good.

Speaker 3  44:45
All good. With the solution you're

Speaker 1  44:49
proposing. What are you expecting? Completion by

Matthias Miller  44:55
I mean I'm I'm hopeful. I don't know what else I've got coming my way. But depending how many what else I've got to chase down and I'm hopeful

Unknown Speaker  45:05
we can get it done by today some time

Matthias Miller  45:13
at number we're waiting for you on Drew. I mean, we ran that report you got what

Unknown Speaker  45:19
you need for now. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  45:20
I think I got what I need. So you believe you have

Unknown Speaker  45:22
that AP number we can get

Speaker 3  45:26
when we need a witness to add that that one transaction

Speaker 1  45:31
of 23 So so what what are we still missing for final numbers for Whitney?

Speaker 3  45:38
M? AP and those couple bank discover expenses

Speaker 1  45:43
but like receive now voucher, there's nothing we need. Matthias on that like I know that that was one account. That was one

Speaker 3  45:52
number there might be way oh, oh, yeah, we should look at that one.

Unknown Speaker  46:04
Received Oh, we had given her

Unknown Speaker  46:11
we given her something we had given her.

Speaker 1  46:15
Well, whatever I wrote down 20,024. No, 23 23,000. Do we want to look at that with Matthias as well.

Speaker 3  46:30
So so so our number here would be a number that would have changed due to something as well. All right. Is there a

Unknown Speaker  46:42
point three to

Speaker 3  46:43
about $18,000. I wonder what's that arrowhead? That arrowhead invoice?

Matthias Miller  46:54
Wait, is this still an AP? No,

Speaker 3  46:56
we're talking about receiving that voucher aren't okay.

Speaker 1  47:04
But it will be pretty much it? Would it be the same criteria as AP or all?

Speaker 3  47:12
Yeah, yeah, it would be in receiving that voucher and before and so it'd be received but not invoiced? Or not. Whatever you call

Matthias Miller  47:26
so it would be but we're looking at the

Unknown Speaker  47:30
here via

Matthias Miller  47:34
Yep. It's a purchase order.

Speaker 2  47:39
And the be in Pio de Pio reception date is and there's an easier way to do this or envy. If it's

Matthias Miller  48:01
a right but you can have I mean, we couldn't couldn't it be wouldn't it be faster let me try this. What's the only job the r&d account number?

Speaker 1  48:13
Yeah, it's 2010 154 then received not but yeah, yep. All

Unknown Speaker  48:25
right. So let's do this. And let's do

Matthias Miller  48:34
it let's just make sure that okay, but the point is you're wanting to verify this against

Matthias Miller  48:48
you're wanting to verify this against a like

Unknown Speaker  48:53
an official number

Speaker 3  48:59
so what's the same kind of case it's pretty sure we came up with the with the actual numbers supposed to be before ready but we there's a shift in the numbers so we're just trying to figure out where that what that came from.

Speaker 1  49:15
Well, this is and we are coming up with the actual number it's not like QuickBooks has no idea what receiving that

Matthias Miller  49:23
looked at so right back to and then well let's start with this and

Speaker 3  49:40
yeah, it's the right amount I'm pretty sure that's

Unknown Speaker  49:44
that's what once you mean

Speaker 3  49:47
you know your something rings a bell

Unknown Speaker  49:51
you know your must be close if

Unknown Speaker  49:59
in they'll just make

Unknown Speaker  50:08
sure sure sure Picky picky how that plays the feel of 16 pieces

Matthias Miller  50:16
I'm not sure if I did this right know I didn't do it right because the and the

Unknown Speaker  50:27
how do we

Matthias Miller  50:30
account for

Speaker 2  50:33
account put on 16 rNv skews and so

Matthias Miller  50:44
what if we did the

Matthias Miller  50:51
new macro

Speaker 2  50:53
skews and mounts it done paid with during table to column where to list some it was some look at total and is an error zero and then this one should be not the PIO total but the RME total because

Matthias Miller  51:37
don't know what What number are you looking for

Unknown Speaker  51:42
18,570

Matthias Miller  51:44
Oh

Unknown Speaker  51:47
that was an invoice no or I mean it was a Pio total is that is that today well I should just

Matthias Miller  51:57
say are you expecting that to be that would to be an r&b Are you looking for another invoice total?

Speaker 3  52:05
Um Well I think what it is is it used to be an r&b and then we kicked it out

Matthias Miller  52:16
there let's go back to this guy would 18 one to 548

Speaker 3  52:24
what 16 Eight is our difference so maybe there's something else involved

Matthias Miller  52:36
but we didn't we also have

Speaker 3  52:45
so that thing shouldn't be in accounts payable the one that I'm thinking of? Actually no, it should not even be in accounts payable it should be totally, totally done in 23

Unknown Speaker  53:00
Do you

Unknown Speaker  53:02
want to know

Matthias Miller  53:04
do you expect r&b to be 1.4 million No, no,

Unknown Speaker  53:10
not even close.

Matthias Miller  53:11
So there's so there's clearly some kind of problem in my in the reception date is.

Speaker 2  53:24
RMB total Pio accounting apparently skews and amounts

Matthias Miller  53:34
so what am i right but this doesn't account for psi of course it doesn't right. That's that's everything that had gone into it. But invoice accounting the count impact and here we are.

Speaker 2  53:54
RnB impact company impact vi vs RMB account or I'd be

Speaker 2  54:12
r&d amounts in cat Purchase Order field okay, but then this is based on the effective date on these transactions are on the we invoice invoice date and so the

Speaker 1  54:43
true would it be? I mean, would it be correct to say that we want this report the criteria should be anything that was received not vouchered as of 1231 and has since moved out of receipt not vouchers. You know as of 424 as of today is basically we're saying anything that that wasn't received that voucher 1231 and has not moved out is legit

Speaker 3  55:16
I think this might be yeah we were looking at what has moved out you know through a canceled to having

Speaker 1  55:22
10 That matches exactly okay no not quite close to what we had

Matthias Miller  55:32
How much is it off

Speaker 3  55:35
what we've given 280 bucks

Speaker 1  55:38
yeah what we had was 23 zero to 420

Matthias Miller  55:53
Sorry you had the number you had was how much

Speaker 3  55:55
so 23 02 450 cents

Speaker 2  55:59
we would still have a field on so we are higher might

Speaker 1  56:06
be higher it's there in the middle of night this guy actually yeah why was that not in

Matthias Miller  56:19
your well let's take a look so

Unknown Speaker  56:21
Oh 416 Somebody made it

Matthias Miller  56:24
wrong Josh SKU let creation version register with that was

Speaker 1  56:33
but that skew like creation Wow.

Matthias Miller  56:38
The reception is 26 where somebody could also change the

Unknown Speaker  56:43
system the invoice there's a one three invoice modification history

Speaker 3  56:51
was was the whole were all those videos connected to where they all from 23

Unknown Speaker  57:01
to the invoice Yeah. Yeah. There.

Matthias Miller  57:08
Yeah, it's all the same Pio?

Speaker 2  57:10
Yeah. This is all the same. I don't see a beat. Let's see.

Speaker 3  57:18
Well, I mean, it looks like by all appearances that should be in received not vouchers updated

Matthias Miller  57:24
invoice over with the practice? Yeah, I mean, it does. So I'm sure it doesn't explain why it hadn't been.

Unknown Speaker  57:33
What is your balance sheet not matched this

Matthias Miller  57:37
we've avoided this let's see when we've waited we used to be an r&b and then I'll bet you I've waited it to get raw materials or something or I don't know was they trying to match raw materials at all?

Speaker 1  57:57
Not the 1005 You shouldn't have been because that drew just makes or makes a journal entry on that one right.

Unknown Speaker  58:10
Pure accounting impact

Unknown Speaker  58:12
or if there was

Matthias Miller  58:17
Yeah, I mean, so this one

Unknown Speaker  58:19
your three to six

Matthias Miller  58:23
this one does not have a transaction associated with with it for some reason I avoided it back though this is back in January

Speaker 1  58:37
avoid it like you for AR and the undeposited funds some of those accounts you avoided a whole bunch of transactions that would know that wouldn't know

Matthias Miller  58:50
we've got an account issue here that's why I'm

Unknown Speaker  58:55
so it's just not posting

Matthias Miller  58:58
it's just not posting so maybe we can

Unknown Speaker  59:04
wait a minute Oh, she

Unknown Speaker  59:05
does all or doesn't match this

Matthias Miller  59:09
Yeah, pure accounting and let's go see what what you do and get out Yeah, like there's no so these skews here are no longer active? And I'll bet they don't. Okay, let's go over to the

Unknown Speaker  59:33
All right. So let's let's do this. We will find you you can run but you cannot hide.

Matthias Miller  59:42
All right. So 6940

Unknown Speaker  59:45
No.

Matthias Miller  59:50
Okay, let's let's do the

Unknown Speaker  1:00:01
skew

Unknown Speaker  1:00:05
what's exciting

Unknown Speaker  1:00:12
what

Matthias Miller  1:00:17
All right, come on what is going on

Speaker 1  1:00:22
with this? I wonder if this SKU was inactivated for some reason is that what it could? What it looks like?

Matthias Miller  1:00:29
Here let's see if yes there we go here we go now we found them all right

Unknown Speaker  1:00:37
enact inactive for some reason

Speaker 1  1:00:39
well I think this is what is it antique bronze?

Unknown Speaker  1:00:43
Yeah

Speaker 1  1:00:48
Or did we inactivate all antique bronze us I think everything to gray slate year

Speaker 3  1:01:01
so how many ABC ones mostly they're counting how many ABC and shutdown ones do we have that aren't posting to accounting and therefore we have it wrong

Matthias Miller  1:01:16
active SKU string Yeah, we're only posting this is the problem

Matthias Miller  1:01:25
we're only posting if it's active if the which means that if you deactivate you're going to lose all your POS earlier in the year. That's probably not good. I'm just

Unknown Speaker  1:01:39
not good.

Matthias Miller  1:01:42
Let's see if let me see if I can get this to do to you because

Speaker 3  1:01:48
we built everything on accounting like our numbers or numbers or went from what was in accounting as of well 31 And then compared to what was in there as a no like March sometime you know and then we we said okay, the ones that are still in Yeah, probably are just invalid and so we journal those out. So we're basing everything on accounting if a if a Pio wasn't posting because of missing transactions then no I don't think it's gonna matter we're gonna I think we're gonna catch it in like AP is because AP would have paid for it anyway. So posted

Unknown Speaker  1:02:37
Josh, okay,

Matthias Miller  1:02:39
well active

Speaker 2  1:02:44
Okay, let's do the skew on the x plane field. Sky straight skew active skews you ski ski ski ski seats Okay, that's what I'm looking for. I'm looking for excuse

Unknown Speaker  1:03:01
the existing schema

Speaker 2  1:03:04
not to be confused with the grain that people eat for breakfast sometimes

Unknown Speaker  1:03:12
we might have had those fun but it's so big

Matthias Miller  1:03:17
but once a

Unknown Speaker  1:03:20
yah yah yah yah

Matthias Miller  1:03:24
very small All right. So then fear All right, here's where we get to have some fun

Speaker 2  1:03:35
count impact changes vo po accounted vaccine to sorry, you are now going to become

Matthias Miller  1:03:45
this is such a message just about drives me crazy. But anyway, this is now live for 25 version of the account impact changes. Alright, so the old one is the PIO the new one is

Speaker 2  1:04:05
Pio account Pio account impact in we our purchase orders. Yeah, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:16
And then we need

Speaker 2  1:04:18
P O skew fin account name needs to be customized the macro po this guy or this guy? This guy

Unknown Speaker  1:04:41
All right. Let's see

Speaker 1  1:05:32
Did we plan for our three o'clock call this afternoon just to catch up on anything that turns up through probably

Matthias Miller  1:05:44
got a pretty flexible schedule up until about four o'clock today so

Matthias Miller  1:05:53
well come on little buddy

Unknown Speaker  1:06:00
said it was going to be slow they weren't joking

Matthias Miller  1:06:06
how many

Matthias Miller  1:06:22
Well, this really should get pushed out. Yeah, here we go here they're coming these reliefs you get pushed out into

Matthias Miller  1:06:41
don't care if RMB numbers shift for 2024

Speaker 1  1:06:54
Well, we you're saying we determine what starting number is for January one but do we care if the if they shift in throughout the year and 24 Oh, I mean we want them to reflect accurately on the balance sheet but they're like they're going to when you say they they're going to ship them entering r&b won't change will it

Matthias Miller  1:07:26
we're currently currently You're right. We won't create we will enter the r&b We won't exit no it'll try to exit it'll exit r&b So your r&b is going to be after you pay your invoice after you get your invoice r&b is going to be lower than you should and then if we make this fix and run but if we run an update tonight then doesn't matter we'll get it done before the before

Speaker 2  1:07:58
we push numbers out but it's

Matthias Miller  1:08:06
like here's one

Matthias Miller  1:08:16
here's one where we we now have the account

Unknown Speaker  1:08:21
there's the

Matthias Miller  1:08:27
but here's one we're still missing the account

Unknown Speaker  1:08:32
so this one is

Matthias Miller  1:08:42
builder payment links to this guy

Unknown Speaker  1:08:48
which doesn't have a place to go on the balance sheet

Matthias Miller  1:09:06
so there are a bunch of I

Unknown Speaker  1:09:09
should have put reception date on here. Okay, let's keep going down down down down, okay within these are resolved.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:18
How can you tell if that result?

Matthias Miller  1:09:22
The okay this is the this is the old accounting impact versus the old accounting impact errors. This is the old accounting impact amount.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:32
Some kind not sure where the amount is coming from.

Matthias Miller  1:09:36
This is the new new accounting impact new errors new amount. So here's the error went away. These work before still work. These didn't work before or after. And then here we see these starting to work

Unknown Speaker  1:09:52
again. So it didn't

Speaker 3  1:09:59
buy it, since we are not pushing back in 23, it didn't actually update the number the way it's supposed to we just don't have the error.

Matthias Miller  1:10:11
Well, yeah, any of these 23 Well, these still aren't pushing correctly, we need to go fix,

Speaker 2  1:10:17
I mean, make it be able to find the right account,

Matthias Miller  1:10:21
but we could we could do a one off, I guess what I'm trying to say is we could do a one off process for 23 and create the transactions that we can for 23 Now for these guys, where you're on the I mean, we've got these miscellaneous items that are RMB that we can't do anything with and your RMB numbers going to be off

Unknown Speaker  1:10:47
because

Matthias Miller  1:10:52
we can't create the we can't increase r&d But then the vendor invoice decreases RMB because they thought Pio was handled. So these are going to all of these I think

Speaker 2  1:11:09
these are all zero amount, right? On the wire. That doesn't make sense.

Speaker 3  1:11:19
Well, the accounting impact is zero. So it's we have an error

Matthias Miller  1:11:26
that's right, this must be the actual accounting

Unknown Speaker  1:11:29
impact from accounting

Speaker 1  1:11:34
so receive not voucher because of this mistake, we probably have a much too low receive not Voucher number at the end 23 Which

Speaker 3  1:11:45
does does that then mean that our how does that affect Accounts Payable then? Because as soon as you know would the vendor invoices connected to one of these that didn't push over? If that would have connected Okay, where like it would have affected accounts receivable I mean it would affected r&d should have

Matthias Miller  1:12:15
so what's happening is we never increase r&b But when we get the invoice we so we never increase r&b Then we decrease r&b and increase AP and then once we pay with DP SAP and decrease checking you know whatever

Unknown Speaker  1:12:29
however that works. So

Unknown Speaker  1:12:30
AP is not affected by this no fake but RMB is so what happened because of this is we had only for four inactive skews. We had an r&b number that was was likely too low at the end of the year. Which I think decreases our

Unknown Speaker  1:13:00
crop. Look, it's

Matthias Miller  1:13:04
it's only r&b where it's actually the only the only problem is if it entered r&b And there was invoice before the end of the year. You're discrepant, that's that's the discrepancy. Now if it enters rNv and you don't invoice and 23 into sorry to invoice until 24th and 24 You're going to start seeing a too low r&b Number

Speaker 1  1:13:30
You're saying the only ones that affect 23 Are they would have had to oh because they entered r&b And it didn't increase but then because we always do they decrease right

Speaker 3  1:13:55
well, where does she get her RMD numbers from does she just does he just take it out of accounts payable or that journal entry?

Speaker 1  1:14:09
No, she she does QuickBooks doesn't know about r&b She just says I make a journal entry for the materials you tell me you have and that okay, the end of the year that we said here's the materials we have, here's how much AP we have. Here's how much r&b We have. And so she said okay, the r&b make a journal entry for 20,000 on r&b which

Unknown Speaker  1:14:40
we're sure getting it from

Unknown Speaker  1:14:43
we want it from us teachers yeah

Speaker 3  1:14:45
know what I mean the journal entry what's the other side? Is that AP or is that inventory?

Speaker 1  1:14:55
No, because we gave her the inventory now under the AP number they are unbeaten. Number We just think we said the other side of the debit, or the other side of the transaction is. So up until now we had never had r&b, which was kind of odd. So we said, January 120 23, you had no r&b Now it's gone up 20,000. So that means you by the way she does starting and ending balances, I think she increased cost of goods

Unknown Speaker  1:15:31
by that amount

Speaker 1  1:15:34
she would actually that would it would lower? Well, it would lower profits for 23. by that amount. I mean, what I'd like to see is how much okay with vinyl, we still we can make this direction because we haven't finalized. And if your numbers, the other two, I'd like to see how much how much data are monitored, we talking if we're talking, you know, less than $2,000. And I say we just disregard keep moving. I mean, it's, there's nothing will be affected by that.

Speaker 3  1:16:14
Basically, we just take the amount there, change our journal entry in RMB. So that we still match the number that we gave for

Speaker 1  1:16:23
and move on or not? Well, but if we change our journal entry, but But how, how are you determining what's keeping? Like if you go to if you go to your 1231 balance sheet for shared time, one that's already been done. And you go to the General Ledger on received that voucher, what? What are you showing there is it just you just journal, or event we

Speaker 3  1:16:53
journaled out everything that was invalid, like it was only one side of the transaction for some reason. So which means we would have journal out the invoices for a bunch of these guys. Because those will be one side of transactions

Speaker 1  1:17:08
shouldn't have any sorry, he would have specific, you only have the specific purchase orders that we said were legit at that point.

Speaker 3  1:17:20
That went in before, out after. And then anything that we don't have in and out. We said there's not even there's not a valid RnB transaction. So all these invoices that are connected to these guys, we would have journaled out. So we need to take them out of our journal entry again. Because Because now it's going in, so now that's the ones that are invoiced before 2023.

Speaker 1  1:17:58
And we've had two been received and 23. invoiced in 23. And having invalid. Okay,

Speaker 3  1:18:05
so the only change to the rNv ending number is going to be these guys that are connected to invoices that are invoiced in 24.

Speaker 1  1:18:17
Oh, yeah, it would have they would have to be invoiced in 24. That's otherwise they would have left r&b And we don't care. So yeah, that's what we'd want to see is what was received in 23. Purchase orders received in 23.

Speaker 1  1:18:38
Don't know, could we go back to your report that you had Matthias, the earlier one where we like where you showed just simplistic r&b? Like, where we saw that 23,000 or whatever it was? And just add, I don't know and a column? Yeah, this one, could we add a column that says

Unknown Speaker  1:19:02
basically, if you have an inactive SKU, or list if you haven't, a SKU that has been activated or maybe it's maybe the right thing to say is if the accounting impact is

Speaker 1  1:19:19
if the accounting impact is different than the purchase order total is really what we want to see. I think

Unknown Speaker  1:19:27
right?

Matthias Miller  1:19:29
That would be a fairly easy way to do it. Let's just do

Unknown Speaker  1:19:34
trends.

Unknown Speaker  1:19:39
And really not think it's going to be

Speaker 3  1:19:45
well remember just doesn't match because we'd have to leave it

Speaker 1  1:19:51
we have to leave it but we still have to deal with it at some point.

Matthias Miller  1:19:57
In some ways, it'd be nice to just like think He's like account balance agnostic and other things like that it

Unknown Speaker  1:20:02
might be nice to actually just go back and create these transactions historically

Unknown Speaker  1:20:14
which is super is purchase the current then we will do in string list there are definitely times when I think this stuff should be less complicated.

Speaker 2  1:20:34
Plus been stirring po ID for a spin stirring and egg for some RG account transplant we're gonna do it in the x in the x

Unknown Speaker  1:20:56
the one that the heck out

Unknown Speaker  1:20:59
three to six.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:12
Field All right, if it's Pio event,

Speaker 3  1:21:18
yeah, well is the only one because that was a report of the IMS r&b. And that was the only difference between what accounting said

Matthias Miller  1:21:31
Yeah, good point.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:34
That's exactly what I'm seeing here.

Speaker 1  1:21:36
Well, if we do this for the other two companies, we could we could see where we're at. And I think this one, we should just fix it. Because we still have numbers that we're gonna go back to it ever change? And then that way, it'll come out of r&d properly and 20. But that won't be that won't affect any expenses the or will have well, yeah, that would. So this expense never posted to the

Matthias Miller  1:22:07
ramen, this is the only my reports, right? This is the only transaction across all companies that have this issue.

Speaker 1  1:22:14
Okay, now? Well, then I think we should just fix that. But then I'm curious, how far off are we in? Like, one 124 today? Because, okay, if you if you when you apply your raw materials that would come into play, when you acquire actual raw material source that would come into play.

Speaker 3  1:22:38
Because it gets expanded once we get to the invoice. No,

Speaker 1  1:22:41
it gets expensed based on when the product is received. But are we pushing like on this one, this 382 60 that expands? Never posted to accounting credit.

Matthias Miller  1:22:55
Correct. Which means that any of these that we have in 24, your your cost numbers are going to be off

Speaker 1  1:23:10
well, this is better than not knowing it's what you don't. That hurts you.

Matthias Miller  1:23:15
That's true. All right. Let me make a note of myself.

Unknown Speaker  1:23:20
Not hot, guys.

Unknown Speaker  1:23:24
That's it. We're on the other side of that.

Speaker 2  1:23:27
That's yeah, okay. Create counting impacts transaction.

Matthias Miller  1:23:38
Plus, okay, so going into 2024? Can I change the accounting impact logic? And have it go create these transactions over the weekend? Or is that going to create chaos for you guys?

Speaker 3  1:23:56
You mean, if you back it up to him for? Well, 23

Matthias Miller  1:24:02
No, we do. I'll manually fixed 23 And then 24 would get fixed over the weekend, which means that your your assets are going to shift in your own view is going to

Unknown Speaker  1:24:13
shift in 2424.

Unknown Speaker  1:24:17
Yeah, no, that's fine.

Speaker 1  1:24:19
But but I'm suspicious that that we won't even have any in 24 Like could you just change the date range on that? Report and

Matthias Miller  1:24:27
let's well, except it's okay, so if look r&b total. So it would be

Unknown Speaker  1:24:42
like this guy let's do let's do it's let's just do this.

Unknown Speaker  1:24:52
I think it might be the only one you have to change.

Unknown Speaker  1:24:55
Yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:24:59
All right. Let's take a look at these okay here's one well but maybe this one literally is

Unknown Speaker  1:25:06
just not invoice yet actually

Matthias Miller  1:25:12
no but this one has

Speaker 2  1:25:17
storage unit anchors so let's go into skews come on so this one is active Cost of Goods Sold sheds

Matthias Miller  1:25:44
oh that's a good point wherever this is from today

Unknown Speaker  1:25:48
nevermind we're no

Speaker 1  1:25:53
wait what you still have an accounting impact when it's received but this

Speaker 3  1:25:57
well but if that's today it hasn't pushed over yet.

Speaker 1  1:26:00
Oh yeah. What happens tonight? I can live and write

Matthias Miller  1:26:05
this was what is this date? Was this literally entered 25th It was excellent. Yeah, today alright, so ship time. Let's go ship time shutdowns good mental structures is not good

Unknown Speaker  1:26:28
let's do this.

Speaker 1  1:26:30
What I'm thinking is it appears to be so minimal that we can fix manually fix these few transactions and keep going with work like nothing needs to wait for the Weekend Update then and still do the weekend update that way you're not stuck with like applying actual boss and

Matthias Miller  1:26:54
I get what you're after.

Unknown Speaker  1:26:58
Okay, you're What don't you like about that? I gave it to you. Okay, so let's try this decimals please. And fine, good enough. All right. So let's go down to vital structures

Speaker 2  1:27:27
actually, sorry one more thing. Some commas and make it go right

Matthias Miller  1:27:39
there was one up here

Unknown Speaker  1:27:43
1720

Unknown Speaker  1:27:45
They were like part of the PIO is it looks

Speaker 2  1:27:48
like yeah, part of the part of the POS networking kit

Matthias Miller  1:27:52
there's zero years one

Speaker 1  1:27:57
other last that's the total there's only one there so

Matthias Miller  1:28:03
it's just it is you're right it is literally a handful

Unknown Speaker  1:28:11
and so we should actually for the sake of this we could actually do and not is an error zero oops and here's this should theoretically be all the problem ones Yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:28:38
So that was one of them last year. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:28:40
And one of them was today.

Matthias Miller  1:28:44
Well right and one of them was today so it's one last year into this year

Speaker 1  1:28:51
though is that something that with if you can just fix those transactions on your site and and then make the updates Yep. So now the logic you're going to what you're going to do moving forward is even if the SKU is inactive still have an impact accounting just like you would for an active SKU. Great.

Matthias Miller  1:29:27
Perfect, good.

Speaker 1  1:29:28
So does that give you the the number four received not okay. For no numbers, affordable and said time received not voucher does not change for last year. For vinyl, it increases three to 60 Right.

Speaker 3  1:29:53
So we should now be 1234

Speaker 4  1:30:00
Just go plus 20 302-450-3407 10.

Speaker 1  1:30:05
Which as soon as the five makes that changes that transaction. So we'll put there, then you

Unknown Speaker  1:30:17
may need to make a journal entry change from this 60 to 100. to that.

Speaker 1  1:30:27
Because this is what we're currently showing you journal out a number of.

Speaker 3  1:30:31
Yeah, there must have been Yeah, we journal out 259,000.

Speaker 1  1:30:38
Oh, that's your so how are you going to get back to this

Speaker 3  1:30:41
useless term? Like, so there were legitimate changes happened since this because of stuff we found or something.

Speaker 1  1:30:54
Oh, but you're, you're not journaling out specific purchase orders, then. You're just making a lump sum. Yeah, this was but But starting at 24, then receive nine vouchers. If you go into the the general ledger, you'll still have a whole load of must be

Unknown Speaker  1:31:17
resolved should be

Unknown Speaker  1:31:20
given only got what

Speaker 3  1:31:24
this will be. This will be the balance. And then like as this journal entry is just to offset illegitimate stuff, that's 23 407 is what is legitimate math what we had come up with back then it's just new things hid there that are also illegitimate. So we have to, so we have to fix

Speaker 1  1:31:55
our journal entry. But what keeps those are the ones that are not legitimate from showing up when you go into the general ledger of liking 24?

Speaker 3  1:32:05
I mean, if you would go into the ledger and back into 23. Yeah, then you

Speaker 1  1:32:09
would see it. Oh, funny. Okay, in really good respects dates, so that's good. So you're you have all the numbers you need from the virus then for vinyl. It's just those bank bank accounts, your bank and credit card accounts that were still missing, right?

Unknown Speaker  1:32:32
The mean is

Unknown Speaker  1:32:36
that you still need.

Speaker 3  1:32:38
Yeah, I just had to figure out what, like this one here.

Unknown Speaker  1:32:42
What you're different from Whitney.

Speaker 3  1:32:46
Yeah, I think I think it's just because someone's posted the wrong account, because this is what it should be. Like, I already know that. Because it's, that's the one we don't use anymore. I mean, there was a credit on it. And Lowe's card is anybody's guess.

Speaker 1  1:33:05
Good. Okay. Well, I think for Matthias, unless you have questions for me there. I think that's more straightforward.

Matthias Miller  1:33:17
One quick question. Fixing accounting impact or getting Burkholder imported which one's priority?

Speaker 3  1:33:27
Fixing accounting impact? I mean, you're saying the the the update you want to run this weekend? Are you saying no, I

Matthias Miller  1:33:35
mean, the fixing fixing those three transactions?

Speaker 3  1:33:39
Oh, yeah, I would do that first because that that one affects our balance sheet for 1230

Matthias Miller  1:33:47
Perfect. Figured we want to make sure yes, those are easy report. I got what we need here.

Speaker 1  1:33:54
Reports been sent me some, the only thing that I would want to change is you could set those as Excel instead of PDFs, but sure. I looked at it briefly, but I haven't seen anything that Do you have any questions for me on those? Or did it make it all make sense?

Speaker 4  1:34:17
Um, the only thing I was you had asked for FGI calculations, and we have a handful of different FGI reports but none of the state calculations I wasn't exactly sure what you're looking for on that. Oh,

Matthias Miller  1:34:36
well, don't assume that it's the right one.

Speaker 1  1:34:42
That's it's the one that if income shows turn 50,000 Like revenues, then this breaks down the invoices that make up that tuna food recall. I think we call it FTA calculations, but maybe it was renamed Not sure.

Speaker 3  1:35:01
Sales or FDI calculations maybe

Unknown Speaker  1:35:05
that's it

Unknown Speaker  1:35:09
might just be Oh 411 is the date on

Speaker 2  1:35:15
for lab and you're building during 10 Okay oh four

Unknown Speaker  1:35:21
yeah that's it. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:35:24
Oh 411 FTA

Matthias Miller  1:35:26
calculations by so yeah um do we want this as this how many of these are one off reports and how many of these should be a less other

Unknown Speaker  1:35:41
side of first

Unknown Speaker  1:35:45
what we keep using the standard

Matthias Miller  1:35:49
Alright, so then there's the this is for the FDI calculations and then the built buildings

Speaker 4  1:35:59
just tried to merge the three company or the three what do they call because

Matthias Miller  1:36:11
did we have a Mark did we have a custom report that we built for that?

Speaker 1  1:36:17
Yeah, you I think that was one of the last ones you you built in the intent was so that we could use it when applying actual costs to see what standard costs were and then is that

Speaker 3  1:36:31
the quarry lab and raw materials for period

Matthias Miller  1:36:36
there we go. Such wonderful names okay. And then you wanted to be able to run these all in a single report

Unknown Speaker  1:36:45
like all raw materials consumed

Speaker 2  1:36:50
Wait, is the wrong materials rubbish bins consumed, though it actually makes sense. I also misspelled district just for fun.

Matthias Miller  1:37:00
Do you do you do you want the Okay, this is the built buildings. This is what you're considering the built buildings report right?

Speaker 1  1:37:13
Yeah, yeah. Should have everything. Yeah, yep.

Matthias Miller  1:37:18
And then you can

Speaker 2  1:37:21
I mean, yeah. But I think you can just split this out into

Matthias Miller  1:37:27
just three separate it's by district and so it's Indiana and Ohio instead

Unknown Speaker  1:37:33
of how Okay,

Speaker 1  1:37:35
and we can't combine New York and Ohio right

Matthias Miller  1:37:41
well, let's go take a look and see it might actually make

Unknown Speaker  1:37:50
let's try New York.

Matthias Miller  1:37:52
Like there isn't it isn't showing anything in New York I'm pretty sure we're filtering

Unknown Speaker  1:37:56
building expressions in our light.

Unknown Speaker  1:38:01
Okay, New York that

Unknown Speaker  1:38:05
I think's

Matthias Miller  1:38:07
building builder district Do you guys have have nears

Unknown Speaker  1:38:13
pulling standard

Matthias Miller  1:38:20
I mean, is that the right thing to do?

Speaker 1  1:38:22
I think so. Yeah. Because we're slowly working toward eliminating that district moving stuff over into the ideas

Unknown Speaker  1:38:31
okay all right. So then this is the buildings built report it's called

Matthias Miller  1:38:47
basal fires for right now so yeah, exactly. It's leaking speaking make the connection to which is which is about itself. Alright, so Ben, does that give you then what you need on those

Unknown Speaker  1:38:57
guys?

Speaker 4  1:38:57
Yeah, I think so. So these since they're by district there's going to be other builders in there besides just affordable barn.

Matthias Miller  1:39:10
No, let me give you like, like the FGI

Speaker 4  1:39:13
has affordable barn and pleasant valley structures pushed in together

Matthias Miller  1:39:20
so the district board Okay, affordable barn there is a the legal entity name is affordable barn. But there are other builders and affordable barn is a builder as well. But there are other builders that build for affordable barn. And and then let me send you the mapping of so there's the mapping of state of companies that kind of companies and districts just for your reference, so Okay, ABCs Ohio rental

Speaker 2  1:39:51
structures, North Carolina and shutdowns. Gotcha. Okay. And then New York you can ignore Okay. Cool. Good, good. Yeah. Those are

Unknown Speaker  1:40:06
two you probably hear by two o'clock Eastern. Hopefully.

Speaker 1  1:40:13
That should be good. And probably as we make updates throughout the next day or week, probably, yeah. I'll be reaching out to you periodically for updated reports. On some of these just, yeah. Good. Well, I think we've made a lot of good progress. We'll see where we're at. Yeah, buy three and go from there.

Unknown Speaker  1:40:41
I love it. Thanks.

Unknown Speaker  1:40:42
Thank you.
