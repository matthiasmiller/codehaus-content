Unknown Speaker  01:21
Good Morning, Mark,

Speaker 1  01:24
it's been a while since we've talked or seems like it,

Matthias Miller  01:28
it seems like it.

Unknown Speaker  01:30
Yeah, so how have you been? I've

Unknown Speaker  01:34
been pretty good.

Matthias Miller  01:35
We spent last weekend in Kansas for our family to get together.

Unknown Speaker  01:43
So

Matthias Miller  01:47
yeah, my mom turned 80 in July, and we made that the reason, and then we came home when we realized we never staying happy birthday or did anything like that. So

Speaker 1  02:02
yeah, yeah. So you, you, you just missed Josh. Then it was, was Josh there while you were there,

Matthias Miller  02:08
um, he was at the beginning of the week. I don't remember when he came back. We might have, we might have crossed paths a bit, but I'm not sure.

Unknown Speaker  02:16
Okay, yeah,

Speaker 1  02:23
well, it sounds like it's, it'll be just the two of us on the call today, right? And it Drew. Drew won't be on someone Joel or or Audra joining

Matthias Miller  02:42
Audra. Will join in an hour, and Joel will not join. I got, I got an update from him on

Speaker 2  02:54
on what I need to know there. So, okay, yeah, I

Speaker 1  03:03
much good. Well, I send you an agenda with what I had on my my list, but, man, to get it out earlier. Chance look at it, but I'd say, yeah, go ahead with what you've got there.

Unknown Speaker  03:18
Sure. I

Unknown Speaker  03:23
yeah, I

Unknown Speaker  03:27
think every, I mean, I think what's what I've got is covered here.

Matthias Miller  03:31
So we'll just go through that. One, a, got it makes sense. 1b, not yet. It was too short of a time frame for Seth to get it done. He sent me an email this morning that he's got the coding mostly done for this, and there's some

Unknown Speaker  03:53
let's see, he had put together a report that shows

Matthias Miller  04:01
how his changes are impacting,

Unknown Speaker  04:07
accounting impact.

Unknown Speaker  04:16
Let me see if might

Matthias Miller  04:22
be able to have this run in the background and be able to circle back and talk through what, what it wants to have happen.

Unknown Speaker  04:35
We're actually a bet.

Unknown Speaker  04:42
Let's actually do this range

Unknown Speaker  04:57
search. G bi. Place, none I could. I

Matthias Miller  05:19
could I could put together just a little report here that we could actually take a look at together and see

Matthias Miller  05:37
is the 449 Is that a shed time asset?

Unknown Speaker  05:43
Yes, It is, yep.

Matthias Miller  07:04
Yeah, I don't know that we

Matthias Miller  07:13
I don't know that we're far enough along that we can, I mean, we can kind of preview the transactions that would be created, but it doesn't, but it wouldn't necessarily show, it wouldn't necessarily

Unknown Speaker  07:36
show how asset value is affected.

Speaker 1  07:41
Okay, so the when do you expect those to be? Those changes to be alive or be in the live system should

Unknown Speaker  07:51
go live by Saturday,

Unknown Speaker  07:56
and then that would give us the ability to make a sale on the on the asset.

Unknown Speaker  08:07
Yes. Okay,

Speaker 1  08:09
now the several questions. So we're using this asset management in sort of a modified in a different way than what we intended it to be used initially for for some things like this, these renovation houses. We said, well, that is a lot of ways an asset, so let's use the asset management table. The only thing that will be different is there will be no we'll keep it there while they're working on the house and renovating it, and use it to link all costs, link all invoices to that. You know, you pay a plumber $1,000 to come in and do some work, and you pay electrician to come in and do some work, and link all of those invoices to that. It's the initial purchase of the property, plus all the work that you get outside people to do, plus all the journal entries for work that your dead time employees did to the building. And then you end up with this building cost. Does? We have incurred costs of 160,000 in this asset. And then at that point we make a sale of asset, moving it from an asset to a moving out, moving it out of the making all that those transactions, moving it off of the out of an asset and on to income statement in the non operating section as a I think this one, unfortunately, is going To be a laws on sale of asset, but the Do you see any problems with that not working like we My thought is we would just never put it in service. So my question is, can you make a sale on an asset without ever putting it in service? Is, the reason for not putting it in service is, I don't want it to depreciate because it's it wouldn't appreciate.

Matthias Miller  10:13
Well, I mean, if you don't want it to depreciate, you could also put in the original cost as the salvage value, no, because you have an increase in cost, you could, you could put the salvage value in as you know here, here the cost so far is 159 two or three. And you could put the salvage value in as, like 250 or something. And I think we would be fine then I'm hoping we never do negative depreciation. I'm

Unknown Speaker  10:47
pretty sure we don't,

Matthias Miller  10:51
or you could, yeah, but I think it should be fine never to put it in this Well, let's try it out. Let me open the Test System, and we're going to create, let's see, let's manage assets, and we're going to,

Unknown Speaker  11:10
let's just pull up shed time and see if this one's in here. I'm

Unknown Speaker  11:27
so this one was marked as being put in service. So let me take that off.

Matthias Miller  11:38
We probably what I would do is wait to put it into service until the day you sell or abandon it.

Unknown Speaker  11:51
Asset counts or not, zero, okay,

Matthias Miller  11:57
let me do a new transaction for sale, abandonment impairment,

Unknown Speaker  12:04
actually, maybe, maybe it's better to do that first. Let me try this.

Matthias Miller  12:08
Okay, so in the test system, I changed this one house 449, to go into service today, create a new transaction of the sale. Banterman impairment,

Unknown Speaker  12:23
and

Matthias Miller  12:27
then we have,

Matthias Miller  12:36
we have no accumulated depreciation. And would you want to? Are you going to sell it at this well, then you would

Unknown Speaker  12:51
wait a minute. I'm confused. I

Matthias Miller  13:00
I thought we had a way to say that we're selling it for this amount. Now, go make it all tie out.

Unknown Speaker  13:13
Did we not have that?

Speaker 1  13:16
I was, I mean, I don't know. I was expecting we, we would not I should have gone back and looked at bills document, most recent documentation. I mean, it's been a maybe you did the documentation. Not sure. But,

Matthias Miller  13:42
um, we do have, no, we're just doing it.

Speaker 1  13:56
When you I would think you need have a sale price so that you can

Unknown Speaker  14:10
look at value.

Unknown Speaker  14:16
I don't think we're doing anything like that.

Matthias Miller  14:20
I think what we're doing is so what we're doing right now is we're creating a new transaction that has a debit

Unknown Speaker  14:34
for i

Unknown Speaker  14:43
Oh, how is this?

Unknown Speaker  14:48
You don't have Joel's detailed explanation on how that whole asset May. It can work. See I, I did have it one time, and I

Unknown Speaker  15:05
probably have it in my stack somewhere, if I look at the but that might be helpful as to what we were

Unknown Speaker  15:20
into. It.

Matthias Miller  15:30
I have the original design here which we had new transaction. The new transaction link for sale, abandonment, impairment, loss was a link to a new transaction record with default entries to zero out any of the asset accounts for this asset, as well as the line entry without any assigned account and of corresponding debit for the total value the asset. And then the amount of the impairment loss must be adjusted. So I think, I think we were saying, Well,

Unknown Speaker  15:58
If you

Unknown Speaker  16:01
sell it, then.

Unknown Speaker  16:18
Then you need to I,

Unknown Speaker  16:31
oh, let me, let me think this through a little bit.

Matthias Miller  16:42
Okay, so it so you would, what you would have to do is create your,

Matthias Miller  17:02
your debit we have a blank line with the debit amount, and so you would have, what you'd have to do is go turn that into whatever revenue account that you want to use.

Unknown Speaker  17:15
Say now is

Speaker 1  17:16
that the difference, like, is okay? So this, this, this 449 house was sold for 150,000 and some change. So would we enter 150 or would we enter the yes,

Matthias Miller  17:32
you would enter 150 and then you would create a gain or loss on sale of asset line item for the difference, and you'd have to do that manually.

Speaker 1  17:45
So you would, okay, I think this one, I'm just going to make up numbers, but let's assume that we lost 10,000 on this one. So you would on the debit line, you would say 150,000 of revenue, and you select the GL account, which we're going to select, 160,000 there, and then a negative 10,000 on the laws, and okay, on on the 160 you said the revenue account. Is that where the money goes? Or is that where we want because backing up. So we assuming we lost 10,000 on this sale of asset, we want to show the negative 10. The only place we want to show that on the income statement is in the non operating section, in the gain or loss on sale of asset,

Matthias Miller  18:37
you're right. It would be primary checking. So primary checking would have a debit of 160,000 you would not have any adjustment for accumulated depreciation, because you didn't have any. You would have a credit for 150,000 on your real estate line item for the cost. And then you have a 10,000 credit on gain or loss, on sale of asset. And the 10,000 is the only thing that would show up

Unknown Speaker  19:00
on the income statement.

Speaker 1  19:02
Now, which of these need to be manually entered? I mean, the 150 the money coming in, and the 10 I understood. What about the 160 on the cost incurred?

Unknown Speaker  19:14
Okay, yeah, the

Matthias Miller  19:17
so there'll be a blank line that starts out with 150 so if you sell it for a different amount, you'll need to change you'll need to change that amount, and you'll have to fill in the primary checking account, and then you'll have to add a line item for the gain or loss on sale of asset with the

Unknown Speaker  19:33
with that amount. Oh,

Speaker 1  19:35
do you start out with a default assuming we're selling it for exactly what we have, what it's worth, right? And then you edit that, edit that, and put in your I.

Speaker 1  20:00
In checking account, wherever the money is going, and then you have to manually calculate and enter

Matthias Miller  20:13
inner laws. Well, when you add the line item, it'll actually automatically,

Unknown Speaker  20:20
here's steps.

Speaker 1  20:24
Okay. I mean, if you could, if you could, I don't know if it how hard it would be, but if you could just write out those few steps, I think it would be super helpful. I

Unknown Speaker  20:56
and I

Speaker 2  21:48
question I had was, Let me check Something else Here. I

Unknown Speaker  23:02
All Right, give it 30 seconds, and it should be in your inbox. Okay,

Speaker 1  23:10
yes, well, that sends in one b1 I don't know if we're that far yet or not, but can you sent me a breakdown of the 449, house that the asset or what I wanted to what we wanted way we want to use this is so after we believe that an asset is ready to be put In service, then we want to take that asset, print it out, and review it with whoever the manager is, for whoever's responsible, review it with the manager and say, Okay, here's the asset, like shed trailer that you're setting up. It has, you know, the initial invoice for 70,000 and then it has $3,000 worth of lights, and it has this and this, and this, these, all of these invoices. Do we have all? Do we have all? We have everything included that should be this is everything that went into that asset. Are we missing anything? And then have a way to review that I don't know, is there? Is there something within the asset management that gives us that

Unknown Speaker  24:35
snapshot? Yes, there is.

Speaker 1  24:39
And I don't know, are you, if you have an example like the 449 house, I mean, that one has, obviously has a lot more than Well, that would be a good example if you have that. I'd like to just see how that would look and so that we can that would be one of the final steps we would take before we actually put it in service. Because we. Want to make sure we have everything included that we need to

Unknown Speaker  25:05
right, let me it's going to take a little bit.

Unknown Speaker  25:16
Okay, so I've got, no, I'm just reading update the transaction date to the date of the transaction.

Speaker 1  25:33
So you could bet you could, yeah, most likely you could back date, like in this case, I think we need to backdate it into may sometime, when that sale actually happened, sure, change account name and one to the checking account.

Speaker 1  25:51
Get the amount in line, one, sale amount, add any rules again. Oh, so this, this basically works like any typical transaction. You select your you select gain or loss and sale of asset, and then it eats your balancing the amount that would balance your to your debit automatic. Oh, yeah. Save, return the asset. Save, return to the asset and fill in the sold or a bond. Abandon on deed state of the transaction. Okay. So date, do the transaction first, and then come back and

Unknown Speaker  26:55
that looks

Speaker 1  26:58
straightforward enough to me. The real estate,

Speaker 1  27:07
150 there will that will auto fill, like the total value of the Now, what happens if we have a an asset group where we have, I don't know that we'll have it here, not sure if we have but it was, it was intended for when you have one large asset, Like a they were setting up a self storage rental unit, not not just a unit, but a like, we buy five acres of land, we set 100 units on there, 100 sheds on there. Start renting out these storage spaces. And so now we have land which doesn't depreciate. We've got buildings which do depreciate. So we said, well, we need the ability to call it asset groups, or to group that those different assets together and call it one thing, like, if we were to do a sale on one of those, would it automatically bring in the multiple 1207 accounts under that group? Or would, would we need to? We need to do each one individually, like, if we had the asset we were selling we're selling would have real estate, and it would also have some portable buildings.

Matthias Miller  29:01
Well, I think you could have a, I have not thought through partial sales, but I think you could have a treat it like an impairment loss, and it would adjust the value of the asset so it would attempt, oh, you're gonna have to calculate the you're gonna have to Calculate the depreciation on that was for that particular you okay,

Matthias Miller  29:45
what would be ideal is if you have, if you're going to, if you have that situation, and you and you're potentially selling it in pieces that you would you. You would just break it apart into separate assets.

Speaker 1  30:09
Well, okay, what, what's going to act to be the case is, what will sell the whole asset group as one? Okay? But the reason we created groups was because they have different would be called asset types, I think, like so from a a very high level this, this five acres of land, and all the storage units, the little buildings that are on there, and the gravel, and that's all from a very high level, the same asset, but they have different some of it does not depreciate, and others does depreciate on different schedules. So that was but, but we're going to sell that whole thing as as one unit. So

Matthias Miller  31:02
what? Why wouldn't you just, I don't know. Okay, the I see two solutions. One is the let's go rebuild this. And assets can have multiple classes, and you say this much for this class and this much for the other class and or this, this dollar amount goes to this class, this dollar amount of percentage goes to this class, this to this one, and it depreciates proportionately. And maybe that also is the same breakdown as the depreciate depreciation expense account. So you allocate X percentage to real estate, percentage of dollar value to real estate, X percentage of this, X percentage to that, and then we look at that to calculate depreciation, and the main thing that needs to change is how you enter depreciation, and how we calculate the depreciation, and everything else just magically works. So that's that would be the proper way to code it. The other way to do it as a workaround is, well, sorry, you're gonna have to create separate assets for each of these, and you're gonna have to track it separately. And then when you sell it, instead of posting it to the checking account in the first line item, you post it to AR. And then when you get the check you create an AR entry, GL entry for AR with the actual payment for everything

Speaker 1  32:53
I see. Well, I think that that's fine. I don't think we should. We should do any development on it right now, just because it's going to be minimal enough that I think that's fine. That keeps our depreciation on different asset types clean. Yeah, I think that's fine for right now. Okay,

Matthias Miller  33:17
yeah, I think if we'd had the foresight to do this from the get go, it wouldn't have been that much more expensive, but and going back and

Unknown Speaker  33:26
redoing is gonna create greater delay on other stuff.

Speaker 1  33:32
And so we would, in order to do that, we would basically do the selling assets, just like you have listed here, multiple like if we have three different asset types or three different partials that were selling, like, let's say it's the buildings, the land, and then the improvements would all be tracked as individual assets. You have to do this three times. And instead of posting the checking, you post it to AR until the money comes in, right? Yeah, no, that's I like that. I would actually, honestly, I think I, I prefer that, rather than trying to tie them all together and allocate depreciation, you know, dollar amount of percentage to this, this. So I think this is, is real good. Okay, cool, good, there. So are you working on a an asset management or an asset like, here's an asset, here's all the invoices, the amounts tied to it, like a breakdown or a screenshot. Is that what you're working on right now, like for the 49

Unknown Speaker  34:43
that's what it was. I got distracted.

Unknown Speaker  34:48
I was the distraction.

Matthias Miller  34:50
Let me show you

Unknown Speaker  34:52
what I've got. I.

Matthias Miller  35:01
Well, what I've got basically has date, maybe a contact for some of them, looks like not for all of them, and it has an amount and a reference number.

Unknown Speaker  35:16
Let me turn this into a PDF. I can send it to you, and

Speaker 1  35:21
this is something that's readily available. I mean, what is it just a screenshot off of the asset management, or is it like an actual

Matthias Miller  35:32
Well, this one's an actual report to do. Okay, well, actually, hang on. No, there's an easier way. Let me, let me do this to we do it to an Excel file, and I can is Drew going to be drew or Dwayne's team going to be generating this?

Unknown Speaker  35:54
Drew would be generating this. Okay, so

Matthias Miller  35:57
let me change this to landscape. Shoot this as a PDF overview,

Speaker 2  36:04
and you can take a look and see

Matthias Miller  36:08
he can easily, he can easily export it straight from the

Matthias Miller  36:17
from the asset itself. Let me send this. It'll take about 30 seconds, or delete my machine.

Unknown Speaker  36:37
Good. Well, this is exciting. I excited to see some of this start being used. Yeah, Berman went through and link most well like I know that there, most of these

Speaker 1  37:01
are selected the asset ID on most of these invoices, and we're going to have a lot of fun with that, hopefully here in third or fourth quarter yet on that, that whole storage unit thing is I would just off top of my head, of my head, I would guess that for affordable we probably have 300 buildings hanging out in finished goods inventory that really need to be moved over into be created as an asset. Because they're actually being rented out to self storage rental customers. So there they technically are an asset. We just because we haven't had a good way of handling them, we're

Unknown Speaker  38:02
well, I got it. So I got the, basically a report saying the date the account.

Speaker 1  38:19
So we've got real estate, 79,000 that's probably the initial purchase. And then we've got, oh, I know what these are. These are all

Speaker 1  38:45
okay, is this for the 449 house? Specifically? Yes, I think most of these the ones at end of month, 131, 229, 331, those are journal entries to move labor and materials in that account into basically, if I look at the second transaction, 12,015 going To assume that that was $12,015 worth of production labor that his production people put into this house. So we journal that over here. But is there kind of surprised there's so many journal entries for 131 is there there a way to show more information than like a contact, or you mentioned, some of these might have contacts, or

Unknown Speaker  39:49
we don't let me pull this transaction. So. So on the 131

Speaker 1  40:03
there's probably no contacts on there. I would think the 251 probably has a

Matthias Miller  40:09
Yeah, two five. Okay, so there's a separate report that we also have,

Unknown Speaker  40:14
which let me do this. I'm

Speaker 1  40:23
is what we what, what would be ideal for, for the user using it is date, the contact and the amount contact were typically be the vendor, sure, and notes, I guess, if we have notes, but if not, I

Matthias Miller  40:43
wonder if we should just make, I think we should just make a report.

Speaker 1  40:53
I mean, how expensive is that? It's it's one of those things where, yeah, if it's quick and easy to do, sure if it's if it's quite involved, and I'm not, not sure that it has enough value.

Matthias Miller  41:07
Well here let me, let me do this. Let me, let me send you. Just send you a screenshot. This is easier. It's incredibly slow to run again. Let me, let me show a screenshot of the other. I

Matthias Miller  41:29
so this one wouldn't have notes,

Unknown Speaker  41:33
but it would have the contact, and

Matthias Miller  41:35
it would all be and it wouldn't have the individual line items. It would just have a lump sum total, and it would not have the account either. So well,

Speaker 1  41:46
the accounts don't, I want to see that screenshot, but the accounts don't for what we're looking at it. I don't know that accounts have that big of a or that are that helpful anyway. So

Speaker 1  42:20
I guess. Well, that sense. Then on 1c make asset selection requirement for anything. Has that been done? I know we talked about it. I had some notes. And just

Matthias Miller  42:49
if we had talked about it, I fell through the cracks.

Speaker 1  42:53
Maybe, maybe Drew and I just talked about it. I

Matthias Miller  42:59
let me. Let

Unknown Speaker  43:04
me just quick, write it up and

Matthias Miller  43:12
see what would be the best, the ideal way,

Unknown Speaker  43:20
wait, chart of accounts don't we have? I

Matthias Miller  43:55
I thought we have something on the transaction itself, maybe, but we haven't applied it to the vendor invoice. Let me see.

Unknown Speaker  44:06
Yeah, I know we do.

Matthias Miller  44:22
So would

Unknown Speaker  44:32
it

Matthias Miller  44:34
okay if, if we have a fixed asset and you don't have an asset ID on the transaction.

Matthias Miller  44:56
Okay, how far do you want to take? How far do you want to take this? Because. Is so I think what I would do is, if the if the GL account is linked to a chart of account that is a fixed asset, then we could require an asset ID on the vendor invoice.

Speaker 1  45:19
I mean, I think that's okay. Repeat this back, make sure I'm understanding if the if you're creating a vendor invoice and you select a GL account that is a fixed asset, which then, then we require you to enter an asset ID before you continue. Or you have to select, you have to select an asset ID, existing asset ID before you can continue. That is that correct, right? And how do you determine fixed assets? Like, how does it know what? What's a fixed asset?

Matthias Miller  46:03
So the GL account is linked to a financial account in the accounting system, which has a type of asset and a subtype of fixed assets.

Speaker 1  46:16
That would be perfect. I mean, it's going to be painful and ugly, because we're gonna have, you know, need to get this paid, no assets. So they have two choices. One is, reach out and we get an asset. Ideally, have the asset set up and made ahead of time. But do that, or in order to keep moving, they could tie it to some other asset, but existing asset, but they shouldn't,

Matthias Miller  46:42
well, they shouldn't, or they should have a notice this is outside my, my zone of responsibility. We used to have a, you know, and I don't know, ask the accountant as through as whatever equivalent account, Uncategorized expense, you could do that and have it shown there.

Speaker 1  47:07
Well, we do have, I mean, we do have Uncategorized expenses for that, for similar reasons, like, how could they? Oh, you're saying, train them to if you run in such a situation. Then, then just put it to uncategorize the expenses, knowing that at least once a month who will come across those, and then create the asset needed and link it and take care of it. I like that good,

Speaker 1  47:50
good. So I think that, okay, how much? Yeah, how much is required to make that happen? Is that pretty straightforward?

Matthias Miller  48:00
Well, I have a follow up question with this. Okay, we also have validation that says that if that you can't, where we warn if the asset is already in service and you in,

Unknown Speaker  48:18
in you, I

Unknown Speaker  48:25
Yeah,

Matthias Miller  48:27
and you have an expense against it,

Unknown Speaker  48:31
and your question on that is, you

Matthias Miller  48:36
want to enforce that in vendor invoices that you can't if you've put the asset in service, you can't put more expenses against it.

Speaker 1  48:47
Yes, I'd like to make so that it's not just a warning, but you you can't actually do it, just to prove it,

Matthias Miller  48:56
and then also that you can't have any expenses after. Well, this is irrelevant. It's gonna say after it's been sold or abandoned. I mean, we can still block it, but there shouldn't be any way to even get to that point, because it would

Unknown Speaker  49:16
be the service by that point.

Speaker 1  49:22
Oh, but in this situation like this house, there could something that we never put in service. Could have, you have a really, really late invoice and you don't block it, you could, I don't know if the asset is sold, does it still well, okay, well, well, okay, can we, can we make this even maybe this is what you're thinking. But When? When? When they go to high so they, they create the invoice, and they go to get the i. I find the asset ID. The only assets that should be showing up in that list are assets that have been obviously, assets that have been created but have not yet been put in service and not yet been sold or about abandoned like that's all they should see, and they would typically, is that what they're seeing now? Or, I don't know, could we enforce it from that, from that site? Because otherwise, yeah, so, so just keeps the list really short, and they usually have, like, three, four or five assets they can pay.

Unknown Speaker  50:41
Yeah, let's do this.

Matthias Miller  50:47
So make sure the list of assets in the vendor this non po asset list only shows assets are not in service.

Unknown Speaker  51:01
Ie, the answer is, D is blank, and then I

Unknown Speaker  51:40
all right, this is,

Matthias Miller  51:47
yep, oh, sorry, no,

Unknown Speaker  51:51
Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  52:02
let's See GL account,

Unknown Speaker  53:12
all right, One more thing, yeah,

Matthias Miller  53:43
all right, there we go. Let me shoot this over to I mean, this is good to go. Let me shoot this over to Seth and,

Speaker 1  54:02
okay, good. That also something that can go live Saturday, or is that more more involved?

Matthias Miller  54:12
I don't know exactly what his workload is. There's a good chance, but he's working on asset stuff, so I would expect he'd try to work it in. But I don't think it's, it's not highly involved. So unless he's got other pressing things, it should, it should happen.

Speaker 1  54:34
Well, you said Audra is joining at 1030 I was wondering, should we? Should we? Do? We wait to cover those projects till maybe next week and keep going through through this list or what's what works best for you.

Matthias Miller  54:57
I think that I.

Unknown Speaker  55:01
I think it's fine. I yeah, I don't. I don't really have a problem with that.

Matthias Miller  55:12
I can. I can let her know. I can let her know

Unknown Speaker  55:13
that we'll just post on until next week. Yeah, I

Unknown Speaker  55:23
so Okay, looking at the accounting transactions report that you send. So this, I'm a little bit confused on the first report you send. I I see, I think that that second report is, yeah, is all we need now, is that? Is that simply? What is that? Just a screenshot from the Asset Management site.

Matthias Miller  56:06
Let me just do that. It's transactions from the let me just type up another email for Drew and CCU, and then we've got instructions how To access it.

Unknown Speaker  56:22
I got Okay, that'll be good assets.

Unknown Speaker  56:49
A screenshot like this,

Unknown Speaker  57:01
or you can download it as an Excel file like this. So I

Unknown Speaker  57:50
all right, coming your way.

Speaker 1  57:56
Okay, good. Well, that's been helpful in assets. So excited to see that. And then just posted on C there, when that has those live anything else on one before we jump to

Speaker 1  58:17
Okay, so undeposited funds, aiding report I had sent this to you last week. Have you looked at this at all, or should? Should we just run through it real quick? Okay, so we need some type of aging report for undeposited funds to bring good tangent funds that were debited to undeposited funds but never had a matching credit. We tried, we, as in June, I, tried to create a report for doing this using the account balance diagnostics, but it did not work well for undeposited funds. We were, the reason we were doing that was trying to reconcile or do an audit of what the balance sheet number that the balance sheet set for undeposited funds, and just look at that and see, does this look legit, or are there problems here, like things that? So that's why I'm saying it. That's was the intent we were looking at it there. But for, for what we're needing, this, this report, aging report, undeposited funds, aging report, whatever we call it, B for normal business, no funds should be non deposited funds longer than before we have longer than that. It would be an indication of a problem like salesman took in a cash payment and recorded payment on the sales order. But no deposit record was ever created in cash was no deposit in bank. So that could happen, the hauler collected the check from customer and payment was recorded. However, no deposit record ever created in the check I lost on hauler stroke. So the currently, we have no good way of seeing these problems, and then I can. Technical details on what I think we need to need there. And then I created, probably the next page what I would see as an

Unknown Speaker  1:00:10
a example of how that report worked using some actual, actual data so on. On this one, what according to the transaction,

Speaker 1  1:00:28
the sales order modification history on the sales order, a payment date was recorded, 422, for a check in that amount with those payment notes ordered by ginger, and then it was for it went 49 days until we had a deposit, until that was put on a deposit record and we put it in the bank. Now, the moment it gets put on a deposit record, it that ensures that it goes through a a reconcile reconciliation process, being reconciled with positive record and bank bank statement. So like this was a good example of one where we should have been asking questions, long before 49 days were of like horses check, get it to the bank, right? So,

Unknown Speaker  1:01:33
thoughts, questions, ideas,

Unknown Speaker  1:01:39
let me see I am just throwing together so

Matthias Miller  1:02:05
going together an approximation of what the same look like. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:02:11
so this would be the payment date. Let me clarify this to payment, amount, payment. All

Matthias Miller  1:02:41
right, so this one, we see this one shows up to 40415,

Matthias Miller  1:02:51
did this one get resolved then?

Speaker 1  1:02:54
Well, the day after, on 611 it was, we had a deposit for it. That doesn't mean it was deposited in the bank that day. Just means that somebody created a deposit rate. Yeah, and it's supposed to match with when it goes to the bank. But I of course, make this one look real bad, or pick one that found one that looks real bad and and showed it like 49 days the day before the deposit record. But it

Unknown Speaker  1:03:26
sure let me

Matthias Miller  1:03:31
do this. I think this one sometimes it's quite honestly easier just to mock up a report and get it most of the way there, rather than spec it all out.

Speaker 2  1:03:42
So this would be aging for undeposited funds. Oh, and we should exclude not so is quote and not so is canceled, or so canceled is canceled. Okay?

Speaker 1  1:04:03
Yeah, I don't think we need to go down that bunny trail right now on canceled. So you know what? Should occasionally we have a payment on something that's then later canceled. But let, let's not bother with that for right now. I don't do

Matthias Miller  1:04:18
you want to include quotes and cancelations.

Speaker 1  1:04:27
Well, I Okay, what I want this report to show is anything, any payment we said we took in that is, is stranded in undeposited funds, kind of in no man's land for technically it should even be there longer than two weeks.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:50
No. What happens whale? I. All right.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:04
Cancelations, exactly how that would,

Matthias Miller  1:05:11
yeah, I can just include everything in

Unknown Speaker  1:05:15
activity. Mod, use. Archie. Let's see if I can do this easily. This would be The person audit I'm

Matthias Miller  1:06:21
see. Okay, and then on the date do you want? Do you want the time since the payment was entered, or the time since the payment date?

Speaker 1  1:06:58
So, so we could have two different dates. The the time since the payment date that that's whoever's putting it in is saying as of this day, right? Yeah, and default, like I would expect most of the time, that's today, right? Yes, there is it, a situation where sales people have no option, they just defaults to the data. And only Dwayne's office can just, or can edit the payment date. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:07:30
I think that's right.

Speaker 1  1:07:33
And that sounds then let's go with the payment date. Yes. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:07:37
so let's do i All right, I'm going to send this over to you as a PDF, and I'm

Speaker 1  1:08:00
it, because, yeah, like one like this, this one was kind of hidden from view because on AR, it didn't show up on AR Because it we record a payment. It moves all, okay, this was, this was obviously a a down payment. So it wouldn't have even been on AR yet, but,

Unknown Speaker  1:08:33
sure, yeah,

Speaker 1  1:08:33
it would have moved out of customer deposits. No, it just, yeah, I've been hidden.

Speaker 1  1:08:54
Probably within the accounting world, there's probably a standardized name, and name criteria for this? Is it just an payment aging report, or What?

Unknown Speaker  1:09:07
What is it called? Yeah, that's fair. I

Unknown Speaker  1:10:42
Oh, Wow. We dig up a lot of stuff here.

Matthias Miller  1:10:47
So yeah, I mean we might want to cut off.

Speaker 1  1:11:02
So is this as of today? This one?

Unknown Speaker  1:11:06
Yes, yeah. Oh, and you had a this is

Matthias Miller  1:11:16
everything you had a minimum number of days, which you wanted it to be.

Speaker 1  1:11:21
Well, no, I don't know. I mean, in a lot of ways, as long as it's sorted, I think having everything on here is is good. So just looking for,

Speaker 1  1:11:40
if I go to the bottom of page one, I have a $3,000 payment on other, says a down payment on 12 to 24 garage like that. One's suspect like 82 days ago, $3,000 payment of other, which we don't allow other anymore, do we?

Speaker 2  1:11:58
No, I which

Unknown Speaker  1:12:03
is it's a good change, but

Speaker 1  1:12:18
in that we're seeing that money never showed up on a deposit and don't know where it is. Oh, you have, you have all three companies here. So does the one we were looking at that one's probably not here, no, because it says of today sort of been resolved. But,

Speaker 1  1:12:45
okay, well, we're getting a lot of noise in here as well. Is that because of cancelations and stuff?

Matthias Miller  1:12:52
Well, that's what I'm trying to figure out. Like, I mean, we have one here, a wholesale building by a wholesale build building with a credit and not tied to anything that's a little concerning. Some of them are just old. I mean, we could maybe just do a long time date go ahead

Speaker 1  1:13:25
of Yeah, that's what I was going to suggest, like everything prior to this year. Should I think we should just ignore or have a minimum date of one, 124,

Unknown Speaker  1:13:42
can you Okay, one, 120, 24 All right, so that,

Speaker 1  1:13:47
and it takes off some, but not a huge amount. At least, I'm looking at Ohio. But why are other? So we have a donation building. They just put in payment of other. Get it up properly. But then, okay,

Matthias Miller  1:14:09
let me we could start going the whole way down. So an ABC $1,000 credit.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:20
Which one are you looking at

Matthias Miller  1:14:21
the like, I'm sorry, the on 111

Unknown Speaker  1:14:34
Nick issued a credits.

Speaker 1  1:14:41
But okay, what we wouldn't do? We need to show credits in here. I'm thinking all negative amounts, all credits like that. We could

Matthias Miller  1:14:53
eliminate negative amounts.

Speaker 1  1:14:56
Well, are we missing something? Then we go down to 220, Seven, and then we have a check for 4918 and a negative for the same amount, right amount should be applied on building.

Matthias Miller  1:15:09
And so what should have happened is we should have created a $0 deposit to work well, or, or use a non depositable method, payment method to do it. Or, I don't know. I mean, we could create a $0 deposit to make them tie out

Unknown Speaker  1:15:28
and disappear.

Speaker 1  1:15:33
I'm a little nervous to just take it. No, I think leave those on there if we have the cutoff dates. No, I think what we have here is fine, because if we there's, like, looking at Ohio, there's not, if we take out, we're left with probably 20 buildings if you take out, if you have a cut off date of one, one, and There's a lot just, you know, 1514, days that right? Yeah, yeah, no, let's, let's leave, leave it as is. What are all the NAS? Is that stuff we can just

Matthias Miller  1:16:17
all of them are old, except for the last one is a wholesale credit that was not tied to a dealer, and so we don't know which accounting

Unknown Speaker  1:16:29
company it goes to, and You wrote a check.

Unknown Speaker  1:16:41
Okay? Is that I n2, 5475122, on 620, 24

Unknown Speaker  1:16:45
Yeah,

Speaker 1  1:16:49
I'd say just get, get rid of the NAS as well. Does that mean we don't have a but that means we have no dealer for it,

Unknown Speaker  1:17:04
yes, but those,

Speaker 1  1:17:06
those are all sheds to rate buildings.

Matthias Miller  1:17:10
We could exclude you don't want to exclude you would want to exclude wholesale buildings? Would you?

Unknown Speaker  1:17:16
No, I don't want to exclude them, but, but we're not showing any just rake buildings. But why is that? Because we,

Matthias Miller  1:17:28
well, you would always,

Speaker 1  1:17:31
yeah, we record payment the same time we do deposits. So so these could all just be okay if we had, if we had a shed strike building where we recorded a payment but didn't do deposit right away, it would show up here, right?

Matthias Miller  1:17:45
Well, I mean, aren't she straight? Buildings normally tied to a dealer,

Speaker 1  1:17:51
they are like sheds. Directive i And Josh changed them now to where they used to be coming to assist to all of their like named as all of their dealers. But he then made a change, so it just says jets direct of oh eight for Ohio, and jets directive i n for Indiana. So yes, they would be for the sake of keeping things yes, but let's get rid of the NA and then we'll not too concerned about the sheds direct. So, so

Unknown Speaker  1:18:28
okay,

Matthias Miller  1:18:28
I mean, you can make an argument that it's a mistake and that we should have assigned it to sheds direct of Indiana, but I can exclude

Unknown Speaker  1:18:39
them. So, okay, okay, so we'll exclude any as well.

Speaker 1  1:18:51
Okay, so looking at like, looking at Indiana,

Unknown Speaker  1:19:00
we've got a check on three, one that was we've got cash on 226, that never was deposited. A check three, one was never deposited. We've got a training test to not process, to do to think,

Unknown Speaker  1:19:27
well, that would having this report would clean up like that, and then we've got a lot of outstanding there. And if we go to vinyl, clean out everything prior to 24

Unknown Speaker  1:19:54
ash other i.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:02
A silly right of stuff this

Speaker 1  1:20:09
minute correctly, and Stripe payments do not go through here, because am I correct? Stripe payments automatically go down deposited funds and then immediately leave on deposited funds.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:27
Yeah. Now,

Matthias Miller  1:20:31
yeah. Strike payments get handled automatically through payouts. Now, there are some here. This will be interesting to figure out how to clean up. There's some two here that are stripe payments,

Unknown Speaker  1:20:46
the one,

Matthias Miller  1:20:49
one for Ohio on March the ninth, and one for vinyl structures for

Unknown Speaker  1:20:56
sorry, June 27 i

Unknown Speaker  1:21:06
i said June,

Matthias Miller  1:21:10
but if you would change those to be credit card types

Unknown Speaker  1:21:16
disappear from this list because they can't be deposited. Sure.

Speaker 1  1:21:23
So is this list filtered by, oh, you're saying, if that payment method were were changed to credit card, they would disappear, right? It would disappear this.

Matthias Miller  1:21:35
This is filtered by all payment methods that are depositable.

Speaker 1  1:21:40
Oh, and, but, but on 627, did we still allow other at that point? Yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:21:50
or somebody had left it blank and we backed for live as other or something

Unknown Speaker  1:21:53
like that. I think I

Speaker 1  1:22:04
Okay, now in Okay, good. I think this is good.

Speaker 1  1:22:19
So what? What do we need to do to turn this into, I mean, I say, let's go ahead and turn this into a standard report, one per district, and, yeah, set it up as a standard report, unless you think we should use it as a user report for the time being. And then no. Now

Unknown Speaker  1:22:43
let's This is,

Unknown Speaker  1:22:57
figure out where it should go accounts. I Okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:23:05
all right, I don't

Unknown Speaker  1:23:06
know you have an accounts receivable area, but it's, it seems to me, It would be,

Unknown Speaker  1:23:12
oh yes, mostly related to that. I

Unknown Speaker  1:23:46
this would be

Matthias Miller  1:23:49
aging, undeposited payments, aging,

Unknown Speaker  1:23:59
yeah, I Like that.

Unknown Speaker  1:24:10
Okay,

Matthias Miller  1:24:11
good shot that over to Seth.

Speaker 2  1:24:20
Do Okay, so

Speaker 1  1:24:27
you have a cut outfit, what like a little after 11?

Unknown Speaker  1:24:31
Yeah, I can go until about, I don't know, five or 10 after

Speaker 1  1:24:40
Okay, well, then let's, let's look at three and four, if we can. So three accounts receivable, report at days outstanding on the accounts received, report at a column the far right, report for days outstanding, which pretty straightforward. I think the bigger one is, we looked at this some I know previously, but I. But haven't gotten it resolved yet. So the in B total, the two accounts for sealed reports, needs to match with the number on the balance sheet. Let's start with vinyl structures. As of 630 since bank is asking for an AR agent report and for numbers show a discrepancy, 110,000 looking at at it drew and I believe the number the balance sheet is mostly accurate. What could you provide to help us resolve this discrepancy? And that was looking at using the account diagnostics report that you've created, seeing which ones transactions came in and went out, just looking at the ones that were either just hit one side of the transaction or they did not have matching amounts on the transaction.

Speaker 1  1:25:55
I know that that was we had started looking at that, working through that part of it was we needed to have payment methods on the accounts receivable report. Required that you have a payment method entered and the balance sheet did not. There was some basically, well this, I guess, is there anything you could do to help us figure that out, or is there just need to dig in and work through each one and figure out what what needs to really my question,

Matthias Miller  1:26:36
the first thing I would do,

Unknown Speaker  1:26:39
I don't know that this is I

Matthias Miller  1:26:43
don't really have a good way to do this without doing it somewhat manually. Um, let's do this so all accounting transactions where the account Transaction Date is less than equal to 630, 24, and accounting transaction company

Speaker 2  1:27:07
actually count trans by account and date in the next Five part account. List, no accounts and

Matthias Miller  1:27:59
Okay, so everything you don't have any manual You don't have any manual transactions. So

Unknown Speaker  1:28:08
There's that.

Unknown Speaker  1:28:20
Um, counts receivable.

Unknown Speaker  1:28:37
Let's do This.

Unknown Speaker  1:29:01
Alright, so We've got a

Unknown Speaker  1:29:47
so we would expect

Speaker 2  1:29:55
here, let's try this now. Let's run this one's for SDI.

Unknown Speaker  1:30:22
The covid

Unknown Speaker  1:30:31
Actually I'm

Matthias Miller  1:31:59
all right, let me Okay, So there are no manual transactions in that date range.

Matthias Miller  1:32:11
We just save as here,

Unknown Speaker  1:32:15
and this is going to be 20, 2408, 15. 15, AR diagnostics, okay, so this one is,

Matthias Miller  1:32:37
so we have buildings. I that for some reason or other, are not getting pushed out to accounting.

Unknown Speaker  1:33:02
So let me run these and download them and get them over to you.

Speaker 1  1:33:45
So looking at this, which which number, I don't think any of them is accurate, but are you seeing the balance sheet or the accounts receivable report is well?

Matthias Miller  1:34:04
I'm not sure there is nothing in AR. I'm not seeing anything in AR that well, okay, I hesitate making two broad statements, so trust that, verify I'm not seeing anything on the balance sheet that's not in the AR report, but I am seeing things in the AR report that are not on the balance sheet.

Speaker 1  1:34:35
Yeah, which, okay. And so what we're trying to figure out is, I know, when we looked at it previously, a lot of ones on the AR report were there because there's no payment method entered and things like that, which kept them hanging out on the AR report.

Matthias Miller  1:35:07
Are you sure these aren't connected with ones that G let's see. Let's

Unknown Speaker  1:35:10
see. How did this get voided? Location history?

Matthias Miller  1:35:21
Didn't we void a bunch of old AR? No,

Speaker 1  1:35:31
so you had something there was you did a mass entry of or payment method was missing. I think you went in and also entered a bunch of put in other for those, like a lot of historical ones. But I guess here we're just looking at,

Matthias Miller  1:35:54
well, this report isn't the full story, either, because we changed the effective date. So this is showing, actually showing no accounting impact for all historical ones. But here's a sales order, the $69 credit or no. Where is this? Under? Under SDI?

Unknown Speaker  1:36:15
Well,

Matthias Miller  1:36:21
yeah, under the NA category, under SDI there, I don't know, because this isn't filtered correctly.

Unknown Speaker  1:36:27
Silly me, we

Speaker 1  1:36:30
don't care about those. Well, should we? I don't know how your rest of your day looks, but should we, should we look at regrouping on this, just because all the banks asking for it and obviously can't send. I mean, it's, that's why it's, it's rather urgent. We have something sooner rather than later. Or, yeah, what would work for you or make sense for you, I guess.

Matthias Miller  1:36:54
Well, my next two days are

Unknown Speaker  1:37:01
lamp packed.

Matthias Miller  1:37:12
Okay, here is one sales order, a, a, b, h, here, let

Unknown Speaker  1:37:20
me just,

Unknown Speaker  1:37:23
are you looking at the AR report, or what are you? No,

Unknown Speaker  1:37:25
yeah, I'm looking No, but this one doesn't have,

Matthias Miller  1:37:31
yeah, this one has never. This one's on the AR report, but never posted the AR

Matthias Miller  1:37:42
so this one is part, at least part of the issue.

Unknown Speaker  1:37:47
Let me send a screenshot.

Speaker 1  1:37:51
Is is the first thing we need to do is make sure we're using the same criteria for accounting as we are on the ER report, or what is it seems like?

Unknown Speaker  1:38:12
Should we? Should?

Matthias Miller  1:38:18
I would have to, I mean, the have you done a cross checking, going meticulously through the account balance diagnostic and through the other one, and just like you used to reconcile bank registers back in the day, check them off one by one.

Speaker 1  1:38:38
Drew did he started with that, yeah. I mean, is that what we should? We should just continue with that for right now, and hopefully with that, diagnose the issues.

Matthias Miller  1:38:53
Well, I mean, it seems like, I mean, you can maybe make it go faster by exporting it to Excel and having all relevant sales order IDs and doing V lookups to go find this or the other and save yourself some manual hassle. But I kind of think, I don't know. I kind of think the brute force method might be a faster way to get to the root of it than

Matthias Miller  1:39:39
I don't know what it won't Yeah? Because either way, it should surface. It should surface. What the issue is between those two reports, something should not be showing that should be showing up in one. Should visit on the other racers, I would think, I

Speaker 1  1:40:05
sure, well, you've got to run the will chase that will go that route with withdrew you working on that. And what about like first of next week, any, any? Shoot me an email to but do you have any openings

Unknown Speaker  1:40:27
we could I don't know. I kind of

Matthias Miller  1:40:38
kind of scaled way back, potentially, I would have to negotiate with Ellis. I've got

Unknown Speaker  1:40:50
my next
