Unknown Speaker  08:48
I don't need a sheet of the screen share or not, but. All right. I don't need a sheet of the screen share or not, but. All right. right off the bat. All right. right off the bat. All right. So item data right missing. sheet of the screen share or not, but. All right. Be good, yep, I'm good. Got it be with me. Okay, sorry, we got Yes, I'm with you. No, I'm just like, I'm saying, like, Can. All right. Hey, all right. George is entering data in. right. I don't need a sheet of the screen share or not, but. um, right off the bat, George is entering data in um so item data, right, missing item data, He entered a new item code, specifically fa, 586, well, we should maybe go to the How about if I just go to the platform I'll share first. I'm all right, yeah, it's fine. You see my screen, I can see you.

Matthias Miller  10:06
SBC, dot,

Speaker 1  10:14
boom. All right. Item in the items list, it is now. He entered the data, fa, 586, it's not here. Matt, if I go, if I type it in, if fa, 586, then I find it. Well, anyway, it shows up, and then we have to go here. Can't remember. Is that double click,

Matthias Miller  11:04
click on the blue part?

Unknown Speaker  11:07
Okay, yep, then there it is. Okay, let

Matthias Miller  11:10
me take a look.

Matthias Miller  11:19
F, A, five, eight. I five, eight.

Matthias Miller  11:31
Well, hang on.

Matthias Miller  12:11
Uh, okay, it's, it's the issue here is that that list is not sorted. So that's really the it's all the way down at the bottom of the other list. So if you, if you type it in, or if you scroll down to the bottom of the list, you'll see it. It's just not where you expect to see it.

Speaker 1  12:29
Okay? You say what you're saying. It wasn't sorted.

Matthias Miller  12:35
So if you go back, you go to the item, and you scroll all the way down to the bottom, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  12:42
Do When does that get sorted? We

Matthias Miller  12:45
had changed it to be auto sorted. Oh, okay, just, I just got missed it.

Speaker 1  12:50
Got it so that's taken care of. I'm trying to look there. I snapped it. I'm gonna go back air this way. Bam, bam, bam.

Speaker 1  13:19
There we go. We were both of us. George said, What's saw on multiplier? And I said, I don't exactly remember, like I do, but I don't. Man, Matt, can, can you help me on these multipliers? Yes,

Matthias Miller  13:36
so when a saw splits, quantity splits to increase quantity. This is the question of by how much. So if it gets split into two, you put a two here, and your raw material quantity would then be two, and your saw one yield would be four. Same for saw two. So actually, no, it actually works back backwards, because total yield is two. So if you put a saw two multiplier in of two, total yield still is two, but saw one yields one, and your all material would be one.

Speaker 1  14:16
Okay, so we're all material, raw material quantity is two. See, how does that

Matthias Miller  14:32
the quantity up above here in your lumber, the quantity in your lumber is the the the yield is the yield quantity. And so if you put in multipliers, it doesn't adjust the yield quantity. It decreases your raw material quantity, yeah,

Speaker 1  14:54
so l and m to splitter is nothing. Salt to. Multiplier would be two, I believe.

Matthias Miller  15:08
And then if you tab off, click off, one

Speaker 1  15:15
inch. No, it's one inch. So there's no multiplier. I can't, I can't do that, not if it's one inch, but

Matthias Miller  15:23
if it's splitting, then what is it splitting?

Speaker 1  15:29
Okay, so pendu splitter. It does split, but it also will also use it just to run one inch through as a planer, sure to make it, yeah, yeah. Got it. You're just

Matthias Miller  15:40
planing it, not splitting it, yep. So sometimes

Speaker 1  15:42
this pendu splitter is just a planer and not a split. Yep. We don't always split it, which

Matthias Miller  15:49
is in the miscellaneous prep there,

Speaker 1  15:54
plain, 7/8, inch, Yep, yeah, right, right. Okay, so that's what it is. I don't remember. We did it for a reason. Multiplier, multiplier, yes,

Matthias Miller  16:06
so that we can correctly calculate wedges, so that we can correctly calculate quantities, basically, for wedges and stuff like that. And

Speaker 1  16:15
but there's no we don't have a multiplier coming off of sizers, right? It's just

Unknown Speaker  16:20
right fine when we're splitting um,

Speaker 1  16:26
when we when we take sizer material and run it on salt, on installing later, next step, we're entering that raw material info, brand new again. So that's where that needs to be entered, right? All right,

Matthias Miller  16:47
okay, there is

Unknown Speaker  16:49
a yeah

Matthias Miller  16:50
path in the future where theoretically we could automate the potentially the song or the selling raw material. But we're not there yet.

Speaker 1  17:00
Yeah, yeah, that's, yeah, that's fine, yep. Um, okay, so are we? Are we in a place where we could try, I could try the some, getting some reports off of the score calculator, or scoring,

Matthias Miller  17:20
so does. Does George have all of the mean, George thinks he has all of his stuff. I'm gonna duck off screen, but I'm just gonna be he'll be here. Does George think he has all of the stuff entered?

Speaker 1  17:35
So I don't know that answer. He's working on it. I can give him a quick call.

Matthias Miller  17:42
I mean, we have it maybe 95% accurate at this point. I still haven't had a chance to push those two order quantities in from Tina, and then anything that any of those items from George would be wrong. But also there's no reason why we couldn't start having John start putting in tracking into this system now, okay,

Speaker 1  18:13
okay, I'll try to get him to do that starting today, Monday, June, 2, you know,

Matthias Miller  18:25
and then and I, did you want to? Are you comfortable with walking him through that? Did you want to?

Speaker 1  18:34
So? Good question, good question, um, let's, let's you and I walk through it a little bit once. If that's okay, that'd be great. Am I going

Matthias Miller  18:47
assembly tracker, Tracker. Let's go right and then hit new assembly work order on the top, right. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  18:55
new moves. Okay,

Matthias Miller  19:01
yep. And then you're going to fill in completed on so you can put, if it's today, you can put t for today, or you could put in the date 616, slash 1t

Unknown Speaker  19:12
for today,

Matthias Miller  19:16
or or just like, month a day,

Unknown Speaker  19:19
or something like that. I'm sorry, okay, completed on my box. One, uh, click,

Matthias Miller  19:26
click the Schedule. You unscheduled. It accidentally, so click the scheduled, okay, and then six, one, the I want the

Unknown Speaker  19:36
completion date in here. Yes, 25 or 2024 How I

Matthias Miller  19:43
think that should work? Okay? There's a lot of different formats that let's use. Okay, sort order doesn't matter. Type doesn't like it's going to stay assembly, because that's what it is. So then you're going to go down break times. These are just copied from your settings. So he doesn't we just. Keeping that on here in case break times change in the future. Then hit the plus under employee

Unknown Speaker  20:07
down here, yep, choose your first well, what's this plus up here, above employee,

Matthias Miller  20:12
break times.

Speaker 1  20:14
Okay, okay, so plus under employee, bam, choose your choose your guy, grab the guy, put

Matthias Miller  20:25
in your start time. So you can do things like, like you can type in eight a for 8am 2p for 2pm or you can do eight o'clock. I think you could do 14 o'clock, if you want to. You

Speaker 1  20:44
14 P actually did the job. Actually works,

Matthias Miller  20:48
which doesn't make sense. That's fine. 14 a probably actually also works, which is weird, but

Unknown Speaker  20:55
All right,

Matthias Miller  21:02
that's Yep,

Unknown Speaker  21:06
all right, and then, and then hit

Matthias Miller  21:09
plus, okay for your second guy and drop, pick the name, yeah, it'll copy from up above, yeah, so it always copies one down. So then if you need to change one, you know, maybe, yeah, there you go.

Speaker 1  21:30
Down. Can I get the down or the right or left arrow tab

Matthias Miller  21:35
or Shift Tab? Tab, yep.

Speaker 1  21:40
Now, down. Now I gotta go. Must sign plus sign again,

Matthias Miller  21:45
and then pick the next guy. Now he's gonna copy at 1pm because that's what you had,

Matthias Miller  21:59
yep. All right. So now you got and then this, if you scroll to the right, I don't know if you care. It doesn't matter for John, but if you just for your you might be interested. So you got break time, total time, the contribution percentage time and downtime will be broken down. And then, then the assembly hours. So then put in your the setup time should be underneath the item go. That really should be moved. Those three items should be moved up. I'm going to make a note to move them, move assembly. So then, then he would put in the assembly item,

Speaker 1  22:41
which is sage order row ID or No, scroll

Matthias Miller  22:45
up, oh. Assembly item, it's in the middle of those three boxes. Scroll down, just a little bit right down, just a little bit more right there that. Yeah, no, middle of your screen, assembly item. There you go, pick, pick what he built. They built, all right, and it grabs the customers, grabs the setup time, put in any downtime that they had,

Speaker 1  23:14
all right. So, yeah, setup time, customer downtime is added automatic. Wait. Now I have to enter downtime. You

Matthias Miller  23:23
do have to enter downtime. Okay,

Speaker 1  23:24
so I'm gonna say 1515, that's in minutes, but

Matthias Miller  23:32
at the quantity, how much they built, you know? And now we don't have any orders for them. So if you just leave it blank, it's going to warn you when you save and say, hey, look, it's not tied out to an order. Are you sure this is right? But right now, if you scroll up to this at the employees, now you should be able to see inside the employees with those, scroll over to the right there. You should be able to see what how the downtime and setup times distributed. Click the little scroll to the right in your employee box. I You're

Unknown Speaker  24:25
saying here.

Speaker 1  24:34
Connection is unstable. What in that? Harry, sorry, dude, we had our provider came out, they put in two Wi Fi extenders in the other part of the office. And now I sit in a conference room and I have dips in a in a signal here, for whatever reason.

Matthias Miller  24:53
That's weird. Oh, good. All right, so set up. So now you see set up time. Set up time got broke. Out three ways. Wait,

Speaker 1  25:03
don't tell me this is doing it again. I hang on, dude. Now, what were you saying about looking at the each employee, so

Matthias Miller  25:17
set up time, if you scroll right, you can see how the setup time sometimes broken down. Yeah, 10 minutes each. Downtime is broken out, which isn't exact. Anyway, that's not exactly right, because one guy started later. But anyway, then we have downtime, 15 minutes each, because obviously the one's down, all's down. And then you have the total assembly hours for each person

Speaker 1  25:41
that's gonna be, that's, that's an interesting thing, because, like, the downtime shouldn't be if, if there was two guys, yeah, they shouldn't all get downtime. It just

Matthias Miller  25:53
well for that, you actually need to know when the downtime was, right, right, right, right, right. And on the setup time. Really, what you need to know is what the time was. Because if they did set up from eight to 830 then second guy didn't do any setup,

Speaker 1  26:09
right? Exactly? Well, the setup time could always be at the beginning, but I don't know how

Matthias Miller  26:16
well we could, we could do set up time based on the ear earliest. Well, we have, haven't go ahead.

Speaker 1  26:22
Here's the thing we we, well, sorry, yeah, I interrupted you. I'll just continue though. This is not going to happen very often. It does happen. When it does happen. Can we come over here and override these numbers as needed?

Matthias Miller  26:42
We could, yes, yes, we could for both setup time and downtime.

Speaker 1  26:50
I mean, that'll be a fairly simple way to do it, unless you have a better idea.

Matthias Miller  26:57
No, I think that's fine. And then the downtime, this, this downtime that we show down below, would just be the longest downtime across any I mean, it's not completely accurate, but it would be the longest downtime across all employees. So if one person was down for 21, was down for 10, we're going to assume that that's non contiguous, or that's it's not that they were down for 30, but just that they were down for 20. When we show the total number, it doesn't really matter. It's just, why wouldn't we make Why would we make downtime be something we could also move downtime to the left and make downtime something that's copied down every time, like a Start Time, End Time, downtime. I don't really care John. John, from my my observation of the data, John's not the kind of person where he's going to go back and say, oh no. Actually, this this much downtime was here and this much was there, unless we make him spell out where the downtime when it happened exactly.

Speaker 1  28:18
Well, the guys aren't spelling that out right now, either. They're just jotting down five minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, whatever they're doing, which is an easy chicken scratch. There's no accountability around it, per se,

Matthias Miller  28:36
you could so if you wanted to, I think the only real way to get the get the people to do what you want is if you can have the guys in the shop say we were down from 905, to 910, yeah, and John puts it in. So I guess the question is, do you want to go to that work I

Speaker 1  28:54
did? Well, the answer probably is, we probably should. We probably need to. Yeah. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  29:08
And then yeah, and

Matthias Miller  29:09
then we also have a setup time start and a setup time end, where we'll just auto calculate based on when the first guy started to to well, that gets a little COVID. Little complicated, too. We but we could, I mean, we could do it. We could say if one guy starts at 815 and eight o'clock, the other two guys start at 815 then that's 15 minutes. And you take the last 15 minutes, split that three ways, right? It's a little,

Speaker 1  29:40
yeah, we can do that. But at same time it's, it's usually two guy. It's usually going to be those two guys. Sure be three. But yeah, I mean, if it's, if it's always base, if it's always spread out at the front,

Matthias Miller  29:57
so could we just assign the. Could we make it as simple as assigning setup time to whichever guys started working? Hey, Matt,

Speaker 1  30:07
lost you again for a second. All right, you respond to that? I'm sorry,

Matthias Miller  30:12
yeah. So we could, we could change setup time instead of applying to everybody, but just apply it to whoever, to whichever guys clocked in first. So if two people clock in at eight, we give it to, okay, perfect. Yeah,

Speaker 1  30:24
if one guy clocks in a half hour earlier, he gets all the setup time. He better have it set up, right?

Matthias Miller  30:29
And, I mean, we could even say, and I don't know how you want to do this, just avoid making it complicated, because it's so rare, we'd say, if he, even if he clocks in 15 minutes earlier. He gets all the setup time. They all have to clock in at the same time to get the setup time. Or is that too simplistic?

Speaker 1  30:51
Um, yeah, I think just. I mean, if those two guys jump in, he's 15 minutes and the rest of them jump in there, they each get five after that out of 30. That's fine, okay, um, George popped in here. I want to make sure

Speaker 2  31:10
they got a fire out back here, back by the West shop again, and this whole this out in front of the shop, longer yard, the hall, that lumber yard I'm full of covered with smoke. Come on.

Speaker 1  31:24
Hey, Matt, yeah, do you want to Cat tell George about that? What you did on the George? Matt, just he fixed that. Hey, bro, I'll

Matthias Miller  31:38
tell you what the issue with the item not showing up was just because the item list wasn't sorted. You got to scroll down all the way down to the bottom. So I'll make I'll make sure they're sorted alphabetically. But that that's why you weren't finding that the item that you added, alright.

Speaker 2  31:55
So it was, you're saying that was a whole way at the bottom. If I scrolled the whole way down, it was at the very bottom. Yes, alright, so way you're going to set it up, then it'll be in the FA numbers,

Matthias Miller  32:08
yeah, I'll, I'll fix it to auto sort it's just, it was just, again, an oversight, yeah, yeah. And

Speaker 2  32:14
then the other one, Matt was the the saw multiplier, yes, refreshment,

Matthias Miller  32:24
on the base. So when you set up the item, you say, here's the total yield quantity, all right. And then we work backwards from there to figure out what the saw, I mean, that's the saw two yield. And so if you put in a multiplier, so if saw two doubles the output, then we take it and we're generating 10 pieces. Then it'll say the saw one yields, sorry, if it generates 10 pieces. And if then, then saw one yields five. And if the saw one generates, oh, this is a bad number, but if the saw one doubles it, then we then the raw material quantities two and a half, all right? And so the the quantity is always the yield quantity. The saw multiplier just helps you kind of go backwards to what's the raw material quantity?

Speaker 2  33:11
All right? So that would be the multiplier. Would be what, what we've initially started out as, or would that be the like, if we

Matthias Miller  33:18
split it, it's if you split it. So if you say, alright, so like we're looking at one on the pent, if it's used as a cleaner, you don't have a multiplier. But if you if using it to split, then you'll put in a two. If it doubles the number of if everything gets split in half, then you'll put into two. If it gets split into thirds, you put in three. So you're just putting in how many, how many pieces it splits into?

Speaker 2  33:44
Alright, I got it. Yeah, I knew you we did something there, but it was like, it's been so

Matthias Miller  33:51
once I get,

Unknown Speaker  33:52
once I get spinning, Obi,

Matthias Miller  33:56
it's one of the it's, yeah, you bet. Thanks, George.

Speaker 1  34:02
Hey, man, HEY George. Well, it's subsided. So I mean, what? I need an anonymous phone call or what do you I'm, I'll call him. He's, it's not going through right now. Let me get Yeah,

Speaker 2  34:22
in trouble for burning down there. But it's like, all my guys out there,

Speaker 1  34:26
like, do you want to go out and talk? Just walk up there and talk to him, see what he tells you. I mean, like, right now, just be like, hey, my guys are getting smoked out of the shop down here. They'll respect they'll respect you more than maybe, yeah, crazy uncle. Crazy uncle's burning his trash again.

Matthias Miller  34:48
Oh, it's your it's your uncle. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  34:50
it's my uncle. And he burned. He'll burn like these guys put like, you know, composite decking and plastic and. You whatever, Amish idiots like you're just people at all and just a lack of light. I don't even know what to say anyway, lack

Matthias Miller  35:25
of a stunt that's the word,

Speaker 1  35:30
how much people can have a sense of entitlement to can

Matthias Miller  35:37
fascinating study. People say young people are entitled. Studies show, based on, I forget the guy's name, but that entitlement actually runs is actually just as strong across all generations as it is in the young people. So there's your little rant.

Unknown Speaker  35:54
That's definitely true.

Unknown Speaker  35:57
All

Speaker 1  35:59
right, so should we like this doesn't really make a big difference right now, this moment, right how we do? But if we, if we go to setup time, no, it doesn't. It's not going to affect much at all, right, right now,

Matthias Miller  36:18
and we're, do you want me to go ahead and have him put in. I could have him in the short term. We could, we could store downtime as a start and end time, and kind of treat it like setup time, in which we, we spread it out however long it needs to be to get to that downtime minutes. And then we, we start moving towards, yeah, getting that from the guys,

Speaker 1  36:46
they're going to be, yeah, if he has downtime in there, now, it's going to be the same for both individuals, or all three. If they're on a machine, like three guys on a machine, they are going to claim the same downtime, okay,

Matthias Miller  37:08
but you do want at least at some point. Doesn't have to be immediate, but at some point getting this starting at times for downtime.

Speaker 1  37:15
Yeah, that's, that's a big goal. I'd say it's a, definitely a big goal. So

Matthias Miller  37:22
do you? Yeah, what's all right? Seems to me like the easiest step is to start putting, start having a way to track down time as start and end times, still letting him put it in as minutes. And we'll just, we'll just figure out when we think the downtime is that it applies to everybody, or something like that. I'll see if there's a not complicated way to do it, but see if we can do a little bit of a hybrid solution, where he can keep putting minutes in, we store it as start and end time, and then you can start getting this information from the shop, and we can start making him put it in at start and end time. Okay, what is that? Does that seem reasonable, or is that overkill?

Unknown Speaker  38:08
No, I think I'll just No. Or

Matthias Miller  38:15
what's would also be easier, probably actually would be easier is if you could get a shop guys to start giving you start and end times right

Speaker 1  38:22
now. We didn't add it to the form we we need to add that to their their production pay papers. It's what we call them. I think it needs to be added to there. And they need to be told. Or do they need to do it now, like they need to start doing it right away. So that's, here's

Matthias Miller  38:44
what I'm gonna do. We're gonna add certain end times, like we do for breaks. And then we're also going to have a number, field number where you can put in untracked downtime. Untracked downtime goes out equally to everybody the start and end times gets distributed the way it needs to be. And then as soon as the shop guys are live, that keeps it super simple. We got a way to deal with all the historical data. And then as soon as you start requiring the shop guys to put it in, then we we take away John's ability to put in just an actual number, and we make him put it in and start in touch.

Unknown Speaker  39:17
Okay, yep, all right, that'll work. Okay. Hey, John, you got a minute? No, that's fine. No, it's fine. 215 is good. We're going over production tracker stuff here we

Speaker 1  39:42
I'll fill you in, best I'll fill you in. And hopefully we like to start using this today, this platform today for assembly tracking. Are the guys giving you on downtime? Are they giving you the start of their downtime and the end of. Their downtime? Are they just writing down minute quantities?

Speaker 1  40:10
Oh, okay, perfect. Because we're going to, we're going to spot the downtime. Yeah, I know. But we're going to start entering as start time and end time of the downtime. If you have it, if you don't have that, then the minutes just get spread out by the guys on the job, like it gets divided around amongst two guys or three guys. All right, I'll catch you soon. All right, Matt, all right. It's got to be simple. All right. Um,

Speaker 1  40:51
so anyway, are we, I think I get how this works. I mean, that's it. I mean,

Matthias Miller  40:58
and then, and then, if you actually have orders, it'll auto assign, like we talked about, order, assign it to the sales order, yes, yes. And it'll show you how much was ordered, how much was needed, how much is still left on that order, and how much they assembled. And if you do something like crazy, you actually can't over produce for an order. If you did over produce, you just need to. It'll just put in a blank row, like it is here, and it's not assigned to an order. And I think we need to think through a little bit how to do deal with that. And then let me make a note of that. But I think basically what we need to do then is probably, when the next order comes in, give John a way to go back and say, All right, we over produce now. Now, here's the here's the order that this, these over produce items go to.

Speaker 1  41:50
That would work, yeah, it obviously be very handy if that would show up when the next order hits, the hits the trail. Um,

Matthias Miller  42:07
well, we could,

Speaker 1  42:10
here's one way we could do it doesn't happen very often, but yeah, we

Matthias Miller  42:15
could add a minus row, a negative assembly quantity. So if you save this and the next time you do we would do negative 11 assembly with a blank order, and it would assign it to the to the new Order Quantity. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  42:39
Is that pretty simple?

Matthias Miller  42:41
I think so. Okay.

Matthias Miller  42:52
Kind of feel like there's some nuance here as we switch and go live and start tracking these, these against orders. But I

Unknown Speaker  43:03
would you say against

Matthias Miller  43:05
orders, like when we start, yeah, when we start saying, this is, this was assembled for this order, there's going to be a little bit of cleanup and possibly finagling that we need to do as we go, go live with that. But,

Unknown Speaker  43:24
yeah,

Matthias Miller  43:28
yeah, I don't really, I'm not sure it's worth putting a ton of thought into it until we get like, I

Speaker 1  43:37
mean, we can, we could ignore it completely and just, just don't ever let entries go over the order quantity, and we just deal it in house. We deal with it. I mean, that's what we've always done before. You know, just like, set those five out on the dock and then, you know, sticky note on his it's not a it's nothing that ever comes up or, you know, I mean, it's not like something we've it's not a problem that we've or Whatever. It's not disruptive or, you know, it's very minor, very minor, like we have much bigger, much bigger fish to fry than that. Okay, good to know. Okay, cool, um, can we, can I try some reports? Then next here, yes,

Matthias Miller  44:40
let's try some reports. Just close without saving or whatever. Just go to the menu, go somewhere else.

Unknown Speaker  44:49
Sure sounds good.

Matthias Miller  44:55
We have the assembly analysis report for the assembly. Reporting, and then you have the score tracker or the score calculator for the scoring itself.

Speaker 1  45:08
All right, let's look at that. Wrote, wick four feet, weight ports, weight fastener, weight 10. I

Matthias Miller  45:24
We are still missing. Let's see. Where did we leave this? I think, I think you were, you were going to chase down some faster pricing.

Speaker 1  45:33
I Yes, did you get it? Man, I don't know if they finished that. Let me check all right.

Unknown Speaker  45:58
So Matt, I have a feeling that didn't happen. That's the key, right there. Man,

Matthias Miller  46:04
that's the Yeah, and that's why those are orange. No.

Speaker 1  46:08
Like, if we will try, we'll start with that right as a multiplier.

Matthias Miller  46:13
Yeah, we can. I'll just need to work with you. I think the best option in my mind is I have So this week's a little crazy. We have VBS this week. We, we, we had 250 kids show up last night. Wow, let's go. I know my wife, this is anyway, my wife's having small, not panic attacks. But you know, it's just makes this stuff work, and yet she's not going to say no to more kids. It's like, so, so that's that is eating up my time. I also have a private like, two days tomorrow and Wednesday are blocked out, and I'm out Friday. So

Speaker 1  46:58
good. So I met her. I'll call and I'll talk to the photo

Speaker 2  47:05
went down through the woods, so I'm not erupting the

Speaker 1  47:09
river Lee. That's river Lee, yeah. Do you the faster prices are those? Is that list finished? Okay, either do

Speaker 2  47:23
the orange or do that. I mean, I can't do whatever. No

Speaker 1  47:26
one thing at a time. We have Matt, you said, you said, this

Matthias Miller  47:31
week's that was a long way to wait to say this week. I'm I'm basically beyond this, this call that we have here, I'm out this

Speaker 1  47:38
week, right? So we'll get that stuff this week, Matt, and then we enter, Okay, thanks, George, um, let me, yeah. I'll, Matt, I'll go in here. Can I come in here and change these costs? Right? Anytime you go up

Matthias Miller  47:57
in the menu and you go into configure fasteners,

Unknown Speaker  48:04
advanced, advanced,

Matthias Miller  48:09
bottom left, configure fasteners right there, and just put them in here.

Speaker 1  48:20
Boom, let's go, Okay, sounds good, and then go back here. And then we need

Matthias Miller  48:26
to talk through about how the multipliers work. Or, I guess actually that would be, that would be a change I would need to make. Do you want to get rid of the do you want this to be score times cost as the score

Speaker 1  48:43
on the fasteners, let me go to the page again here

Matthias Miller  48:48
score calculator,

Matthias Miller  48:57
like it would be One for one for one for machine two for for hand times the cost of the tote times the and is it the cost, the total cost?

Unknown Speaker  49:08
Say this again. Say that again. Sorry. One

Matthias Miller  49:10
for so, so you start with with one for one for machine two for hand times two. Number of fasteners times price per fastener times the fastener weight the point, point one

Unknown Speaker  49:36
man times fastener quantity

Matthias Miller  49:42
times times individual fastener. Price,

Speaker 1  49:44
times faster. Price, yeah, times

Matthias Miller  49:49
the fastener. Weight, which is a 0.1

Unknown Speaker  49:57
times faster? Weight, yeah. I.

Speaker 1  50:05
Um, so how do I change those? How well the machine or the hand that one or one machine to hand, where are we getting that from? That's

Matthias Miller  50:17
on the fastener itself. With fastener itself has a score. Each faster has a score, which we put in one or two.

Speaker 1  50:27
Is that what we did? Or did we change it to a bunch of other numbers, just one or two, the

Matthias Miller  50:33
other numbers are sort order.

Speaker 1  50:37
Do we need that one or I'm just trying to think it would need that one or two. I don't think we do, after we have this other data, are

Matthias Miller  50:46
you? So you're saying that $10 worth of fasteners for machine and $10 worth of fasteners on hand

Speaker 1  50:55
is the same? Possibly, okay? Yeah, like we need to try that.

Matthias Miller  51:03
Do we want to? I guess in my mind, maybe I'm in my mind, why would we change all the fastener scores back down to one, rather than completely getting rid of it right

Unknown Speaker  51:17
away? Sure sounds good. Yep.

Matthias Miller  51:20
Yep. Makes sense. So the biggest thing I need and let me actually see it. Okay, so let me see if this is actually what's working or how it's working. So we have score calculator. We have columns, we have the score, cost of all factors, fasteners, okay, we are not, okay. So I'm not taking the currently. It's only taking the cost and it's not multiple. Well, no, that's fine. This is actually working the way that you want. The fasteners, the score on the fastener itself, it looks like we're ignoring so that doesn't matter. So this is working the way that you want right now. Okay,

Speaker 1  52:22
so board feed, parts, cost of fasteners, yeah, okay. Would you say we're not there? Yeah, there's no fasteners. There's no fastener score in there, right,

Matthias Miller  52:41
in the current calculation, right? We are just using the total cost of the fasteners for the for the score. We're not using the fastener score itself.

Unknown Speaker  52:53
That's, and that's, yeah, that's good, which is

Unknown Speaker  52:55
what you want, right, right? Good.

Speaker 1  53:00
Number of parts, weight is probably way too hot, probably too high. I change that right here,

Matthias Miller  53:13
yes,

Speaker 1  53:17
are we? Can we run a mock? Can we run a couple mocks here, if we do this,

Matthias Miller  53:23
usually you can, you can change it and change it easy. Well, currently, you can change it and change it

Unknown Speaker  53:40
back. You have to go 34 now,

Matthias Miller  53:41
yeah, okay. I mean, you're technically you don't have to have them all now, hit save changes up top, top right. Technically you don't have to have them add up to one. But it probably

Speaker 1  54:01
makes sense too. This is accurately reflecting the fastener prices that we already have in there, right?

Matthias Miller  54:09
Yes, except for the orange, we're missing some right,

Speaker 1  54:13
which is fine, yep, um. Now can I go back and look at uh, production a report on a guy or a couple guys.

Matthias Miller  54:23
Yeah, you can now go back into the analysis report. Go hit the menu, production analysis or assembly analysis to this. This can't happen before next week, but if you wanted to, we could give you, we could give you this report and let you change the factors on this report. That could be pretty useful.

Unknown Speaker  54:51
Change the factors on the report,

Matthias Miller  54:53
change the give you a way to override the weights when you're running this report. I. If you just all right. So if you want to run it on, let me not get ahead of myself. So go to team match. Okay, so do you want to run it based on,

Unknown Speaker  55:15
yeah, okay, yes, any team with

Speaker 3  55:24
any of these people, right? And pick my people,

Speaker 1  55:28
right? So now I'm gonna go, man, wait, missing guy, I'm missing Austin.

Unknown Speaker  55:46
See a new guy. No,

Speaker 1  55:50
Austin, Austin. Kelly, a, U, S, T, I N, Kelly, k, e, l, y, I

Matthias Miller  56:06
so either he only did weird items or he wasn't in the list. You know what that I got.

Speaker 1  56:15
He just came on to assembly again, and, good boy, March, I go man in March. In March, he's on again.

Matthias Miller  56:28
But would he have been in the tracker?

Speaker 1  56:31
Yeah, he should have been, yeah, because you just got a recent copy. Um,

Matthias Miller  56:35
let me pull up. Pull up the production tracker here. Sable macros, a, U, S, T, and then what I n? I n, okay. Austin Kelly, k, e, o, I see, I see, I see, I see. Let's do this

Matthias Miller  57:20
here. Can I share my screen? And can we go through these guys quick? Yep, here I'm going to do this so that I could just make it be faster, not take up as much time All right, so Austin Kelly's, I just want to confirm these are all assembly. Benjamin assembly,

Unknown Speaker  57:50
yeah, I

Matthias Miller  57:54
don't know where this Brio comes from. Do you know what that

Speaker 1  57:56
is? Sorry, I'm not even seeing your screen for so

Matthias Miller  58:00
it's taking some time.

Matthias Miller  58:10
Here. I'm gonna, I'm gonna text these to you out there. It comes. Do you see it now? Yep, this, this, Brio. What's that? Is that a person? Oh, that's a that's a customer. That's customer. Brian Thompson, Thompson

Speaker 1  58:26
is a guy, yeah. HF four is a customer. Okay,

Matthias Miller  58:30
here. Sorry I missed this customer. Customer, and I'm gonna guess all of these guys are. I or

Speaker 1  58:43
employees? Yeah, well, White Horse manifold, white oak display, Whitmer, Wolf, Yeager, those are all customers, and

Matthias Miller  58:52
I'm just looking at these right here.

Speaker 1  58:55
Okay, sure, all right, um, Austin Kelly, that second e should be taken out of that name. Okay, yeah, oh, come

Matthias Miller  59:16
on. Oh, that is that is an issue. Austin. I

Speaker 1  59:36
uh, there's another one up here, if you don't wind up farther Israel Fisher, that should be an S instead of IA, right there. I S or, Oh yeah, I.

Speaker 1  1:00:02
Yeah, so if we can look at go back to, if we'll get a reports then, or go back over here, whatever

Matthias Miller  1:00:12
gracious Hang on, we're going to here. I can, I can. I know, I know it needs to be done. I can fix it on my end, but I'm going to need a minute content. Contact first Name, Okay, I'm

Matthias Miller  1:02:41
um, Do you want Levi in as Levi Fisher, Levi M Fisher,

Speaker 1  1:02:48
well, Levi M Fisher, because we have a Levi K Fisher,

Matthias Miller  1:02:53
is the Levi Fisher without an M? Is he a K?

Unknown Speaker  1:02:57
Right? Well,

Matthias Miller  1:03:02
boy, you don't know it

Speaker 1  1:03:04
might be this either without an M and with an M might be, might be the same guy.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:11
What the world

Speaker 1  1:03:13
I'm gonna have to you? Better leave it sit for a minute. Leave that one, sit off and get back to you. Is that alright? Yeah, that's fine. Oh, crackers.

Matthias Miller  1:03:24
There's always stuff like this. I hate it, but

Unknown Speaker  1:03:27
that's insane.

Matthias Miller  1:03:31
That was this. Why is this not showing up in here? This is a customer. That's dumb, Levi. He's being asleep. I am. All right, so we got now, all right, so we have a Levi Fisher, and we don't know how much of this stuff is actually leave, if there's any Levi K and leave, or if it's Levi anyway, that's fun. Okay, good. So all right, now you go back in your list, you've got everything.

Speaker 1  1:03:56
All right, so what I do? I gotta go back, share again. Yes. All right,

Unknown Speaker  1:04:12
okay,

Matthias Miller  1:04:18
and then you would hit your employee, select your employees.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:23
Yes,

Speaker 1  1:04:31
I might need to update this, or, I don't know, let me try this.

Matthias Miller  1:04:36
Right? Yes, you're right.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:42
Well, what if I want just the individual? They just pick one, okay, and

Matthias Miller  1:04:49
then group by in your grouping, decide whether you want to you know, do you want to be customer? Do you want it by team? Do you want it by employee? Do. So this will show, yeah, there you go.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:19
Oh, we have

Matthias Miller  1:05:22
and here's when Dave's working with this is Austin, Anytime he's working, if you go down, then we've got Dave when he's working with Austin.

Speaker 1  1:05:39
So what if I just like to look at Austin and a smaller window, if I can't, like, shoot,

Matthias Miller  1:05:54
like, when he's working by himself, yeah, So just

Speaker 1  1:06:00
hit, even if he's working with others, like, what's his score? What's his score on, say, burger versus anybody else.

Matthias Miller  1:06:10
So then, do hit any? Okay. Employees hit Austin, the primary grouping then could be employee, and the secondary could be customer.

Speaker 1  1:06:42
Yeah, okay, and so I can look at his burger score per hour 1.6 Well, right now his average score per hour is 5.3

Matthias Miller  1:07:00
that's total, right? Yeah, that's, that's the total score divided by total hours. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:07:10
5.3 is his total score. What's a good can Osman 5.7 interesting, Simon's a 5.3

Matthias Miller  1:07:31
No, that's a grand total. Simon's a 3.90

Unknown Speaker  1:07:36
so Wait is this?

Matthias Miller  1:07:38
This is anytime Simon is working with, oh,

Speaker 1  1:07:42
that's what it is. That's it. So what if I just want to look at Austin's score period?

Matthias Miller  1:07:51
Then that's just the 5.3

Unknown Speaker  1:07:55
and this is all of his work.

Matthias Miller  1:07:57
That is all of his work. Then if I go back,

Unknown Speaker  1:07:59
which you can

Matthias Miller  1:08:02
hit the title up there, up top if you want. Or you can go back here if you hit the forward button, yeah, and click the assembly Analysis Report, drop down or not, yep, yep. And then you can just, you can just change the change

Speaker 1  1:08:19
employee, so he's a 5.3 I'm gonna say, what is Julio? Well, what shown combined or not?

Matthias Miller  1:08:32
No, it'll show anytime. It'll show Austin and Julio and anybody who works with them.

Speaker 1  1:08:39
Okay? So I want Austin, Julio. I want Cairo. I want Brian. I want Simon, Steve, real, Steve Byler, Yoni,

Speaker 1  1:09:12
I'm assuming it's going to show those guys in order before it shows other guys that were working with them. It's

Matthias Miller  1:09:17
not it's just going to be alphabetic order. Basically, was working

Unknown Speaker  1:09:22
of them working with each other, or, yeah, it's

Matthias Miller  1:09:24
anybody working with those guys. We need another drop list option that says individual. I only want to look at individuals, yeah,

Speaker 1  1:09:34
so I can go back so Austin, he's still a 5.3 Augustine, correct to Benjamin. This is still a good comp. Benjamin is a 4.5 Brian is 6.9 Yeah, that makes sense. Ditto. It's not I.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:03
Iro is a 4.6 interesting,

Unknown Speaker  1:10:16
he's a 6.0 I'm

Unknown Speaker  1:10:23
Hmm, I guess 5.1

Unknown Speaker  1:10:26
Osmond, 6.1 Paul, 6.3 interesting. I

Unknown Speaker  1:10:44
ah, it's just interesting to see some of this. Yani is 5.8 Come on.

Matthias Miller  1:10:59
So how close is it to reflecting see in real world? Obviously, it's still not complete.

Speaker 1  1:11:06
This guy right here, he's wanting to raise pretty bad, but man, I it's, yeah, there's some, there's definitely some, there's some, there's some indicators that match, if you will. I know we have to clean this up yet. So okay,

Matthias Miller  1:11:25
well, for somebody like Austin, you can say, Look, you can run the report and break it down instead of customer break it down by month and say, Look, your score has consistently been 3.2 or 5.3 Hey, bump it up to six months, to six for three months straight. And and at that point we'll bump you up to this. And if you can hold that for this this period of time, then at this point, we'll bump it up to the next thing, or, you know, whatever. So your secondary grouping, you could put in a,

Matthias Miller  1:11:58
I mean, yeah, fun thing about once you get this stuff, stuff in here, let's see, yep, he's there, and go down to secondary grouping, do it by month, and hit continue. I mean, this isn't, this is an honest conversation. Like it looks like you putting in and assuming your numbers are right. It's a you could say, look, it looks like you've been putting in a lot more effort over the last couple months, right?

Speaker 1  1:12:26
That's right. I like that. And then, yeah, so he's 5.7 5.6 he's bringing his number up, 2025, January. Yeah. I mean, that's not an accurate reflection. But

Matthias Miller  1:12:42
yeah, sure, yeah, all right. Well, I I've got a list of changes to make very unlikely for this to happen this week. Like I said, I'm basically my time spoken for. But I'm hoping this is enough to hoping you have enough that you can start playing around with some of this stuff, and we can start looking at getting

Speaker 1  1:13:05
I'm gonna have to be able to I'm off to learn how to do like, Hey, how's he I can compare when he works with this guy, this guy, this guy and that guy. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:13:15
just go up to the assembly report, assembly analysis report, and just change the primary grouping from employee to team.

Speaker 1  1:13:23
Okay, what if I do employee to item right? And then,

Matthias Miller  1:13:29
and then item to and then secondary team, secondary team, maybe, I mean, I'm just saying, let's, let's take a look at it. The team is what you're looking at when with how he's working with other people, true. No, you need to know, find out how he's personally doing. You need a primary grouping of team and a secondary grouping of employee. So here's the team, then here's the employee, and then hit continue,

Speaker 1  1:14:02
but I want to look at item. That's okay. Well, if you want to

Matthias Miller  1:14:06
look at item, then that's that's different. If you want to look at how he does within a team, fair enough. Do you need a third level of grouping, potentially, like here you can see

Unknown Speaker  1:14:20
Austin, Dave, 5.7 this is machine.

Matthias Miller  1:14:26
Oh, I get what you're saying.

Speaker 1  1:14:28
Awesome. Osmond, 5.7 Austin Simon, not very good. They were 3.9 so, yeah, we don't want to put them together anyway. We already know that. Yeah, I'm saying him with a item like versus other people working on the same item, like his score on this item, versus, yeah, right. Can I do that?

Matthias Miller  1:14:53
Yes, I think this is what you want, right here. So then you have HF 11. Okay, all right. This is an interesting question too, because Austin might be good at right, ar 419 and never put him on the 416 or maybe it's a product problem. Or maybe it's like, yeah, maybe there's just certain projects he does better with.

Speaker 1  1:15:17
Yeah, we just, we have to clean up that stuff with that score, because that's definitely construing it a lot. If I look at say, here we go. Is this one he worked with this guy when he Oh, no wait.

Matthias Miller  1:15:30
So this is anytime Austin was working on, anytime Austin was working on bird three and a half, 3.5 this is his score versus the other guys at score that he worked with, yes, he worked with with these other guys, and this is their, their scores working together. Now,

Unknown Speaker  1:15:52
it's interesting stuff. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:15:56
Now, if you wanted to, you could show this for everybody and say, Show me. Show me all the numbers for everybody, and go see who does the best work on Berg 3.5 right? Or you could filter by Berg 3.5 that actually be an interesting thing. Go filter by Berg 3.5 on the, on the, on the items list

Unknown Speaker  1:16:17
on the top. Oh, okay, yes.

Matthias Miller  1:16:19
Go down to actually hit customers first and hit burger.

Unknown Speaker  1:16:25
Oh, gosh, yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:16:29
yep. And then, and then you'll be able to select the 3.5 if you want to look at just 3.5 it's still not okay. Forget that. We'll show the burger. But then then do a primary grouping of well, then then in the team match. Just blank out the team match

Unknown Speaker  1:16:50
right here, yeah, so we're

Matthias Miller  1:16:52
going to look at anybody who's worked on burger stuff at any time, group by item and employee. So now run this all right, item and employee, that's it. That's it. Hit Continue. Let it crank for a little bit, because it's going to take a minute, right there. Um, so burgers, 3.5 go down to that. Now you can see, right? This is across across the board,

Speaker 1  1:17:18
right? So, Austin, here, John, look at

Matthias Miller  1:17:21
that. But Austin, still he's below average on this because you can see the average one point that nine at the bottom, point

Speaker 1  1:17:26
nine on burger, 3.5 he's at 1.7 Augustine, 2.6 Brian's two.

Matthias Miller  1:17:33
But look at at Julio. He's got a ton of ton of hours tracked, and he's at two. That's pretty telling

Unknown Speaker  1:17:41
how Tim McGee got three points,

Matthias Miller  1:17:44
yeah, but that's just a small that's a small data set. That's part of the issue, right? He didn't clock enough time for it to be

Speaker 1  1:17:51
meaningful, right? Right, right. Burger 3.5 history, this is each guy. Average score is 1.9 Augustine's 2.6 Austin's 1.7 he's below average.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:09
How do you do that when you got two people, you can't you can't go off of one person. When it's a two person job,

Unknown Speaker  1:18:15
it's divided by two.

Matthias Miller  1:18:18
So you you know how much time

Speaker 1  1:18:21
this is. Sorry, John, sorry. Go ahead, Matt. I mean,

Matthias Miller  1:18:24
you know how much time they're working on it, and so, yeah, you might, you might be working with a guy that slows you down, but that's your fault for being slowed down, for working with that guy, or for not picking up the pace. Even if he's working with you, you still have, it's still your output. If you guys both spend an hour working on it.

Speaker 1  1:18:41
Just saying, for all these guys here, John like is the same, the same calculations for everybody. And I'm saying the average is 1.9 beyond he's at two. Walters, 1.8 Steve rills at two, uh, Simon's 1.8 on burger. Look at me. He's done a ton of times. Simon's 1.8 Julio and Steve are two. Geramius is two. Highros 1.9 He's average.

Matthias Miller  1:19:13
But here's where I can dance. Can I just answer a little rant here?

Unknown Speaker  1:19:19
Yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:19:20
go, go talk to Steve. And say, Steve, walk me through how you build the Berg, 3.5 go talk to go talk to Julio. Say, Hey, Julio, want me through how you guys do this and let them put together the go figure out what they're doing differently on why they're doing it so fast, and make that be the process for for assembly. And look if there's process gaps between these guys and how some of the other guys are actually doing it, like, is it a process gap, or is it literally just, hey, we got a fire in our belly and we're going to show up and work and get stuff

Unknown Speaker  1:19:51
done? Yeah, it's probably a process thing, you know?

Matthias Miller  1:19:54
And now you've got a standard. And now, once you start pushing this out, you can on the on the assembly sheets, we could put a target. Good goal. Say, look, if you follow this process, you should be able to hit a 2.0 score on on this right?

Speaker 1  1:20:04
So if we gotta wait, let's go to wave. Wave. We'll get a wave as a customer, and I'll get I gotta eliminate burger out of here. Check it. Wait. We went away. You know,

Matthias Miller  1:20:22
he's fine. It's actually still there. It's, I don't know why it's blank, still there. So

Speaker 1  1:20:27
wave and we're doing item employee, continue. Here we go. So this is all the wave items. What's wave 18? Is that a it's a crate. So average score 11.9 the scores are mixed up, but it's the same for everybody. Like we're same scoring for everybody right now. So right now, with the data that we have, average is 11.9 Augustine's 8.2 he's below average. Austin's a 5.2

Matthias Miller  1:21:03
Benjamin, but he doesn't have a lot of them. What? But, but he hasn't done a lot of them. So it could be or just lack of experience. Brian's

Speaker 1  1:21:15
a 9.9 he did it a lot of it. Benjamin's 21.8 i Eight. Benjamin has a higher score on ways

Speaker 4  1:21:27
that's skewed too, because they probably just made size and ends, and another team made power to assembly, so they're

Speaker 1  1:21:33
getting credit for items. Yeah,

Speaker 4  1:21:39
that's why in my notes, I put sides and ends only or power. So, yeah, two different crews doing

Unknown Speaker  1:21:45
the same job. We didn't, we clean that up. Matt,

Matthias Miller  1:21:48
if it's in notes, I didn't clean it up. But if it was in the quantity, I grouped all those guys together on the on the, yeah, there might be a couple wave orders that that didn't get entered. Was that weight was, wave, the last thing I was waiting for from Tina. Maybe I don't remember,

Unknown Speaker  1:22:03
yeah, that's probably not a factor. But,

Matthias Miller  1:22:07
I mean, it should, shouldn't be enough to Yeah, we had, we have two wave, wave eighteens that are outstanding, that need to be cleaned up. So it could be throwing it off a little bit.

Speaker 1  1:22:17
I have to get a bit. Let me get a better one, Matt, I'll let you go here. But wave. What's a better one? John hand work that everybody does? Everyone like that gets passed around Iron Hill.

Speaker 4  1:22:39
I still do mine? Steal seven.

Speaker 1  1:22:46
Purple, High Steel. Get rid of wave. Let's go.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:53
Or the green of 124,

Unknown Speaker  1:22:55
I serve 10, which will

Unknown Speaker  1:22:57
four? Yeah.

Speaker 1  1:23:02
So here's four average score, 5.2 always seems. Got 13 score. He didn't do it. He's less than an hour. So Austin, less than an hour. He's a 4.9 below average measurement for Brian, 7.5 with that's not a surprise. Jeremy is 5.9 that's not a surprise. Those guys aren't here anymore. Unfortunately, Pyro is a four. Julio, 4.5 Mickey less than a half hour, Miguel's kind of low. Osmond is low. Posh has a really good score. Simon has a really good score. Walter Yani has a good score. That's interesting. Definitely interesting here. Austin's above average with the high serve 20 fours,

Speaker 4  1:23:55
they make the purple all the time. So which one's that

Speaker 1  1:24:02
Austin does, yeah, he's below average. Air again, 4.6 average is 4.9

Unknown Speaker  1:24:15
Benjamin's four. Brian's a 6.4 he was more productive. Does Osmond? Though Osmond, 4.4 Simon 5.6 Steve real, 5.3 Where's Julio? Julio, 5.3 Wow. I It's interesting. Yeah, it's interesting. Matt,

Matthias Miller  1:24:50
okay, so then here's what I love about data. This tells you exactly the types of questions you should be asking out in the shop. Yeah, all right, what are you doing differently? I. Show me how you do it, yep, how we would get other guys doing it same way,

Unknown Speaker  1:25:04
right, right, right.

Matthias Miller  1:25:08
Good stuff, man. We're happy to see this, right,

Speaker 1  1:25:11
right, right. All right. We'll get this. I'll get that, those prices in there for the and then you'll do your thing, whatever. We'll reconnect. I it. But Matt, if I, if I clean up the prices, I'm already, what am I doing here? I'm already going to be like, if I enter the correct fastener prices, and we already adjusted the scoring method, I can, I can play with this this week. Oh yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:25:43
yeah, there's nothing stopping you from playing around with it. And yep, yep. All right, man, cool. Appreciate it.

Unknown Speaker  1:25:49
Yeah, thanks a lot. Bye.
