Unknown Speaker  15:45
Hey, dude saw

Unknown Speaker  15:48
sorry. I took a minute

Matthias Miller  15:50
now, good, um, I don't we sure would have got um,

Matthias Miller  16:03
I excluded anything that did not have any fasteners or specifically said in the description that it's a kit. Yeah, so I don't know if you just want to look like some of these are wildly off. Some of them are close. I was trying to think of some of the factors that could be affecting it. These are just low quantities that could just be hard to get right.

Speaker 1  16:30
Well before we get too crazy, like in the what is that report with the shows the discrepancy between invoice and quantity assembled. Like, there's, I mean, over a quarter of those are 100% off. So that's gonna, I mean, like, our data, isn't

Matthias Miller  16:55
it's really bad. Wow. Well, I mean, you look at some of these, and you start drilling in like here they did 430 and it took them 1415, hours. Here they did, sorry,

Speaker 1  17:11
let me get rid of this. What's going on? Close that. Okay. Go ahead, Matt, what are you saying? What am I doing here? What are you saying?

Matthias Miller  17:22
Like, here they did, they did three HF, one right here. Can you see my screen

Speaker 1  17:28
just barely at the bottom here? Let me here. Oops. What am I allowed to move? If you move, then I Okay, yeah, I see that.

Matthias Miller  17:40
So, like here they made 306 hours. Here, it took him 15 hours to make 439

Speaker 1  17:48
hours to make 600 hang on my on my screen is goofy here, then I got it. What's this now? 300 in 306

Matthias Miller  17:57
hours, 430 and 15 hours, 609 hours. 130 in the 18 hours, like there's no way this is right.

Speaker 1  18:10
Hang on. I still can't see all. I'm sorry. I just can't see everything on my screen. It's at the bottom of my

Matthias Miller  18:16
screen. You can't move it around.

Speaker 1  18:21
It goes in leaps and bounds, kind of ish, but no, there we go. There we go. Okay, I'm sorry, got it now, 600 and is there a fraction, or some percentage, or something, 305 430, and well, I mean, it depends who made them. But 103

Matthias Miller  18:44
100 and ones. You really think they would take 18 hours to make? 130

Speaker 1  18:49
that's all. Those are all. 30 266, 3672 I mean, I don't know how go back and look at it. No. 18 hours. 130, absolutely not. 10, 592,

Unknown Speaker  19:02
300 304 hours. I mean, we should go look at it.

Matthias Miller  19:09
But like using, using this model, basically what the model does is it has, I um, it has multipliers based on board feet, number of parts and the individual multipliers for each of the fasteners. And then it also has an adjustment for large batches. And so the bigger the batch, there's some efficiency gain, and that's based on those, the board, feet parts, and quantity, batch size. So you can see here, this calculation comes out way differently for the HF one.

Speaker 1  19:56
What is that? Top calculation?

Matthias Miller  19:59
I. This is the total estimated assembly time for every time we did it. This is the total actual assembly time.

Unknown Speaker  20:08
Hang on estimated time.

Matthias Miller  20:12
This is what we should think. This is what the model thinks. So what we think using this formula that it should have taken us on this particular thing, on this particular thing. Now, obviously, I find it hard to believe. I mean, maybe, maybe we're just four times too slow, but who knows? HF 10? There's, it's a little closer, but it's still a ways off HF 11, a ways off, HF 12, HF 13, but we get to the HF two, and all of a sudden our prediction is within about 4% Wow.

Matthias Miller  20:57
Well, and then HF three, we're within 20% 21% but then there are some really goofy things here, like five hours and 28 hours. Like, what the world's that

Unknown Speaker  21:13
it's an entry issue.

Speaker 1  21:21
I'm kicking, kicking myself that he ever did it me, he shouldn't be doing any entries period. I mean, I think what's now, he's, I mean, he was like, Hey, thanks for coming, Matt. Then later, he's like, Man, I really think that helped. Now's that evening, and then, and then, like, today again, he's like, I think I got it now, like, he's like, attaching it to the right Armstrong load, telling me how he there was two from this week loads, but they got canceled, so he caught it and he attached him to next week's loads, one of those going to get canceled and all that And but I'm in the history, like, there is, I just everything I look at, there's mistakes there. One they did one all day instead of 116 so I go back to the so I have to go back to the paper copies and fix stuff. I mean, you could spend days and weeks doing that. Yeah, you could. But, I mean, I can task Amanda with it. I mean, I mean, we'll do it just for the sake of because I want accurate data. I don't want crap data. Is there value in historical because, well, one thing, we don't have a real big sample size in this system, so let's at least make sure what we have is pretty clean, right?

Matthias Miller  22:44
Yeah, I wonder if there'd be a way to find the worst outliers.

Unknown Speaker  22:47
Like, if we would do, I'm seeing it right here, right?

Matthias Miller  22:52
Like, let's do let me, let me, let me. Let me. Do this. Let's do something. Like, I

Speaker 1  23:04
Well, it's also the ones that don't match. It's the ones that don't match the sales order quantity.

Matthias Miller  23:11
Well, yeah, well,

Speaker 1  23:12
that's only for but, yeah, that could be time entry mistakes too. Well, there is. It's both.

Matthias Miller  23:17
I mean, like, if you look at here, we're we're ranging from one to four like, well, this is pretty bad. But, I mean, you could do a report where it shows, show me every order based on how far it is off the median or the average one of those. And start looking, start cleaning up the like double checking on the really terrible ones, like this guy, yeah, this is just insanity.

Speaker 1  23:49
All right, 10, 592, here we go. Hang on. It's be there in a second. I'm going a long way here. Hold on.

Unknown Speaker  24:04
Work Order search

Matthias Miller  24:07
not by work order ID you can search for. Ah, what's that you can search for? Ah, f1,

Unknown Speaker  24:17
wait, 10, 592, is not in here.

Matthias Miller  24:23
It's historical. Oh, are they? This isn't something where we'd have see this guy, 460

Speaker 1  24:41
I'm not with you or what I'm looking in, I'm looking in the tracker. Oh, good.

Speaker 1  24:53
Well, I'm still not finding 10, 592, Matt, I was looking for. A couple today. The ones that you said were Sunday entries. I couldn't find those either.

Matthias Miller  25:10
Show historical work orders.

Matthias Miller  25:18
Take the tab off the end. I don't know. No, 10, five. That doesn't matter for you. That's me pasting it in.

Unknown Speaker  25:26
You see it? Trying for it?

Speaker 1  25:30
Yep. Is it in the tracker? Yep. Why am I not finding I'm at 10, 147, 10, 150, then it goes to 12, 718,

Speaker 2  25:42
are you? Jocely? Go back farther. It's um, it's for 228,

Unknown Speaker  25:49
oh, shoot, that's why

Matthias Miller  25:55
is the HF one. What kind of palette is that?

Speaker 1  25:58
I think it's a machine palette, pretty sure, 228, that's way back.

Unknown Speaker  26:09
I know the wrong way.

Matthias Miller  26:20
Okay, sorry. I guess I could have given you the sage order number. You could have looked it up from there,

Speaker 1  26:26
but oh yeah. Well, 28 Yeah, those numbers are, how do I quickly find them? Well, we might need a shortcut for that. That's fair. 10, 590, that's a flag. 10, 592, what do we say they did was that the right 110, 592, what's it say?

Unknown Speaker  26:51
There they did. They assembled 132

Matthias Miller  27:03
Wait a minute. Why is the other part of it not showing up?

Unknown Speaker  27:10
228, there's a link.

Matthias Miller  27:19
Quantity assembled. 130 for this guy,

Unknown Speaker  27:24
there's a link in in the work order.

Matthias Miller  27:29
Why did it get switched out to 130 items? Because I had changed it to 620 at some point, Amanda changed it from from assembling 620 to assembling it to 130

Unknown Speaker  27:44
Amanda did, yep, how, what boy? How would that? Why would that happen? I don't

Matthias Miller  27:57
know. She switched it to she assigned it to a sales order, and it changed the quantity to the sales order quantity.

Speaker 2  28:05
When was Amanda doing it? I don't even September 15, 4:26pm,

Speaker 1  28:18
Drew did the here's a question up there in the notes, it says 460, plus 160, Eagle, 620, right?

Matthias Miller  28:25
That was me. That was when we were combining partials.

Speaker 1  28:28
Okay, so I was looking at some of the New Holland stuff, and it says the same thing. And then that got changed. Some of those got changed out, and they attached to one sales order, and then the quantity completed changed, and then never and then it never got corrected, and it got saved like that, yep. And then John said, all those ones that say this plus that equals that, or this plus this plus this equals that. He said, those. None of those were him. He said, but there's a bunch of those that have mistakes in

Unknown Speaker  29:08
what was Amanda do? What was she

Unknown Speaker  29:12
Oh, no, dang it.

Matthias Miller  29:15
We can see what else she was doing. September 15, I

Matthias Miller  29:27
uh, see what other work order she was changing. She was tying out something.

Matthias Miller  29:46
What was she cleaning up? Was she tying out? She was trying to tie up sales orders.

Speaker 1  29:53
I guess she was involved. But I. I didn't know if she was that involved.

Matthias Miller  30:08
See that one stayed right 260

Matthias Miller  30:18
I mean the 620 numbers is really close to what I mean that that puts it in the ballpark. Assembly time in the ballpark.

Speaker 1  30:29
Well, that 10, 592, was attached to another work order that was, I'm trying to find it here. One, on the 27th there it is. Dave Michael Mel. Dave Michael 1875, then there's a 12708, that doesn't have any any entries that don't make sense. They did 460, in the notes, but none in the completed they work for pretty good part of the day.

Matthias Miller  31:11
Well, that's because I moved it over to the other Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I that one is 431 35 430 and 135 60. So we lost about 60 in the count. And for some reason, I How did it let it? Oh, this is a nightmare

Speaker 1  31:49
that did 900 total from 226, to 227, then it connected to the 228, entry to

Matthias Miller  32:10
this guy, What's this guy's ID,

Unknown Speaker  32:18
1874 and the guy's up here,

Matthias Miller  32:25
so it's double counted.

Unknown Speaker  32:36
Well,

Matthias Miller  32:50
part of the issue is that we should not allow she changed. She changed the one partial into a non partial while it was still linked. So we should have made her. Oh, come on.

Matthias Miller  33:20
I would expect this guy, did we never add that validation? Okay? Well, that's part of the issue. We can click. We can get that cleaned up.

Matthias Miller  33:34
Here's one where we did 200 and less than an hour.

Speaker 1  33:47
But there's a bunch of stuff like this Matt, where it's just screwed up. They were

Matthias Miller  33:52
down for 105 minutes. I'll bet you, if you take the 105 and put it back in there one well, even that's not quite right, yeah, it would be two more hours because it's two guys, Two point, and that gets us up into the ballpark.

Matthias Miller  34:42
Have a those look weird. Maybe that one too, not sure about this one. I.

Unknown Speaker  35:10
So if we would, if we

Matthias Miller  35:21
would do something like this,

Unknown Speaker  35:24
we have a work order.

Unknown Speaker  35:33
Yeah, I mean, we can look at the outliers for

Matthias Miller  35:37
based on on quantity per item. Oh, no, ma'am, it's

Unknown Speaker  35:49
late on a Friday.

Matthias Miller  35:50
Yeah, it's fair.

Speaker 1  35:53
No, I'm sorry, dude, I want to really get into this stuff. I'm not trying to be up. No,

Matthias Miller  35:57
it's, it's fine. It's, it's late on Friday. I get it. Well, what do we need for? What do we need in the immediate for burger and or, sorry Remy.

Unknown Speaker  36:14
Well, biggest problem is we're using number two at 685,

Speaker 1  36:24
I found some number two this morning at 61 cents. Right down the road, there's number three available for 44 cents or better. That company that gave us the better price in twos is getting us a price on threes. If those prices are about what it sounds like, that gets us back in the ballpark of maybe making profit on some of these things. Yep. But I mean, Rick dropped the ball in the int 1020s he admitted that, but that's a couple $100,000 mistake over three years.

Unknown Speaker  37:07
Yeah. I

Speaker 1  37:10
mean, they've been pricing it at 58 cents, or whatever, at at inch and a half by three and a half. The original price it that thing's 844, the original price was 1051 that when they submitted it the first time in 2022 1051, we're paying it went anywhere from eight down to seven back up to eight over the last couple years, but we're mostly been in the seven eight range, which so that means, if we're buying cheaper lumber at one point, maybe, but they made a decision, because it can't have bark and heat treated. So if you buy a number three, two by four, it could have bark on the edges, then you got to take a knife and peel off the bark, da, da, because the heat treating requirements, it's, they haven't been like, it's just not working together on it, right? So I guess my possibly the price was the Remy prices may be a little tight some places, but how in the Harry, are we going to are we going to stand here and push back when we don't even know when we don't even have a proper handle on what we want to do. Do we want to use number three? Do more labor? Do we want to use number two? Get the best price? Can we get a better price than number two? Or do we want to go with hardwood wherever possible and deal with stick it in a heat treater on a cart instead of number two by fours that are already heat treated don't have to go in a heat treat, just stamp them. So that's easier. But at 68 cents versus whatever a board foot or it's actually two by fours actually come out to 90 some sense, because it's two by four count versus 50 some cent, you know? Oh, well, it's easier than putting them other ones, and are you we don't like, what the

Matthias Miller  39:05
Well, I mean, the answer is, sorry.

Speaker 1  39:08
I mean, this is like, some you missed some, I'm sorry for the mess. Oh, it's

Matthias Miller  39:11
fine. It's fine. The answer is, let's run, let's, let's run the estimates on all three, like on, on the different approaches, and let's figure out where each one comes out.

Speaker 1  39:20
At Rick got price. He gave me a price for number two, high, number two, low, the hardwood and number three, on a couple different jobs. And it, it's, that's where you start. I'm just

Matthias Miller  39:39
right now, huh? How do you predict the labor differences?

Speaker 1  39:44
I don't know how you did that. Matt, yeah. Oh, the labor, labor differences like using, using, using the poplar instead of the. Two by fours every the lumber needs stripped, layer at a time. Go on, put in the heat treater. So there's more work there. If you use the number three pine versus number two, there's more bark, etc. So there's more waste, then there's more cutbacks. And then with the bark, you have to take knives and knives and peel off the bar. What did you say? How do you predict

Matthias Miller  40:23
that? Like, yeah, like, how much labor is that? I mean, it's adding 5% 20%

Speaker 1  40:27
I can't, I can't sit here, yeah, I don't know. That's a good point. Good point. Probably, I don't know, anywhere from five to 15% maybe, right?

Matthias Miller  40:38
What do we think it adds 15% that's still 12% of over percent of overall cost. It takes your labor costs from 12% to maybe 15%

Speaker 1  40:48
at most. Yeah. I mean the margin, the margin on getting two by fours at 44 cents versus 68 cents allows for a lot of labor. Yeah. So I'm just, I'm pissed because I shouldn't have to deal with it. I mean, I don't want to sound whatever. I'm just, there's so much others anyway,

Matthias Miller  41:14
what? So much other stuff? You're overwhelmed. And it's one more thing,

Speaker 1  41:19
well, but it's, it shouldn't have come to this, but nobody wants to own it. You know, Rick, you know, well, that's Remy pricing. Well, I said, I figured you were watching, looking out, watching over that stuff, is it? They've been sending that over. That's, that's their price. I mean, he just don't want to own up to anything. Man like who wants to take a trip for the he wants credit, but he doesn't want

Unknown Speaker  41:46
to anyway. So

Speaker 1  41:51
I'm this right now. I'm like, okay, he got me the prices. I had to push, I had to push, had to push a couple times. I was like, I'm not gonna say I said it twice on the I asked him to do it two days ago. Wednesday was a Thursday morning, yesterday morning, I asked him to do it yesterday afternoon. I was like, Hey, did you get those numbers? And then he started working on it. What have he got? I don't know. I'm not sure. I have to push him to do stuff, you know, Jeff, I'm just not excited about hitching my wagon to

Unknown Speaker  42:30
kind of Like,

Speaker 1  42:34
anyway, I'm semi I'm preparing myself to just you may figure out the pricing, and let's use that period. But then who's in charge here on the floor? I mean, that's not. How does Rick fit into that picture? I'm not sure. I'm not sure, but I did give him the evaluation papers today. I gave Rick George, John, Michael, and a man Amanda wasn't here, so Tina kind of falls under Rick. So I didn't, didn't for her. But yep, John was supposed to go to a leadership two hours every every other week, for four weeks to leadership lab, just collaborative, leadership training, leadership discussion, networking, a little bit of networking with other leaders. And he backed out today because he said he's got to be on the forklift. And I'm just like, all right. And George is pissed because he's like, he just does whatever he wants. He's like, if you're the president, you should tell him he has to go. But I said, I don't even want to I don't even want him to go anymore. I you know,

Unknown Speaker  44:06
yeah, George was

Speaker 1  44:07
ticked because he didn't make the, you know, around the corner from us when we did the meeting the other day. I won't have time, or all this. And anyway, that's yeah, that's all part of it. But I, I I sat here with, yeah, there's just mistake after mistake and these mistakes, Oh man, I'm just like mistakes and character Bs is just got me like, I'm just sick of it, so I'm trying to weed

Matthias Miller  44:39
it. You keep working with him, and he keeps doing this,

Unknown Speaker  44:44
you mean John? Yeah,

Speaker 1  44:48
I know, but George is, I'm talking to George actively about taking on the operations, all of it, including that John's under him. Where do you need him? Him. No needs. He's gonna need him on the dock, on the forklift. Yeah, that's where we're going with it. Yep, I like it. GEORGE needs to train Cecil to do the cut list so he has more more freedom. Yep, I talked to him again about today, and I started to talk to him about actually, a while ago, but just last week or so, branded by him a couple times. And he's, he's, yeah, he's good with it. And, I mean, at least his he knows how to make the number. I mean, he's, he's accurate, okay. And he's training people. That's another thing. He needs push sometimes, but I don't know I can hit. I mean, I it's not, you know what? I mean, it's not terrible, like the two by 468, cents. I mean, that was George. He's buying these things. Well, I don't know. He does a lot of stuff really well. He does a lot of things like I asked him to do. He sometimes I have to ask him a couple times, like, when it's follow up on a issue with somebody or something like that, he's kind of, sometimes he kind of drags his feet on that stuff a little bit. He doesn't, I don't know, but just depends. I mean, he can be a little moody, but man, overall, he's, he's the best I got, and he knows everything. He knows all of it. Yep, that's where I'm with John, with Rick. I mean, I just need, I mean, I don't need a lot of reason at this point. I just, I guess I'm gonna see how he responds here. I mean, you got the review, got this evaluation process. I mean, I gave him a paper. You know, when we come to the place where he talks about what he all does, he asks if he can have another piece of can I have another sheet of paper? Naturally? That's was his

Matthias Miller  47:06
comment. By all means. I

Speaker 1  47:08
said you can bring a notebook, man. So I'm just, I'm I just need a reason. I just need a I mean, once. I mean, okay, I'm gonna run it. I want to run this out. Keep pushing me, man, as I'm gonna run this out. If I want, I did I show you the paper. I didn't show you. I want. I told you. I told you. I want this sales. I want design, pricing, sales, all under one like I want one person to take charge of all of that, and if he can't do it, then I'm going to find somebody else that can do it. And I don't care who it is and where he come I mean, yeah, we're going to get a good person. He's going to cost a lot of money, and it's going to affect Rick's pay, yeah.

Matthias Miller  47:58
So when you say pricing, it means that means, like the this is different from a sale, sales role. This is, this is

Speaker 1  48:11
you and I are building the pricing thing, right? Yep, we just go build a shiny tool and plop it in Rick's lap. Is it that for him?

Matthias Miller  48:26
I mean, it can be, but then, well, I mean, I'm not saying it should be. I'm saying

Matthias Miller  48:36
I just want to, I'm not trying to say. I'm just trying to clarify. I I mean, we, whoever that is, is not responsible for coming up with the pricing model, or are they responsible for coming up with the pricing

Speaker 1  48:48
model? No. Okay, now, I guess it's a good point. I mean,

Matthias Miller  48:53
because somebody needs to be in charge of controlling cost and make making sure that we do control costs, that prices stay up to date, but building the system for it is a different thing. And at the point that I mean what you're It depends what you're saying, I'm not sure that a I think it takes somebody like a George to or you or something like that, to actually do the design. But once you have the design, you plug it in, theoretically, we should be able to come up with a good price, right?

Speaker 1  49:33
Tina. Tina is the one that's responsible for design, but she gets help from George, a lot on, on the hard stuff and but Tina's under Rick, Tina's under Rick. So right? I want, I just, I want, I want it taken care of. And I want to be like we need to be able to be creative and make whatever people want. And.

Unknown Speaker  50:00
And, yeah, I mean,

Speaker 1  50:04
Tina and Rick aren't gonna, you know, they're getting by, but they're not. They're not building, they're not. There's no innovation, none.

Matthias Miller  50:15
Well, there's no system. I mean, there's no system to it, like there's

Speaker 1  50:22
no they're just using the old stuff. They're just using the same old tools, and they're just using other prints to re hat like they're using other prints and just plugging in different numbers and some of that as much as they can. Yeah, what they're doing. So you're right, it's sales, sales, pricing design.

Unknown Speaker  50:57
Yeah, I don't know.

Unknown Speaker  51:02
Guess I'm thinking about that little role. But I mean, I want a person in house that,

Speaker 1  51:13
I mean, I want a good person here that can do design and do sales and and, yeah, they use the right the pricing. They use the pricing module

Speaker 2  51:23
that makes sense? Yep, yeah, absolutely, 100%

Speaker 1  51:28
if they can't do if they can't do sales and they can't do design, which Rick doesn't want to do any sales, and he sure doesn't want to do design. And Tina's not doing sales, and she's not good at design. So what do I do? I just need to somehow. What's that? Are

Matthias Miller  51:46
you going to find that in the same hat, somebody who's good at sales, somebody who's good at pricing and costing, and somebody who's good at design, like doesn't design requires some knowledge from production, doesn't, pricing, needs some financial knowledge. Doesn't sales require some of its own, its own stuff.

Speaker 1  52:15
I mean, I guess maybe I'm just, I'm thinking of the workload that's here, like one person in a week's time should be able to do all three that's the way I'm thinking, right, right?

Speaker 1  52:36
But you do? You feel like that's too big of an ask.

Matthias Miller  52:42
I'm not saying it's too big of an ask from a workload perspective. I'm saying those are three different skill sets that require three different bodies of knowledge.

Unknown Speaker  52:52
Do you do you?

Speaker 1  52:54
Doesn't sales do any design, though, because remy's guy, or he does all three maybe,

Matthias Miller  53:05
maybe you might be right.

Speaker 1  53:07
I think in the inner in our industry, that's, it's kind of, that is

Matthias Miller  53:11
how it works. That's kind of what

Speaker 1  53:13
I mean, it's kind of what we need here. I mean, yeah, palettes like, not that big of a deal. I know. I don't know who crates. He might not do any crazy. I'm not sure

Matthias Miller  53:21
sure, right? That's her,

Unknown Speaker  53:30
but I don't know.

Speaker 1  53:36
I mean, yeah, that's what I was excited about. Like, yep, maybe I don't know.

Matthias Miller  53:48
I mean, it makes sense. I get it all right. Well, do you want to?

Speaker 1  53:59
Well, you asked, What do we need? I mean, we are. You can't. You were saying about 99% accuracy,

Unknown Speaker  54:08
well on,

Matthias Miller  54:11
well, on a select few. But I'm not, I'm I'm not convinced on that at all. There's too many variables in the things that we're putting together, and I don't know what the variables are, I think, I don't think we've identified all the variables for sure. I mean random as an example. Does it have random? Doesn't that Well, I guess some of that's accounted for with the with the number of fasteners, or should theoretically be, does finished dimensions have any impact? Does there's one other one that I thought of. What was it?

Unknown Speaker  54:45
Finished dimensions in what way

Matthias Miller  54:50
I mean, the final size crates versus palettes, probably the biggest thing, like as it just straight up over. That's also a kind of one board feet, what were some of the other things? Well? But it's also really hard to say, without cleaning up some of these, some of these assembly outliers.

Speaker 1  55:29
I mean, right? And that's that's really intimidating there, because when I start working at them, I'm like, I don't know.

Matthias Miller  55:44
It's, I don't know. Well, maybe we should take a look at, yeah, I don't know what's like. I think what a lot of companies do at some point is basically saying, Are we profitable overall, and just assume we're going to lose a bunch of money on some and make a bunch of money on others.

Speaker 1  56:17
Yeah. But you're, you're looking at these items for, basically, you ran your, what is this? What is that spreadsheet that you're sharing me, with me there, that's, that's expected,

Matthias Miller  56:35
yeah, like, like a time assembly, time estimation, yeah.

Speaker 1  56:41
So time estimation, but that's only a relatively small percentage of the overall price, right, right?

Matthias Miller  56:50
Like, if you're looking at labor, if you're looking at labor as 12% and you're even if we get it within 50% accuracy, it means we're within you know that accounts for six to 18% of the overall price.

Unknown Speaker  57:05
Good, yep. So,

Matthias Miller  57:10
so there is this question of, How good does it actually need to be, right? And also, there is some human element in it where it's like, we think it's going to based on everything you said, we think it's going to be be this does. Is that realistic?

Speaker 1  57:29
Well, I mean, if I don't know if you, if you have no I think Matt, if you have the board footage, and you have the fasteners, and you look at that from a historical How long does it take for each fastener? And then if you add the difficulty of the board footage, and then you adjust a little bit for volume, because that that that considers that gives a lot of credence to setup time. I mean, one versus one versus 20. I mean 20 spreads it out a lot. I mean you could, I mean, you could just simply start at one and just,

Matthias Miller  58:17
yeah, I don't know. Well, it's not just setup time. It's, it's getting in the flow, like, like we talked about, well, I know across everything, go ahead.

Speaker 1  58:25
Well, if you always divide it, if you develop, if you divide the setup time by the amount of by the batch size, wouldn't that? That catches it, right? Maybe just simply, okay, just simply, a lot, 30 minutes,

Matthias Miller  58:46
well, we're already excluding setup time from the assembly time,

Speaker 1  58:52
but, but that's the biggest part of it, is the setup, right?

Matthias Miller  58:57
So in the price calculation, we still need to account for that as overhead, which, which, unless you want to say, include the total time, ignore, for the sake of this time calculation, come up with a calculator that

Speaker 1  59:12
well, because isn't setup time included in the total time and work order entries, it is

Matthias Miller  59:18
included in The total time. Yeah. So what? Why would we just ignore setup time? What we put in is set up time completely and just look at total assembly time, and if we account for batch size, it takes care of itself, right?

Speaker 1  59:32
Say that again, if just take total assembly time and then what ignore and account for batch size,

Matthias Miller  59:41
yeah, just account for batch size, and then you don't have to worry about setup time. Like setup time becomes meaningless, because you'll account for it in batch size, right?

Speaker 1  59:54
I guess, yeah. I mean, yeah. But again, if you would include setup. I'm just saying my equation would be like, hey, 15 minutes on the machine, divided by however many items that. But do you think that'd be a little a lot different equation than just batch size?

Matthias Miller  1:00:17
Well, this, if you do batch size, you get a lot more accurate picture, because you can look at how long did it take to do one, how long did it take to do 1000 Yeah, and you can vary based off of that.

Speaker 1  1:00:37
But I'm just saying if you if some jobs you never do less than 100 other jobs you do one or five, a lot like, isn't that going to be a little different? That's fair.

Matthias Miller  1:00:50
And it doesn't account for, I mean, well, it doesn't account for machine. I'm not sure how accurate or machine data is anyway, but doesn't account for machine. You a machine data, which it probably should,

Unknown Speaker  1:01:08
yeah, all the difference between machine and hand,

Matthias Miller  1:01:11
well, or from, from machine to machine, or from or between machine in hand, either one,

Speaker 1  1:01:18
well, yeah, there's a big difference there. Like there's a big difference in value generated from machine to hand, value generated per

Matthias Miller  1:01:34
hour. So overall, overall

Speaker 1  1:01:36
which should be, which should be captured in the fastener. Time different,

Matthias Miller  1:01:47
yeah, well, except your efficiency, except, right, it is your setup time. If you're looking to integrate setup time, if you're not keeping out set of time, then you would anyway. Then it varies you need. You need to account for variations by machine. But that's okay. We're not doing that well.

Speaker 1  1:02:27
I don't know if this tells it with where you're at, but the machines at a cost as well, you know they right. So I don't know if that levels the playing field or not.

Matthias Miller  1:02:50
So overall, if you look at all 7000 work orders, okay, we're within seven, we're we're within seven and a half percent

Unknown Speaker  1:03:03
of what's of what? What do you mean

Matthias Miller  1:03:05
our estimation, if we go through and estimate everything, well, actually, that's not completely True. Let's exclude these guys here. I

Unknown Speaker  1:03:29
on time,

Matthias Miller  1:03:36
34567, seven, we're within less than a percent overall. Now, some items are very substantial, I'm not sure. Okay, if you go across all our work orders, yeah, and we say, Go, estimate what this is going to be. And here's the actual there's per product variations that can be pretty dramatic, but if you look overall, right, we're within 1%

Speaker 1  1:04:11
gotcha, of estimated price

Matthias Miller  1:04:15
versus you saying estimated assembly time, just the assembly time. So you would take the assembly so well that, I mean, that's because that's, that's all the assembly tracker gives us, right, right?

Speaker 1  1:04:33
So, so on the assembly, I mean, so you're pretty so, I mean, that seems good, right? That seems

Matthias Miller  1:04:37
solid. Yeah, it does mean, though, and I guess this is the question, does it matter on a per item basis? If like, it means, if you adjust pricing on some of these based on this model, I mean it should still all come out in the wash. I. Um, but like the wave Set Go ahead.

Speaker 1  1:05:03
Like, if you look at just overall, each item overall weighed against your formula, which ones are a way out, one way, which are way out the other way? Shouldn't we look at those and and maybe that will give us an indicator of what needs adjusted, yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:05:24
but not late on a Friday,

Unknown Speaker  1:05:25
right? Thank you.

Matthias Miller  1:05:28
Oh, it's late. It's late there. You gotta go see your family

Speaker 1  1:05:32
next week. Is what do you want to I mean, I feel like I need to do a bunch of cleanup. I'm going to take off Monday anyway, I take my boys to the mountains for two days. Um,

Speaker 1  1:05:51
yeah, I have some other questions and stuff I got for you. Um, it's too late now what I feel like I need to get in here and clean up a bunch of stuff that drives me nuts at stuff that's not right, but I don't know. I don't have anybody here that I trust to go in and clean up right, properly, of anybody. But if John, if George, takes over John's area, like I have a solution in mind for the entry stuff, but I still wish I could trust Tina or Amanda. But John and Tina are kind of working, working together. They're learning it. They, potentially, they're okay going forward. I just gotta see. But with

Matthias Miller  1:06:50
what's that, John, I can, I can kind of understand, I don't understand why you would have somebody in under, in the accounting department that you don't trust for accuracy. I

Unknown Speaker  1:07:04
You mean Rick Tina,

Unknown Speaker  1:07:10
oh, accounting, as in, you mean, like

Matthias Miller  1:07:13
pricing, she's under Rick pricing. I don't know any anything in the finance I mean, if she's in under Rick, doesn't that put her into the financial side? Yeah,

Speaker 1  1:07:31
yeah. I mean, she's on a Rick so I don't you know. I mean, does he cover up for her? Does he hide her mistakes and that? I mean, probably,

Matthias Miller  1:07:44
I have worked with one bookkeeper who who did was not accurate, third party. It was the worst night nightmare in the world. It was just terrible. And then even after we literally wrapped up the engagement, because for all the reasons, like, a year later, we got a bill from them for something that they missed, invoicing us for just complete insanity, like you just don't want that. Can we so anyway?

Unknown Speaker  1:08:19
How important is accurate data like, well,

Matthias Miller  1:08:22
the financials, if you're playing paying tax, I mean in the financial department,

Unknown Speaker  1:08:31
well, I mean when you're invoicing customers,

Unknown Speaker  1:08:35
how might what mistakes are acceptable?

Unknown Speaker  1:08:39
It depends where you aware?

Unknown Speaker  1:08:48
Yeah,

Speaker 1  1:08:56
so these evaluations are really important. I like to do that, but I kind of, I feel a little proud. I'm feeling pressure to right size, this other stuff, but I should breathe. I mean, we caught a pretty bad one here. We'll, we'll correct on our side, because we're adjusting. It doesn't make it perfect. It just makes it better, yep. Which helps the overall, overall we're doing. Okay, yep, I'm going to keep walking through this stuff with these people and try to make sure we have the right people in the right seats, which could get a little hairy. If I hold the line, it's going to get a little fun. It's going to get a little hairy.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:42
Yep, so let's,

Speaker 1  1:09:46
I will, do you have a block of time where we can, I mean, I got this, I got this, um, what port, um here, not now, but I'll show you it. Mean, this is what it is anyway, right?

Matthias Miller  1:10:02
Yeah, absolutely. I can get with Amanda on Monday and get that set up. If you

Speaker 1  1:10:07
want that's perfect. I'll be off. That sounds great. And then is your

Matthias Miller  1:10:11
laptop going to be around? I can leave it here. Are you fine? I'll tell a man, I

Speaker 1  1:10:17
usually leave it on my desk. I'll tell her she's allowed to. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:10:26
I mean, if you're not fine with that, we can, I can get everything plugged in, and we can you and I can test it sometime. I It's whatever you're comfortable with, no pressure.

Speaker 1  1:10:35
We'll just Tuesday. And, I mean, Amanda can be here. Well, no, when? When do you have a block of time to

Matthias Miller  1:10:41
so Tuesday, I'll be free, except from like Well, anytime before 10 Eastern, anytime after about 1230 Eastern on Tuesday.

Speaker 1  1:10:52
Yeah, perfect. 1230 Eastern until cows come home. All right. Is that good? Yep, sounds good. Matt, that's awesome. It don't, don't, I don't know. Don't agonize. Her on your side about the pricing stuff too much. But I think we're, I mean, you're, we're on the right track.

Speaker 2  1:11:16
We're making progress. If, Hey, Don

Speaker 1  1:11:19
it could be nice if we could, it'd be nice to clean up the some of those discrepancies. But, I mean, you already, we already have a tool, a couple tools. I mean, that spreadsheet right there, that 100, there's ones that are 100% off. I mean, that's gotta be,

Matthias Miller  1:11:40
what's it's so we're not looking for perfection. We're looking for we're looking for accurate enough. That's what we're looking for, 80% even 80% accurate gets us way down the road.

Speaker 1  1:11:55
So Matt, if I get in there and look at that the discrepancies, can you add another weight for volume on top of that discrepancy? So then that will be a true. Makes sense? Yeah, that will clean up the most impactful, yep.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:21
How good we can don Thank you. Bud. Makes sense. Matt, yep, okay, awesome.

Speaker 1  1:12:31
Awesome in here too, but there's some remaining needed minus. What is that? What are the minus?

Matthias Miller  1:12:39
Stock items, some of them other ones, they just assembled too much. For some reason, we assembled more than than we have sales orders for. How did we so it's possible that you could have a sales order for anything about this. Well, I mean, are, are any of these, like AHF two? Does that get sold as anything else? No. So it's either bad data, we put it in under the wrong item, we're missing sales. Is

Speaker 1  1:13:07
this taking information from sales orders or from actual invoices? This sorry

Matthias Miller  1:13:12
invoice, invoices? I'm sorry. Well,

Speaker 1  1:13:15
how did how do we So are there still canceled invoices?

Matthias Miller  1:13:19
Hang on. Hang on, it is coming off. I don't know if this makes a difference. See, we have the manual adjustment on sales orders. Let's

Matthias Miller  1:13:40
if they invoiced it without a sales order, that wouldn't be showing up,

Speaker 1  1:13:52
that quantity assembled needs to be actual invoice amount. Um, and I guess I'm a little concerned if that still, like, there's Marietta ones that are still in there, because Armstrong is in here, and it is way off. Where's that at? I saw it earlier.

Speaker 1  1:14:27
I guess that has to do with the cancel load situation. But isn't that possible with a bunch of these other ones too? I'm sure I'm not seeing it right now.

Matthias Miller  1:14:45
Okay, so this is the invoice now,

Speaker 1  1:14:50
00, yeah, oh, that's nine. No, it's not way off. It's 9% off.

Matthias Miller  1:14:56
Armstrong. Okay, so there is. Um, difference between

Speaker 1  1:15:07
the or, sorry, the total needed. The total needed has to be, wait a minute, quantity invoiced and total needed. Wait a minute, are you getting a percentage from the needed or the invoice total from the needed? Shouldn't that be from the invoiced?

Matthias Miller  1:15:39
Why? Because they overwrote, if they overwrote it, they're saying the sales order was wrong.

Speaker 1  1:15:48
Wait, what you mean that manual adjustment? I'm looking at AR, 0001, we take a look quantity, invoice, 364,008 952, five, okay, manual adjustment, 27,000, 374, well,

Matthias Miller  1:16:09
they overwrote a bunch of sales order quantities.

Speaker 1  1:16:19
So that's is that what changed the invoice number?

Matthias Miller  1:16:24
That's, that's what changed the total needed.

Speaker 1  1:16:32
But shouldn't that doesn't change what we actually invoice, right? What we actually invoice was 364,

Matthias Miller  1:16:39
those, those, sorry, those are the orders that were invoiced. If we looked into the actual invoices, which includes some without sales orders, there's actually 371, which isn't any better. Wait a minute,

Speaker 1  1:16:52
you're saying, If you Sorry, you lost me. You were sorry. I didn't keep up with you. Matt, what was it?

Matthias Miller  1:17:04
The actual invoice amount? We actually invoiced 371 or almost three, 370 2000

Speaker 1  1:17:10
Well, that's the number that we need, though, right? Don't you?

Matthias Miller  1:17:14
It is, yeah, and then the but we still need the manual, the quantity, the manual adjustment,

Speaker 1  1:17:21
which? But that's a different but what it what is the manual adjustment?

Matthias Miller  1:17:27
Or wait when people go in and override the quantity? Why is

Unknown Speaker  1:17:31
the invoice amount different than 372,

Matthias Miller  1:17:35
because I'm pulling it off of sales orders instead of invoices. That's why. Oh, and we have invoices that didn't have a sales order.

Speaker 1  1:17:45
Well, that's okay, right, isn't it? I mean, I still

Matthias Miller  1:17:55
Invoicing is still a better number, right?

Speaker 1  1:18:02
So, 364, is a sales order number,

Matthias Miller  1:18:06
essentially, yeah, well, it invoiced sales order,

Speaker 1  1:18:13
but I'd rather do invoice total, because secret, she'll cancel a sales order, but she'll create another invoice, right? Yeah, that needs to be the invoice amount, and then that okay, if that's the invoice amount three, do we agree on that?

Matthias Miller  1:18:40
I mean, we agree that that's what it needs to be.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:42
Yeah. Okay, so that's 372 now.

Matthias Miller  1:18:52
So if we change that, AR, 001, we have 372 we still, they still adjusted the totals for 27,000 more than what the sales orders said, because the currently, the override lives on the sales order.

Speaker 1  1:19:06
So John adjusted all those totals. Somebody did, and that's in what ended up. Well, let me get this here. Oh yeah, it would have been.

Matthias Miller  1:19:21
It would be sales orders by for AR, 001001, the over, if you sort Hang on, that is not,

Speaker 1  1:19:31
no, I don't, he didn't stuff,

Unknown Speaker  1:19:35
total needed.

Unknown Speaker  1:19:37
He didn't override anything invoiced.

Unknown Speaker  1:19:48
He did not override any arms. No, you're right.

Matthias Miller  1:19:58
Well, he ever wrote one? But does the override? Do we even care about the override? In this case, we don't. Do we?

Unknown Speaker  1:20:10
You mean that manual adjustment? Yeah, we

Matthias Miller  1:20:13
just straight up look at the total invoice.

Speaker 1  1:20:15
You put that in there to see what adjustments he made. But why is it showing 27,000

Matthias Miller  1:20:25
the numbers wrong. That's the short answer.

Speaker 1  1:20:28
Okay, well, I mean, it's nice to see if it's there, though I like to see it be there,

Matthias Miller  1:20:37
but we want the

Speaker 1  1:20:39
but I just think it's there. It's just there as another indicator of whatever.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:46
Just Right, right? It's just

Unknown Speaker  1:20:50
a warning light or whatever.

Matthias Miller  1:21:01
So, yeah, but we need a different way to show that. Like, what do you I mean? Could we show number of

Unknown Speaker  1:21:16
why a different way?

Matthias Miller  1:21:21
Because it's not meaningful as it

Unknown Speaker  1:21:28
is. What if we just change it? Sorry.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:31
I mean just but the

Matthias Miller  1:21:33
27,000 isn't. But if we change it to a yes or no, whether it includes manual adjustment, oh,

Speaker 1  1:21:42
well, I'd rather just be blank and show a number if it's been adjusted, then read a yes or no. You don't mean more, more

Matthias Miller  1:21:51
text what? Okay, let's, but, if we, but it would make more sense to do it off of the sales order quantity. That's where part of the weird

Matthias Miller  1:22:11
we're looking at.

Speaker 1  1:22:19
But we don't really care about sales orders? Do we? I guess we do, but aren't we only taking invoices? Is that what you said earlier, invoices that were attached to sales orders was the 364,

Matthias Miller  1:22:44
here, hang on, I think I have it.

Matthias Miller  1:22:54
Minus eight. That's not right either.

Matthias Miller  1:23:26
Know that's actually what it should be. I

Matthias Miller  1:23:45
AR, 0001, I

Matthias Miller  1:24:00
I don't know, we don't have to take time now, but that should,

Matthias Miller  1:24:16
ultimately you have the quantity assembled so that one ultimately looks like it's remaining needed is should be invoiced minus

Unknown Speaker  1:24:31
assembled, yes,

Matthias Miller  1:24:37
And then the discrepancy should run off of that

Unknown Speaker  1:24:47
total needed I mean, I don't know if we need the total needed column. Do we?

Matthias Miller  1:24:55
No, not necessarily.

Speaker 1  1:25:04
Quantity invoice be right beside quantity assembled. If we're still letting John do an override, I don't we're gonna. Are we talking about making that go away? Well, it's

Matthias Miller  1:25:19
not completely clear if we can or not, but potentially,

Speaker 1  1:25:24
I think, I think we're going to be able to make that go away. I'm not suggesting we do it now, but, but that can sit there for now as an indicator of any that he has overrode. Sure if that'd be the first column the invoice would be the second assembled would be the third.

Speaker 2  1:25:51
That would be. Or do you have other thoughts? Or do you have other Yeah, that's I um,

Matthias Miller  1:26:08
if we just make that adjustment, be okay, so we

Matthias Miller  1:26:22
go back to back to the AR 001, okay, so that takes us down to a 4% discrepancy on the ar, ar one,

Unknown Speaker  1:26:33
yeah, that's good.

Unknown Speaker  1:26:43
And that's gonna affect some of these other ones, isn't it?

Unknown Speaker  1:26:46
Yeah, it will. Okay, awesome.

Speaker 1  1:26:50
Well, I'm seeing some easy fixes here. I mean, there are. I just need to spend. I need to cram this thing. Do I cram this first or do I, um, okay, not to get too wordy here, I alluded to pricing thing being very important. I believe it is. But like I said, we're we're better now than we were four days ago, three days ago, we're correcting some you know, we're at least on the track again. I feel like at least get ready, get out. We're still in the pits. Never mind never I'm getting worried. Sorry. It's all going it. Um, do I focus my attention on this, clean up this stuff and keep honing in these things on my side? Because I can do it, I can. Or do I focus on these evaluations and people being in the right place? Or do I like take a breath and do the next thing that best I can like I have been doing, feel like I have been doing for three and a half years, but it's not enough. Often feels like it's not enough.

Matthias Miller  1:28:12
I don't know what's the one thing that if you would do would make everything else easier,

Speaker 1  1:28:20
delegate. Have the people taking care of stuff, not, not so many things on my responsibilities.

Matthias Miller  1:28:32
So you said that, your wife says that. So, I mean, if I had to say that the biggest well that that her biggest issue at this point is a people issue as well. Is that fair? Did I read your text, right? Yeah.
