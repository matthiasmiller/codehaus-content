Matthias Miller  00:18
Hello, hello. This is, this is Matt. We were texting a little bit earlier. Yeah, yeah. I just wanted to, yeah, just, I guess checking in you mentioned maybe swinging by, and it's a little bit of a long drive for me, but I thought I just give you a call. Oh, okay. And so, yeah, we're just wondering, are you a you're one of the dealers for Timberline. Is that right?

Unknown Speaker  00:58
We are all

Matthias Miller  00:59
right. And I mean, do you guys, I guess, just for little context and figure out if this even makes sense, we're looking for, for dealers to partner with to sell more sheds, you know, coming here in February, and didn't really know, didn't really know where you guys were at with that, how things have been going for you guys.

Speaker 1  01:26
Okay, you manufacture sheds. Now,

Matthias Miller  01:29
what we do is we work with shed companies, and have been working in the shed industry since about 2016 and help help them. Two things, number one, get more leads. Number two, sell more sheds to the leads that they that they got. And there's different ways we help them do that, but that's, that's what we're

Speaker 1  01:53
doing. Okay? Well, I'd be if you can email me some literature or something on what you do. And maybe we can, if you get get in this area, we can sit down and talk about it.

Matthias Miller  02:09
Okay, would you is there, is there a specific part of that that's more important for you than than another?

Speaker 1  02:19
Well, I mean, sales is always more important than anything. Yeah, if I don't sell, I don't make money. Yeah?

Matthias Miller  02:29
Does? Does?

Speaker 1  02:31
Yeah, I need, I need to make money. So, yeah,

Matthias Miller  02:35
for real, does Timberline give you? Do they do any advertising for you? Do they send you any leads at all? They

Speaker 1  02:41
do. They have a they don't sell to the public out of their main office or nothing. They don't sell anything to the public. If they get a call about a building, what they do is they put it in the system and they send it to the nearest dealer that's near that person. Okay,

Matthias Miller  03:08
all right. And then about how many of those folks do you guys get? Do you get a month? I know it varies, obviously, for by kind of year.

Speaker 1  03:16
Oh, by get them. If I get them to come to my lot, I can sell them the building, sure, and the main thing is getting them to come to the lot, right?

Matthias Miller  03:28
All right. And do you have any any area restrictions?

Speaker 1  03:35
Well, within 50 miles from my area all the way around me. Sure I can go as far as I can go, all the way to Bristol,

Unknown Speaker  03:48
up past Greenville, over into Irwin, and up that way, there's a light go within 50 miles of anywhere around me. All right,

Matthias Miller  04:03
yeah, and then, do you have any I guess, what's your budget like for for advertising? Do you have a budget? Doesn't have to be, I guess, straight up the bottom we

Speaker 1  04:21
can do old school. I do everything, like Facebook and stuff like that.

Matthias Miller  04:27
All right, so if, if we had a way to, I mean, we get a free resource, we hand out, we do this just we do this just because we can. There's a guy who has a system for Facebook marketplace. He sold 1.6 million last year, 62% of it came from free leads on Facebook. And I'm happy to send that over to you as a free a free guide for you if, if you're interested.

Speaker 1  04:55
Well, I mean, I'm always interested in anything that will help me make money. You. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  05:00
totally, what's, what's the best email for you?

Speaker 1  05:05
Griffith Irwin, nine, seven at Gmail.

Matthias Miller  05:11
Okay, all right. And then Irwin with it with an iron, e,

Speaker 1  05:19
e, okay, R, W, I, N,

Matthias Miller  05:24
all right, Griffith, all right, at Gmail,

Unknown Speaker  05:30
and Griffith is the same as Andy.

Matthias Miller  05:33
All right, sounds good. That's easy. That's easy. Well,

Speaker 1  05:37
name that for two famous things, the hanging elephant. And Andy Gerson, fair enough. Yeah, figure that one out. My mother only good. That's awesome. You sound like you got got yourself a little bit of a cold? Yeah?

Matthias Miller  05:58
I do. I need a i We had it. We had a bunch of cold weather where we came from. We're right in our area, and I gotta, you gotta check water here, where I'm at all the time. Anyway, I just, I haven't been keeping it up. So, yeah, yeah. Alright. So then if we, if we get several Facebook marketplace, is something like a $1,500 month. If we know that, we can turn those into sales for you. And I guess if you're old school, quite honestly, there's a lot of folks who just want to buy over the phone. It sounds to me like you're not really that interested in doing that. You'd rather have them show up on the

Speaker 1  06:36
lot do a transaction over the phone, but I'd rather meet my customers. You know, right? Because I've got a, I've got a weird, weird sell ability about me. I can, I can talk to any kind of person, rich, poor, whatever. And nine times out of 10 I'll sell them something if they if they're seriously looking Yep, because I'm gonna tell you, there's only one other building company that I know of that sells a comparable building to Timberline. And that's Cherokee structures as down in Chucky Tennessee. And they do, I don't know what kind of advertising they do. They're Mennonite. Family owned.

Matthias Miller  07:47
I actually talked to one of their dealers last week, Richie with best sheds.

Speaker 1  07:56
Okay, well, I don't know who best sheds are. Where are they located?

Matthias Miller  08:02
I have to pull that up. I can't remember that off the top of my head.

Matthias Miller  08:14
Oh, sorry, I came from in front of the top of my head. Sorry, no,

Speaker 1  08:18
we've got, we've got a buzz and beyond, we've got old hickory around here. There's probably eight or 10 different companies. Cherokee has one of the best buildings in the market. I was a dealer for Cherokee for three and a half years.

Matthias Miller  08:45
So why'd you switch me and me?

Speaker 1  08:46
Me and her new lock manager had a had a disagreement, and he talked the owner into not letting me sell no more.

Matthias Miller  09:03
That sounds like a story.

Speaker 1  09:06
Yeah, well, he started talking all kinds of Bs, and I told him, if he comes on my lot, I'd break his face.

Matthias Miller  09:17
He didn't. He didn't appreciate that very much.

Speaker 1  09:19
I don't think you did. And he closed down two lots because of that with Cherokee. Wow, there was three lots that I'm friends with, the owners of both of them, other than me. Well, when they done that to me, they said, well, they'll most likely do it to me too. So they all changed over, wow, yeah. So they lost three lots in the area. That's

Matthias Miller  09:54
wild, that's wild.

Speaker 1  09:58
So you know, if you. Though, if you've looked around the area, Jersey, I've got an old hickory lot about eight miles from where I'm at. And if you go to Elizabeth and they're all over the town, above and beyond old hickories down there, there's a couple others. They try and saturate an area with dealers, and people don't know where to go. Yeah, and Old Hickory has a real bad reputation. They're they're man. Manufacturing Plant recently been flooded in that Helene, and there was probably 250 buildings out behind their their plant. And I would seriously doubt with and and I don't know they did or not, but they'd had to replace every bit of wood that's on that building, just about Wow. So you're going to tell me they cheated all that financially? I don't think so,

Matthias Miller  11:25
right?

Speaker 1  11:29
They put, they put a little lipstick on them and left them alone. Yeah, I wouldn't buy old hickory building if they give it to me.

Matthias Miller  11:41
Interesting. The old hickories. I mean, I mean they're, they're kind of a, are they a mini, tough shed equivalent, or, or, how do you

Speaker 1  11:53
I think of them as a bunch of hats. Got it before I got into this business, me and a friend of mine, he's a real estate broker, we thought about ways to make money, so we figured we'd go visit some of the lot. You know, the manufacturers in the area, Old Hickory was one of them. We went and looked at they might have six people in the warehouse building, buildings, uh, Cherokee. They've got maybe 12 or 13. They've got about, I think that. I think they've got now I'm thinking, or they've got about 1010, dealers they had, may have more. Now, I don't know, timber lines got 50 some odd dealers got it, and they just opened up another, another builder's place on the other end of the state. So delivery wasn't so much hard on them. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  13:22
So that's, you know, it makes it easier for getting stopped to people and everything. And I get, I can call them on a Monday, and probably within a week, I can have a custom order built. They do special they do special orders. They constantly do some kind of discount.

Speaker 1  14:00
They right now they're doing that 10% on new and new buildings and 20% on repo buildings. If you do a special order or a custom build, I can do 5% see so they try to make it where the customers can get a deal, and I can always take money out of my commission if it's a big enough, if it's a big Enough, building a cell for me, I'll take two 3% off of mine. I don't care. I'm not greedy. Yep,

Matthias Miller  14:48
and, and do they have you on a 10% or how does that work?

Unknown Speaker  14:51
I'm on a 10% Yeah, yep, and knock on woods. You. This is my I'm celebrating my first year with Timberline,

Speaker 1  15:10
even in the bag crunch of things where the weather has been bad. That thing is 10 months. Now, in 10 months, I've sold almost $200,000 worth of buildings.

Matthias Miller  15:25
Nice, nice.

Speaker 1  15:29
I mean, I've done well. I mean, I've never missed the rent payment, never. My friend owns the building, so if I missed it, he wouldn't care. But,

Matthias Miller  15:40
yeah, it's still good. Yeah, there's, there's a saying by a wise guy who said it's good to make friends with money. Keep friends with money too, probably.

Speaker 1  15:54
And that's, let's see. I got my my 1099, the other day from Timberline,

Unknown Speaker  16:04
I made 16,000 something. Then I've got Eagle Clark porch and garages. I've sold a few of them. I've got North Carolina steel buildings and American Builder System builders network.

Speaker 1  16:26
And I've sold probably anywhere between 60 and 80,000 for either one of them, nice. I mean, I made some money this year. Yeah. Well,

Matthias Miller  16:38
it's and those steel buildings are. We've had quite a few different dealers, especially, I mean, it's been interesting to talk with folks even a little bit east of you. They said the barns were down, sheds were down, but steel buildings were up, and that's what carried him through,

Unknown Speaker  16:59
exactly. And

Matthias Miller  17:01
and even folks who me and they're, we got this one gal and we, we did pretty much. Did everything. We're doing everything we can on pricing and and we're saying, Look, we want you to be able to scale with us, but this is about as far as we can go. But she said, yeah, she wants to put that many metal that money towards metal structures instead of towards sheds, just because, man, if you got somebody, I mean, if you get 10 people calling in for metal structure, and if you can only close one of them that that can get you to break even, and then everything on top of that is just and depending on the building right

Speaker 1  17:42
now he's getting a shed, a metal cover, a motor home car port. My take on that is $460 okay, that's with Eagle. If I go another company I got, I would make a little bit more,

Matthias Miller  18:08
right? And what this lady's after is, I mean, I know there's not a lot of money in carports, but if you can get, you know, RV storage or or other things that like, like that, like an enclosed metal building.

Speaker 1  18:25
Yeah, I've got closed garages. I can put three doors, four doors. I can make them as big as you want them. My son works for hackneyed the big supplier of all these little convenience stores. Yeah. HT hack me, and I'm working on a quote for them right now. It's a 40 by 80 building. We're looking at, probably about $120,000 building. Wow, 90 figure, 12% of that, yeah, that big mine, yep, well, I actually want that that big. I can go to 15% that amount of money. I go up to 15%

Matthias Miller  19:22
Wow, that would make a difference. Oh,

Unknown Speaker  19:27
yeah. I mean, you know now. And also, a couple of my companies give really great discounts. Anything over 5000 they give 15% anything over 10,000 or more, automatic, 2025, yeah.

Speaker 1  19:54
I mean, you figure that, I mean, and I've got to, I'm on Facebook. You? Betty's yard barns, yep, that ads not really been pulling a whole lot to me. It lets people know where I'm at, though, sure, and fortunately, it don't cost me nothing.

Matthias Miller  20:17
Yeah, right,

Speaker 1  20:21
right. So, if you'd like to get Are you gonna be in this in East Tennessee anytime soon? Are

Matthias Miller  20:32
