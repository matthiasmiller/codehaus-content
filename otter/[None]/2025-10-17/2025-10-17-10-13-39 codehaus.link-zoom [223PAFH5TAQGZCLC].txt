Unknown Speaker  02:38
Me, please.

Unknown Speaker  02:44
I ready to write the world's problems?

Matthias Miller  02:46
Yes, I am. Let's do it.

Speaker 1  02:52
Oh, Sean got the, I think it's updated. The accounting company stuff set up for you. We can go in and fill that out. All right. He got that done before he left last night, and he is now going to Dallas, I think, to watch an f1 race Austin.

Unknown Speaker  03:13
So he's

Unknown Speaker  03:15
going to be doing more exciting things than we are.

Matthias Miller  03:19
Yes, that is, that is true. Well, here's what I suggest. You want to share your split the proposal, share your screen. Let's start with getting the right things in the right sections, yep. And then once we've got that, we can start announcing the statue, sex, the sections, whatever those things are called,

Unknown Speaker  03:50
exactly, okay.

Speaker 1  03:57
That was a CRM I'd be complaining about all the white space on the screen.

Matthias Miller  04:05
That's funny. Such a waste. Such a waste.

Speaker 1  04:13
Okay, so we start you thinking starting their project management plan section and move stuff?

Matthias Miller  04:21
Yeah, I think so.

Unknown Speaker  04:24
So,

Matthias Miller  04:29
I think the biggest thing I don't want to lose in the project management plan, I don't know how to how do we want to model this? The things that are needed for go live, right? We kind of

Unknown Speaker  04:44
have, I'm not

Unknown Speaker  04:46
I how do we model this?

Matthias Miller  04:52
What we've done in the past, I think sometimes we've taken entire sections of the proposal. And had, like a phase one, we could do this. What if we put in, take everything that's currently,

Unknown Speaker  05:17
think I'm gonna want the jobs over here.

Matthias Miller  05:21
Yeah, let's take everything that's like starting with menu, like insert a line above it and put it in phase one, a which is, which is demo.

Speaker 1  05:37
I struggle to use the buttons correctly. I don't yet know where they insert. Okay, phase one a

Matthias Miller  05:47
Yep, and this is the expo demo or something like that, yep. And then everything inside of here can be indented, pretty much.

Speaker 1  06:00
But then what do we So, what do we use as the source of truth for the system long term?

Matthias Miller  06:12
Then, as we build it, we'll consolidate, as we complete phases, we merge them into, or maybe this should be, maybe it shouldn't be phase one A, maybe this should just be maybe Phase One A should be more like

Matthias Miller  06:33
complete.

Speaker 1  06:38
Thing is, these aren't necessarily all complete, but I guess we can. We can rearrange.

Matthias Miller  06:45
Okay, let's do this actually. This would be more useful. Let's Yeah, no, this section can be complete, the complete section, or something like, Oh no, yep. And then let's put the next phases above this so it's closer to the top. So then we need a phase 1b which is, or we could have timelines, December 2025,

Unknown Speaker  07:17
which is

Matthias Miller  07:20
Berman plus early client plus early, early client or something, yeah. And then we'll have another one underneath that, which is spring 2025 or 2026 that's true. It will be 2026 it will be 2026 which is public go to market, and then, just exactly, and then the next one after that is unscheduled future enhancements or something like that.

Speaker 1  08:21
And then some of these things are really not complete. We still have in here.

Matthias Miller  08:27
Let's pull out.

Speaker 1  08:29
Okay, let's like, I mean, emissions are very definitely not

Matthias Miller  08:34
well, then do we need that for?

Speaker 1  08:38
We need that for, surely we don't

Matthias Miller  08:41
probably throw it up there.

Unknown Speaker  08:50
User Groups are also not. We didn't, haven't done anything with silver limb settings. This is out of date.

Matthias Miller  09:02
Well, if it's just out of date, then to do Shawn to update what's happening in the live system,

Speaker 1  09:17
I'll just think I'm right that it's out of date.

Unknown Speaker  09:30
So then,

Matthias Miller  09:36
are there other things there that you're Oh, we'll get. We'll work down through our list too, yeah, oh, you're doing that. Okay, nice. This for formatting.

Speaker 2  09:48
Maybe that's too much duplication, I don't know, but records, gracious, we've got. I.

Speaker 1  10:00
So I have two days in here for Sean contract definition is, definitely needs a lot of cleanup. Should I pop this up?

Matthias Miller  10:10
Yeah, that should I mean, maybe we want to, yeah, that's true.

Speaker 1  10:17
Then, yes, I guess we just understand there's some blur back and forth between

Matthias Miller  10:24
Absolutely, but, but the dividing line is, is it done? And if the answer is no, I mean, we could conceivably split this. If there's distinct pieces, it can be split out, but it's not, we're not there, sure,

Speaker 1  10:37
definitely not with contract death. No, that type is simple enough accounting company is pretty much done this, we're assuming is a list of revenue accounts.

Unknown Speaker  10:49
Yes, hang

Matthias Miller  11:01
on, handle different methods of accounting for payouts. Oh, that's right. I can't, I can't answer that. I think that's a I don't know where this falls. This is, this is this is going to be clarified based on the this is where the closing loops gets you into trouble. But I it. Some of this stuff is easier to address in sales conversations when we actually

Speaker 1  11:27
get to Gotcha. Brass, so is there, is there a place where we can just leave a few to do's in the quote, unquote complete section that we know we're needing to come back to later, or is that not a good idea?

Matthias Miller  11:39
Yeah, is there something besides to do? IDD like, is there a to do that? We should say, like, I don't know. I mean, it's to do backlog. Let's do that. I like that, and you just put it in the design spec. What about this? What do we want to do if there's a revenue account not listed for a fee? Type? We want to a way to define and ask my accountant field, but presumably fail, which needs to be implemented, but it's not okay.

Unknown Speaker  12:19
So does this a

Unknown Speaker  12:24
we need to

Speaker 1  12:26
well, although, okay, how do we design this now? Or just keep going, leave it at. It to do IDD. It needs to fail.

Matthias Miller  12:41
Yeah, I mean, we need to finish implementation of accounting impact, but it really has nothing to do with the accounting company

Unknown Speaker  12:47
record, right? Well, then,

Matthias Miller  12:50
then let's but so then what we need is up there in import. We need an import section up there for accounting impact or or schedule tasks or something

Unknown Speaker  13:05
I'll do schedule tasks for now.

Unknown Speaker  13:09
I like it. We can always update these as we go.

Unknown Speaker  13:23
And we can add more, but that's there for now.

Unknown Speaker  13:32
This is,

Speaker 1  13:34
oh, I'm not convinced these are exactly the note types we want, but maybe they are I just felt like there was Dwayne was a little confused when he was giving this list to us.

Unknown Speaker  13:51
So are these shipped right now?

Matthias Miller  14:00
I mean, I would say to do backlog, like, is this a good thing to note? Yes, does this really matter right now? No, we even released in the spring without it. Yeah, maybe yes, we can. I mean, the kind of thing I'd love to have done, but I don't, yeah, you're right. I agree. It's, it's like, but again, we're the last five to 10% of perfection can be the most expensive.

Unknown Speaker  14:28
There's another perfection. Yep. This is also perfection. I

Speaker 1  14:43
um, this is something that will be coded yet sweet. So is it fine to just leave those in the complete section when I know there's little things,

Matthias Miller  14:52
yeah, yeah, I don't hear especially it's all the more. So when there's a product you. Written up,

Speaker 1  15:00
like, exactly, there's, yeah, there's literally a product change for it.

Unknown Speaker  15:04
So what do

Unknown Speaker  15:08
we do with this? This is the

Matthias Miller  15:16
implemented. Shouldn't

Unknown Speaker  15:19
this be in the customer section

Matthias Miller  15:24
driver's license. Yeah, it would be the customer.

Unknown Speaker  15:42
We haven't, but it looks like it's just a single field. We don't have confidentiality on it.

Matthias Miller  15:54
Let's I think what I would rather do. I don't know how this should go, but this is really around. In my mind, there should be something with s3 setup, or, I don't

Unknown Speaker  16:11
know s1 is this, is this December?

Matthias Miller  16:13
I think we need it for December. Yeah, I

Unknown Speaker  16:28
I love how it randomly doesn't update my notes.

Unknown Speaker  16:47
Have the space to be clean.

Unknown Speaker  17:15
So,

Unknown Speaker  17:21
so what's left to do here?

Matthias Miller  17:26
So we need to set up the history account license.

Matthias Miller  17:42
We also need there is, well, I guess we'll get to there.

Matthias Miller  17:52
We need a, I would make this a permissions drop list for visibility, which would be custom customer.

Matthias Miller  18:11
It'd be, it'd be customer, it would be standard status. I don't standard staff. That's weird. And then like enough for now, executives, I mean, like Super Admin. I don't

Speaker 1  18:33
know what you call it, Moses's or Aaron's. That wasn't a standard staff. I

Matthias Miller  18:43
Yeah, you're welcome. Then,

Speaker 1  18:48
do we need to make a list of s3 like what we're storing on s3

Matthias Miller  18:54
I mean, I think it's, I don't think, I mean, it's just search for the the Invisibility is, well, where is, I would do a, I mean, this is, this is a do it to do IDD, or, yeah, to do IDD on, finalize The permissions list and make sure this makes sense for all the places we have attachments. I

Unknown Speaker  19:46
This guy.

Unknown Speaker  19:48
It's basically,

Matthias Miller  19:58
which this. That's handled above.

Unknown Speaker  20:07
This guy can just go, because we were talking about

Unknown Speaker  20:09
it already, right? Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  20:17
What about SMS, opt in, stuff?

Matthias Miller  20:22
So flush out with Matthias. It's visible only from not editable in detail, screen synced with Twilio. Oh,

Unknown Speaker  20:36
goodness.

Matthias Miller  20:42
Let's move this out. Nice permission. Move this out into a move it into a December item, and then Dwayne and I will need it would be know, SMS and email opt outs,

Matthias Miller  21:10
yeah, and then this is a To Do. IDD. I think Dwayne basically said, I don't want to think about it

Speaker 1  21:19
anyway. That makes sense.

Matthias Miller  21:22
I don't blame him. I don't want to think about it either.

Speaker 1  21:28
While he making to do ID these red it's just a lot easier to find. Like, I almost skipped over that one there because it wasn't, because it wasn't, it was blue, and some of that doesn't, it doesn't catch my eye. Yep, I guess I should also

Unknown Speaker  21:43
just do that.

Speaker 1  21:50
I should add a note. Where do we have our list of to do? Oh, somewhere,

Unknown Speaker  21:57
two types.

Unknown Speaker  22:00
It used to be here. He got moved to the bottom.

Unknown Speaker  22:31
Okay,

Unknown Speaker  22:41
so this,

Unknown Speaker  22:44
this, we haven't considered

Matthias Miller  22:56
put this in the this is really where we almost need a prioritization thing, but put it in this in the spring one and the December one and or maybe Have a maybe we just want it. Yeah, that's fine.

Matthias Miller  24:27
Resale commission. We're not handling commissions at all, but

Matthias Miller  24:42
we're original purchase amount would be probably Ray.

Speaker 1  25:07
You saying we shouldn't be handling resale commission.

Matthias Miller  25:12
I mean, we need to be, but

Unknown Speaker  25:20
we're what this is, I mean for now, it's, it's read only,

Unknown Speaker  25:33
isn't this right? It's just an RG,

Matthias Miller  25:35
okay, this part is right. But I don't know. I'm not sure how we're supposed to be handling commissions. That's, that's, that's what I'm trying to say, right?

Unknown Speaker  25:50
Do I worry? Do we worry about it right now? Where do we put a note

Matthias Miller  26:00
we should put, that's right, almost just put, I don't know, okay, put it in the should we put a To Do In The 2025 to do IDD in the 2025 Berman thing of like, do we have commissions designed correctly?

Unknown Speaker  26:28
Yeah.

Speaker 1  26:41
There be that RGB lockdown, once you pass the effective

Matthias Miller  26:57
date, oh, we're gonna copy,

Unknown Speaker  27:01
I guess that's true or not.

Matthias Miller  27:08
My My assumption was that we would freeze these values, or that these values would only be the effective date is primarily so that you can say, hey, I'm going to start charging this.

Unknown Speaker  27:17
But

Matthias Miller  27:21
yes, it should be locked down, except by super admins or something along those lines. That is one thing that's not intuitive. It's not intuitive for most people understand how dated RGS work, right?

Speaker 1  27:37
So should we, should there be an entry macro or

Matthias Miller  27:44
Yeah or not, let's do a to do IDD on with

Unknown Speaker  27:49
auto field. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  27:52
How to Do we want to use entry macros for these so there's a history, I think that that makes sense.

Speaker 2  28:09
Should we use entry macros instead of just a dated spreadsheet? Yep, what's intuitive for users?

Speaker 1  28:26
Presumably we need to free. This will allow editing currently,

Unknown Speaker  28:37
rows, unless their future

Unknown Speaker  28:51
Nick is wondering how we update available terms.

Matthias Miller  28:54
I mean, this seems like the kind of thing where a reporter, yeah, we have to write a report alert. I wish report alerts were easier to write.

Speaker 1  29:09
Yeah, we also need to be careful we don't spam report alerts. That's something we need to watch. Well, okay, we need to, but get the right number, get the right people getting them,

Matthias Miller  29:22
but, but, I mean, the other thing would be just to lock down, to warn on save, and then not let you create a contract for an unavailable term.

Matthias Miller  29:38
And so basically, to create, I like that better in a lot of ways. So I would vote if, if the if they

Matthias Miller  29:54
add a term, if the terms. If the terms on the company and the contract do not match, show a warning in the respective places saying that the following terms are not available. The following terms are not available because they must be defined on both the contract and the and the company. So

Unknown Speaker  30:28
this is in contract entry.

Matthias Miller  30:31
Well, I would No, it would be on the on the RTO, on the rental company record, and on the rental contract. And I mean, maybe it should just be a red label on there. So and then when they go to to rental and to contract entry, they won't see the term. They should ask the question, Well, why not? I thought it's in there. And they go in and it's, oh, well, that's why

Unknown Speaker  31:02
I'm starting to wonder if we might have something like that already.

Unknown Speaker  31:10
Well, that would be too easy.

Unknown Speaker  31:20
Where is his?

Unknown Speaker  31:22
Where is this Archie? It's not

Matthias Miller  31:31
a manufacturer. It's on the rental company. But I thought

Unknown Speaker  31:37
the note it kind of

Unknown Speaker  31:42
is, this? Does this not no longer exist

Matthias Miller  31:46
when a rental company is set

Speaker 1  31:49
this is on a manufacturer. It populates with one row.

Matthias Miller  31:54
Oh, never mind. Product condition, list item, okay, gracious, Oh,

Unknown Speaker  32:00
it's this thing, right? Oh, I hate

Matthias Miller  32:04
this. Yes, the discount matrix. That's what it is. Let's figure out if this is actually, let's

Unknown Speaker  32:13
take the whole,

Matthias Miller  32:17
this whole buyback and resell discount matrix. Know, the whole matrix? Oh, yeah, I would be shocked if that's a 2025, but let's put it somewhere and figure out what priority is.

Speaker 1  32:34
So we should probably hide this for now. I would, I would something.

Matthias Miller  32:39
I would Okay, let's hide it even better. I think we can just make this executive decision, go put it into, go into the spring 2026 and we can defer it from there. But it should not be spring

Speaker 1  32:54
26 Should I start building out sections underneath it, or just put it in?

Matthias Miller  32:58
Yeah, I would put this. It's speed enough openness section. I

Unknown Speaker  33:18
don't know if it's still right to keep this structure, if that's what I'm doing for now,

Matthias Miller  33:23
I think I mean, it's what we what Tim has done in similar situations. I don't think it's completely unreasonable. It's sometimes overkill, but I

Speaker 1  33:44
and so should we just remove this? Do we just built out already? Don't we just hide it?

Matthias Miller  33:53
Yeah, just just change the visibility to false. Let's do

Unknown Speaker  34:05
Wow.

Unknown Speaker  34:11
This section is hidden for now the

Unknown Speaker  34:19
this add

Unknown Speaker  34:27
a always, we will come back. You.

Unknown Speaker  35:02
Good now we think, and we have the question on, but yeah, good enough for now.

Speaker 1  35:16
This is a to do permissions for social security number.

Matthias Miller  35:23
That needs to be addressed before, yeah, yeah, previous account number. Assume that's fine. Yes, we're here. We'll change it if we need to. Um,

Unknown Speaker  35:43
we have that.

Unknown Speaker  35:50
No, we don't. Still, as you do Sean do,

Speaker 1  36:14
a so do I just leave this other to do permissions? Yeah, but

Matthias Miller  36:21
it needs to come out of the complete section somehow, okay. Or we need to move it up into the permission section. Or we need to have a Yeah, put it up in the in the permissions 230 okay.

Unknown Speaker  36:41
We have to do permissions like all through here. Do we move them all out to here?

Matthias Miller  36:50
Just put a note here to review the rest of the document for to do permissions. I mean,

Unknown Speaker  36:55
yeah, the

Speaker 1  36:56
entire document for to do permissions. Yeah. Like there's stuff here.

Unknown Speaker  37:09
Anyway, there's a lot of it do.

Unknown Speaker  37:32
I guess we can consider moving it to different sections we want to.

Matthias Miller  37:41
I mean, I think, I think that's, I think I'm happy with this.

Unknown Speaker  37:45
It's just in the main section customer then, or we

Speaker 1  37:54
might want to move that, but that's eat. I mean, do we need a notice for that? Or we can, I'm not worried.

Matthias Miller  38:00
We need to move it to the different section. We don't have to.

Speaker 1  38:03
I think Dwayne was just wondering, not sure. Oh, but I'm on it for now,

Matthias Miller  38:16
rental company, dwf. I dwf, abbreviation should at least warn if missing. And I wonder if we should just everywhere we can do a reasonable default, just assume, yeah, well, no, do an audit plus plus required or no, that's not or

Unknown Speaker  38:43
you don't think, because

Unknown Speaker  38:45
then they won't notice. Set it.

Matthias Miller  38:50
Just make it required. We're not going to be treating these automatically. That's fine.

Unknown Speaker  39:09
I need to copy this.

Speaker 1  39:28
Okay, contact, sensitive, help, sounds like something that just moves

Unknown Speaker  39:39
a simple so

Unknown Speaker  39:44
we can't ship. Can we?

Matthias Miller  39:55
Was this even the right design? Do we want it in the system itself, or do we want it. Going out to a whiskey where they can control it.

Unknown Speaker  40:08
Maybe I'm going to ship it.

Matthias Miller  40:15
Or it could be a See, I don't think it should be a wiki. I think it should be. I think it should be a help document so that, because we're gonna want to be able to control visibility for specific RTO companies, unless it is the wiki and you add, I don't know that. Like that just

Unknown Speaker  40:35
seems this sounds like a question that we bumped to December 25 Correct?

Matthias Miller  40:42
Like spring. It's a Spring release issue. We don't need help before then, and if we do, we'll build it.

Unknown Speaker  40:51
Okay? Help. Help. Help.

Unknown Speaker  41:15
Consider help for

Unknown Speaker  41:20
mental Company Settings.

Unknown Speaker  41:30
This guy, I'm just going to drop

Speaker 2  41:42
down. Oh, is all of this on there? Need

Speaker 1  41:56
to figure out layout, then more at some point, but that's not our question right now. They said the method and related fields need to be frozen on the contract.

Unknown Speaker  42:05
Aren't we

Unknown Speaker  42:09
doing that? Yeah,

Matthias Miller  42:12
yeah, I think so I'm gonna go on a go up in the 2026 or the December contract record contract definition, which we might handle it already, But since we just don't know, like, let's not do

Speaker 1  42:47
okay, merchant fee caps. I don't think we did.

Matthias Miller  42:51
No that needs to merchant fee these are not merchant fee caps, but not necessary. So we won't, but it's not necessary when we so we won't. Is this a future? This is the future? Yes, yes.

Matthias Miller  43:12
You know, it's can be really frustrating to not feel very creative. It can feel equally frustrating to have ideation, as if ability,

Unknown Speaker  43:30
good? Do we

Unknown Speaker  43:33
not seeing Wait, initiation

Unknown Speaker  43:38
method? We we have,

Unknown Speaker  43:45
where are those settings?

Matthias Miller  43:48
Well, that's, I wonder where, if I think this is the available depreciation, and then the contract definition chooses one of these. I

Speaker 1  44:04
We have them on a product,

Matthias Miller  44:09
they're on the product, that's it, you're right. There's an RG, and then on the product, do we determine which think the idea was,

Speaker 1  44:21
wait, shouldn't these actually be on the rental company and then from the product you can or not?

Matthias Miller  44:27
Yeah, it is. This is the Yeah. So the company defines which depreciation schedules are available and which is what is what this? I

Speaker 1  44:36
think it's just built wrong right now, because it's not on the company at all, and I think the RG is on the product.

Matthias Miller  44:44
Well, there is a, I don't think the RG is on the contract here menu factor, no, it would be rental companies. I. So where is that list coming from? Book schedule? It's coming from somewhere broad book depreciation methods and the height and the term year book i

Matthias Miller  45:39
What does the term year have to Do with broad book depreciation term year, it's a number

Speaker 1  46:04
it doesn't look like we're based off of, What the Oh, there's literally a to do lookup for rental company on it. Okay, well,

Matthias Miller  46:12
this needs to be done before. I mean, there's a whole depreciation thing that needs to be done. I

Unknown Speaker  46:38
um, none of this is on there. I don't think. No,

Unknown Speaker  46:47
what do I do with this note? I'm also not sure all of these are on there. Are they?

Matthias Miller  46:58
We have no we're not handling due date method.

Speaker 1  47:03
It's on there. Oh, it is. We may not be handling it.

Matthias Miller  47:20
Yeah, well, but how do we want to do it?

Unknown Speaker  47:29
Okay? Those fields are there? I think we need to figure out

Matthias Miller  47:33
how they actually work. Because right, right, that is correct.

Speaker 1  47:50
This, we all need, we need yet. What is this tax depreciation section? It's just there wasn't anything in it.

Matthias Miller  47:59
Well, I'm not even convinced that we, you talked to Dwayne. I don't think Dwayne even knows. I'm not convinced we need a tax depreciation because configuration

Unknown Speaker  48:10
to do DB take

Matthias Miller  48:13
or to do IDD, I don't know.

Unknown Speaker  48:15
Do we need this?

Unknown Speaker  48:20
Do we need custom

Unknown Speaker  48:24
X depreciation?

Unknown Speaker  48:34
We do?

Speaker 1  48:37
I think I want Nick to do this one. Well, the fielding, I don't care, But it requires linking

Unknown Speaker  48:43
up with.

Speaker 1  49:02
Well, here, how about write this up for Nick to code and work in with the existing logic on products? Does that sound right?

Matthias Miller  49:20
Sure, yeah, I think that's fair. And I'm not this, this is clearly enough spec even for you to

Unknown Speaker  49:28
Okay, yeah, so

Speaker 1  49:32
should I let you and Dwayne take it, Andrew, that first.

Matthias Miller  49:38
I mean, I think

Speaker 3  49:40
I yeah,

Matthias Miller  49:43
maybe, well, I kind of feel like it. I don't, I don't trust it well enough. I.

Speaker 1  50:05
Okay, then I'm gonna just pull that comment for now. Once I hear more, we can add it.

Unknown Speaker  50:12
We have

Speaker 1  50:14
yielding on products, but not on rental companies yet, and I'm

Speaker 1  50:29
okay, back to rental company. We have this we need to handle we need to handle it actually. Where would you put that? Due Date methods contract, which presumably contract also just needs to move up, I guess. Yeah, I mean all of probably just all of this stuff.

Unknown Speaker  51:05
Um, where

Matthias Miller  51:06
I wish it the way to do the do the ones after, okay, do like, scroll up a little bit.

Speaker 1  51:13
I want to put it after somewhere in here, probably after contact. Be fine,

Matthias Miller  51:19
265, but start at the bottom. So put retrievals in 265, and then just and then do it again. Do it again.

Unknown Speaker  51:28
Do it again. Gotcha.

Speaker 1  51:36
Gotcha. That took a while, but nice trick to the trade, this one is also hasn't happened yet. I mean, we'll expect and ready to go, but we just haven't done it 15 Same for this guy up on payments, has not happened. Yeah, I don't know what that is really

Unknown Speaker  52:09
bills.

Unknown Speaker  52:12
Bills is started but not done. But see,

Matthias Miller  52:14
that's a duplication about bound payments. But anyway, it is. Well, I mean,

Speaker 1  52:22
I think outbound payments was, let's resolve that. Then once we get up there, or should you just look at it now,

Matthias Miller  52:30
we'll put outbound payments underneath Bill record, indebted. And then, yeah,

Speaker 1  52:48
the payment record. This looks like we also need, I mean, we've ended up nuking most of this,

Matthias Miller  52:57
right, but we should review, right? We need to clean up the spec for sure and probably review. We can move it up there, and then we can clean it up and move it down.

Speaker 1  53:20
Okay, I want to make sure we were good with rental company for sure. Yeah, because, oh, due day, method was what I was thinking that we started on this whole thing

Unknown Speaker  53:32
contract.

Speaker 1  53:37
Oh, this is just a This one's absolutely no doozy. We're gonna want to start think, Huh,

Matthias Miller  53:45
break this into a million pieces, yeah, exactly.

Speaker 1  53:52
But we can get to that. Okay, I think we're good up to here. Okay? Product, record, I mean,

Unknown Speaker  54:09
there's a fair bit that's happened, but there's

Matthias Miller  54:14
product record I am not completely comfortable with. It feels like I'm not convinced it's in sync with like, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  54:28
so move it up.

Matthias Miller  54:30
I think move it up.

Unknown Speaker  54:36
Invoice. I don't think I mean,

Unknown Speaker  54:43
I think I mean it's

Matthias Miller  54:46
under active development, but it's obviously not SPECT either.

Unknown Speaker  54:52
I think is essentially done.

Matthias Miller  54:59
Accommodate your. Um,

Unknown Speaker  55:03
I mean, he has questions on reporting.

Matthias Miller  55:07
He's really interested in the report configuration stuff, okay, so we might turn it on for, like, something like even the,

Unknown Speaker  55:21
yeah, so

Speaker 1  55:27
I know that the my notes report needs work, whatever the case. Well, then let's put this up better. My notes up top, the record I'm pretty comfortable with, yeah, like I think this days, yeah, this is one of the fun things. I mean,

Matthias Miller  55:43
oh, I was just part tickled when I thought about the fact that we could use this for the contact form.

Unknown Speaker  55:52
Yeah, yeah. I mean, it's just the mean

Matthias Miller  56:00
time out to the customer, we can require a follow up. Wow.

Speaker 1  56:07
I don't have in my notes. I'll have one, I don't think, because it's dropped dead simple at this point. Kate, complete, December 25 we're going to add a

Unknown Speaker  56:18
Reports section.

Unknown Speaker  56:27
Up and then chat.

Speaker 1  56:32
We definitely need to do work on menu and reports, yet, a lot of them are pretty bare bones. Okay? I

Speaker 1  56:49
Okay, notes is good. I mean, wiki is that permissions, but yeah, okay, now that we've nuked everything.

Speaker 1  57:06
Do that. I'll lease things like that and go clean it up on my own. Then there's no reason to have you watch me create a PC for that. Yep. Note, I do, can I move this guy up? I'm wondering. This is a, I mean, or this could be a to do backlog. It's not sure. It's something that we should get before spring, probably, but isn't hugely important right now.

Matthias Miller  57:44
That sounds fair. That's fair, yeah, although I would also make an argument that if that's the case, we should just put it in the spring thing, if we really think it should be done by spring,

Speaker 1  57:54
oh, that way. I mean, right now it's not. But

Matthias Miller  57:59
if it doesn't matter, then, I mean, okay, people are going to be doing that much with that much with with double duty. I know, leave it. We could even release some spring without it. Like, okay, I think, like, right now it's dead simple, but yeah, you're right, probably right. I mean, okay, it should at least have a rental company field. Okay, that's fair, that it needs to have

Speaker 1  58:52
I will leave this in my queue now for specking. I mean, it won't take much, but I'm trying to keep moving as much as we can. Yep, fine.

Unknown Speaker  59:22
I don't know what to do with all these reporting things.

Matthias Miller  59:34
Well, let's not think about I mean, I don't either we have the reports. Why wouldn't we? I mean, we could just tell Sean to go through the section and update it with what

Unknown Speaker  59:46
is, yeah, I mean, I think we, I think that's about where it's at. I mean, I'm gonna bump this guy up where my reports. I.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:03
End. This is another property.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:12
We have all sorts of stuff hiding down here. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:00:21
wait, this isn't

Unknown Speaker  1:00:24
retrievals are like nothing at this point.

Matthias Miller  1:00:28
No, we have nothing for retrievals. There's, it does not exist. That's, that is part of

Speaker 1  1:00:35
the when. When should that be happening? We should end of year December. So it needs to happen by December,

Unknown Speaker  1:00:41
yeah, okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:00:45
for that guy, then we need a

Unknown Speaker  1:00:50
retrievals record.

Matthias Miller  1:00:52
Well, it's, we're gonna have transit tests, which is in the, it's in the overall, overall project management plan. So, so it's in there you can defer, okay, yeah, okay, because

Speaker 1  1:01:06
right now there's a retrievals record that I'm assuming is gonna either wildly change or be nuked. No,

Matthias Miller  1:01:12
I think we want it to be a transit test. We don't want it to be I think we want it to handle shed moves and gotcha, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:01:18
okay, makes sense. Yeah.

Speaker 1  1:01:37
Do we care that we have a whole bunch of custom reports for contacts like standard customers, standard

Unknown Speaker  1:01:46
manufacturers. Are we

Matthias Miller  1:01:49
literally doing custom reports, or is it just to ask from different menu options? Oh, it is literally right now. I thought it should probably be. I wondered if it should

Unknown Speaker  1:01:59
just be the standard report, well,

Matthias Miller  1:02:02
I don't understand what the advantage is of

Speaker 1  1:02:06
its fields. I mean, adding columns, but we haven't really added columns. I didn't build these guys.

Matthias Miller  1:02:13
We have entries here, but they don't actually exist in the system.

Unknown Speaker  1:02:16
Do they entries? What do you mean? Like?

Matthias Miller  1:02:20
I mean, we have menu items, but there is no standard manufacturers. There's no standard customers. There's a standard there is a standard customers. There's not manufacturers,

Speaker 1  1:02:34
okay, which is nuke? It exists?

Matthias Miller  1:02:37
Manufacturers? Yes. Nuke it Yeah, yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:02:47
Mean it's price or shits payroll should go into a future

Unknown Speaker  1:02:55
enhancements,

Unknown Speaker  1:02:56
yeah, or

Matthias Miller  1:02:58
even unscheduled feature. Unscheduled feature, almost, you almost

Unknown Speaker  1:03:08
sure I

Matthias Miller  1:03:11
could argue that unscheduled feature enhancement should actually be under at the very bottom.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:16
Oh, I mean, I can move it back if you want

Matthias Miller  1:03:22
it dashboard, yeah, maybe it's just, I think, I think it's too blue. I mean, it's beyond this,

Unknown Speaker  1:03:31
like aware,

Matthias Miller  1:03:33
well, it's hard to tell where the I mean, just put in, there's a fair number of put in 2000 and it'll drop down to the bottom, doing the unscheduled feature enhancements first and then the next one.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:46
Okay,

Matthias Miller  1:03:51
yeah, oh, sure, that works too. That really gets it down there. Um,

Matthias Miller  1:04:08
so you got the list

Unknown Speaker  1:04:11
which, yeah, do we want to spec all of these? And we have for now

Matthias Miller  1:04:17
whatever seems like every kill, but anyway, dashboards need to be completed, I believe standardized, at least we Have the demos.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:27
But that's December, right?

Matthias Miller  1:04:31
December? Yeah, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:44
Configuration reports are good.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:50
Wait, there's another.

Matthias Miller  1:04:52
Delete this one, please, and they go,

Unknown Speaker  1:04:56
I gotta save my changes because I would hate to somehow we're.

Matthias Miller  1:05:00
Um, put this into this is future ideas, data model, Core Data Elements, support options. Support options needs to go to spring and potentially billing support for December.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:39
You said billing support for September,

Unknown Speaker  1:05:41
yeah, okay, these are reports.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:00
And this guy can just go,

Unknown Speaker  1:06:03
yeah, risk

Matthias Miller  1:06:06
scoring variables, also, that entire

Speaker 1  1:06:09
does all understand the blue sky. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:06:14
that's all really, really cool stuff. But,

Unknown Speaker  1:06:22
oh, reports

Matthias Miller  1:06:24
and custom reporting. Let's see what we have to say about this stuff.

Matthias Miller  1:06:33
This is a barking of financial reports go down to is

Unknown Speaker  1:06:45
there anything we care about in here? Yeah, I don't know. I'm

Matthias Miller  1:06:47
trying to figure out why it's even here.

Speaker 1  1:06:52
I'm guessing some of these were initial ideas that were just being thrown down before we really started specking. But I don't know. Let's just throw it in

Matthias Miller  1:06:59
future ideas I don't want to think about. I'm assuming that we'll come up with. We'll come up with more specifics first, and like the translating it into the definition of what does this actually mean is a little beyond the scope of my Friday

Unknown Speaker  1:07:10
fair enough

Matthias Miller  1:07:14
Customer Portal is December.

Speaker 1  1:07:33
What about manufacturer is not an hauler or not? Both of those are. Where are those?

Matthias Miller  1:07:37
So I'm down in future for now.

Matthias Miller  1:07:55
SV document storage we have we already have, yep, just payment processing is in put this in

Matthias Miller  1:08:12
future ideas. It's documented elsewhere. What we're doing now with the future PCI vault is a long term idea compliance that's delete this. It's covered elsewhere. I don't want to. Integrations can go, yeah, integration strategy,

Unknown Speaker  1:08:34
I mean, 2000

Matthias Miller  1:08:37
this whole everything else from here is like, I'm not sure about conclusion, all that stuff is 2000s so 2000s back. So 2000

Unknown Speaker  1:08:51
native model and customer records

Matthias Miller  1:08:53
go, yep.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:57
Conclusion,

Matthias Miller  1:09:02
2003 2000 throw it down at the end. I don't know where, or you can leave it here. I don't care. I don't find notes. What are Dwayne's notes?

Speaker 1  1:09:10
He throws random ideas in here. I think I'll let him keep his notes in there.

Matthias Miller  1:09:16
Should we put it at the top?

Speaker 1  1:09:18
Oh, sure. Could put them up like, yeah, 100

Matthias Miller  1:09:23
PM, plan, sure.

Matthias Miller  1:09:30
All right, sweet, save getting closer now.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:37
Sure it'll make me happier. I

Speaker 3  1:09:40
we go.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:59
Okay.

Matthias Miller  1:10:02
So now this is where our focus is no even before that. Sorry, right. Oh, the pm for that. PM, planned

Unknown Speaker  1:10:11
dashboards. Is it? There you go.

Speaker 1  1:10:22
Um, this we never really did. Can that? Can these both just or should

Matthias Miller  1:10:26
we yeah, this, yeah, that's fine. That's good. He's we've, we've done that.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:33
Gracious. Oh.

Speaker 1  1:10:48
Hey, can't these go these were not doing for December, right? Or will we for

Matthias Miller  1:11:09
future ideas section? I mean, this should go in a separate this is definitely a 2000 I

Speaker 1  1:11:23
both of these. Yeah, I'll leave that there for now. Um, I

Unknown Speaker  1:11:47
don't know where to put these under here.

Matthias Miller  1:11:49
Just create a new reduced rent term, one for each Yep, and then customer promo.

Matthias Miller  1:12:05
No, it doesn't have to make sense in any way, shape or form.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:16
Then let me Miss merchant, Why do you not Do

Unknown Speaker  1:12:41
impact, so All righty,

Speaker 3  1:13:00
or do we need?

Matthias Miller  1:13:13
Okay? How do we want to handle things that where we don't have the date like it's the features that need design, but they don't have a data model yet. In some ways it would be, what if we had, what if we had a section above? Is this too weird? A section above that's like Dwayne and Matthias design and start putting these in the or,

Matthias Miller  1:14:00
actually, let's just put into the pm I don't care, it could go under the pm plan, but the idea is, it's only stuff that, okay, manual, so sales tax records should be the title, And we should put that bullet point in there. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:29
Control V and b do different things.

Matthias Miller  1:14:34
Or, I mean that whole section can

Unknown Speaker  1:14:35
whole thing. Okay, so this is just

Matthias Miller  1:14:39
i that needs this is why that is yes, this, this part needs spec correct. This whole section, okay, merchant processing, inspect, and needs to be a. Put needs to be put into the December 2025, section.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:07
So is this?

Matthias Miller  1:15:10
Put it under a settlement you can put it under a settlement record, which isn't completely accurate, but we know we need it anyway. So

Speaker 1  1:15:45
okay, this is one. So the, I'm gonna make sure I have all the, yeah, I've got all your all these nuts in a PC, because these do we start flopping onto records like fielding for contract, etc, okay, I'm going to put it on contract driven just an auto pay.

Matthias Miller  1:16:17
Yeah, I like that a lot. Perfect. Do

Matthias Miller  1:16:37
and then on the payment we need this is

Speaker 1  1:16:39
this the only thing you really need marked out for auto pay? Right? Yes, and

Matthias Miller  1:16:50
then the other one can go under the payment record. You could have

Unknown Speaker  1:16:53
it. We're December. You

Speaker 2  1:17:15
you, that's fine. I don't get mugged. No, just kidding. I really good.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:24
What's going on over there?

Matthias Miller  1:17:27
I was asking if I mind its back doors open. It's always weird when people don't know if you're joking or not. I

Speaker 3  1:17:40
I'm good.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:45
I want to add a PC to this guy. No, this is, I'm going to say,

Unknown Speaker  1:18:19
contract definition is

Speaker 3  1:18:20
handle

Matthias Miller  1:18:26
optional leafs some states. This needs a to do spec.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:35
Leave it in here.

Matthias Miller  1:18:38
Well, we could maybe figure it out.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:39
I um, the

Unknown Speaker  1:18:44
contract definition record will just need a lot of work yet. Put

Matthias Miller  1:18:50
this in the contract definition. That's fine. Put in the contract definition. We'll flush it out when

Speaker 2  1:18:58
we get there. I think that's fine. I I think

Matthias Miller  1:19:10
part of what would make this more manageable as well is ditching these. Well, ditchings, what we're doing two things, just organization is like, no, that's basic thing, I think. And then taking these million mile proposals and breaking them into manageable pieces as well. The other issue too is that Dwayne and I both have low tolerance for this. Some of these things are things that Tim would naturally Chase, like all these really obnoxious education corners details,

Unknown Speaker  1:19:46
we lose patience, yeah,

Speaker 1  1:19:51
and I'm not used to doing this, and I'm also not a Tim either,

Matthias Miller  1:19:56
yeah, exactly. So we just got to figure out how to do it. We'll figure out how to do, yeah, partial refunds. Put this under, under the spring when,

Matthias Miller  1:20:11
dude, I can't wait to get this RTO stuff in there. RTO Pro, what about RTO Pro, I think, I think we'll be able to, Dwayne doesn't want to talk too loud about it, because he doesn't want private equity fund to get or private equity owner to get free. But so I told him, just don't tell anybody. You can suck the sequel out, but we can have nightly stinks. And my thought is, we'll have, we'll create a database level, database levels to replicate the SQL tables and field names that mirror that for RTO Pro X 30s that match on on field names. And literally, in half a day, you can get, oh, is this for the big onload? It's not for the No, it's not for the big guys. No, it's It's to migrate from the from the behemoth the industry.

Speaker 1  1:21:10
Yeah, gotcha. So what's the what's he concerned about?

Matthias Miller  1:21:18
So that that software got bought out by a private equity company, and if they find out that their competitor is sucking SQL data out for seamless migration, they might try to find a way to lock down access To the sequels or SQL stuff. Gotcha, gotcha. That's what he's concerned about. So how does it, which wouldn't be that hard. All you have to do is, is add a private key in your software and use a, I mean, it'll slow down your database, which is probably it should be, should be some concern for them, because it's dog slow already. But just write it as an encrypted file with the private key and it, I mean, I don't know, is it encrypted file? It's not that hard, but you think, but I don't know.

Speaker 1  1:22:08
So they don't have nice, I mean, you can suck that out. But other than that, they don't really have data export stuff.

Matthias Miller  1:22:14
No, they have a SQL browser. And so there is a manual way you could do it, but it's not feasible for automation.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:21
Gotcha. So

Speaker 1  1:22:22
why would you want to nightly sync? Is that when you're converting across, like slowly switching,

Matthias Miller  1:22:28
converting across, okay, being able to run simultaneously, I don't know, for a bit,

Unknown Speaker  1:22:35
gotcha. Okay?

Unknown Speaker  1:22:40
Customer Portal

Matthias Miller  1:22:43
section for Customer Portal,

Matthias Miller  1:22:51
actually, I wonder if they should stay, though, on the design. Yeah, we do. Does this need to stay?

Matthias Miller  1:23:02
How do we want to it is a December 2025 goal still requires some level of design, right?

Unknown Speaker  1:23:18
I like

Matthias Miller  1:23:20
Dwayne and I to know that what anything that's in our court is in a section. So that's my that's my argument. Keep this is still in our court. There's been no handoff whatsoever. Leave it here, but tell me I'm crazy. No, I don't mind. As long as it does get hit, we could put these. We Yeah, anyway, yeah. Let's, let's, let's do like that and wrap up payment portal. Can go database connected for RTO pro should stay here. Contract entry needs to be somewhere. I thought we should. We surely talked about it.

Speaker 1  1:23:55
We don't have payment portal listed in here. I guess we know we need to wrap that up before,

Matthias Miller  1:24:03
but you could put it in here. There's the merchant processing, though, is the main thing. But although payment portal, there may be other stuff.

Unknown Speaker  1:24:33
Okay, contact entry that needs, spec, right?

Matthias Miller  1:24:41
Yes, massively, appreciation, schedule needs, spec, images, invoicing, methodology does past due, letter creation, does logistics, does clean up. Spec is what we're doing.

Speaker 1  1:24:58
Maybe that guy, because we know. Like, we know

Matthias Miller  1:25:03
record for bills can go runtime configuration for key reports is like,

Speaker 1  1:25:10
which reports need to know which reports, so I'm gonna leave that here. Yep.

Matthias Miller  1:25:22
Um, Analysis Report, yeah, it still needs to be there. Accounting. Accounting is close enough to underway. Payment record.

Unknown Speaker  1:25:35
Oh, here's Nick has some confusion. You said to do the same. This is

Speaker 1  1:25:42
on the invoice, the same auto populate, if it's the same for all rows. What's the what does that mean?

Matthias Miller  1:25:57
Do you know how contacts work on the transaction record. Not really gonna pull up a new transaction record,

Matthias Miller  1:26:15
okay, so select a contact, okay, and then put in a debit amount. Add a new row, this guy defaults to that contact. Add a new row, default to that contact. Now change the contact on one of those rows on the right now, it says multiple contacts up top. You add a new contact, it's blank. I see go change the contact at the top again, and it changes all of them.

Unknown Speaker  1:26:58
Understood. So it was

Matthias Miller  1:27:00
clear in my head. Those are terrible words to describe it. Very clear in my head that does make sense. It just didn't.

Speaker 1  1:27:10
Doing this, doing it the same for all rows, if it was the same for all rows, wasn't quite tracking. Hilarious. Okay, so basically, we should have add an entry macro, is this right?

Unknown Speaker  1:27:32
Or

Unknown Speaker  1:27:37
account and product ID, is that what you're thinking?

Unknown Speaker  1:27:46
Yeah, well,

Matthias Miller  1:27:55
add non RG entry, entry, yes. Um. If all rows share the same value, show that in the entry macro, if not show a quote, you know, ampersand multiple quote, and then change the on init, where, if it says multiple, then you need it to blank. Otherwise it did it to what the entry macro shows. I know that's not there

Speaker 1  1:28:29
are multiple. There are multiple, multiple accounts listed in the RG show multiple

Unknown Speaker  1:28:48
in the helper list.

Unknown Speaker  1:28:51
Changing the helper list should set

Unknown Speaker  1:28:56
all rows on init

Unknown Speaker  1:29:01
If the entry macro is set,

Speaker 1  1:29:21
do the same as multiple counts, as the RG show multiple developer list should set all rows if the entry macro is Set one, okay, the entry macro returns one account, multiple, well be redundant, but yes, then r, then init to that account, otherwise, there, that makes so much more sense.

Unknown Speaker  1:30:01
Yep, okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:30:09
this I'm

Speaker 1  1:30:16
going to move to invoices. I need to clean up spec on invoices. But I know that's one of the things I need to do. I just

Unknown Speaker  1:30:27
haven't had time. Sure,

Speaker 1  1:30:33
I'll get to that and invoices we're wanting to link to payments. This we spec together. Just need to

Unknown Speaker  1:31:00
do it, or

Unknown Speaker  1:31:03
delegate cleanup, Spark and delegate. I'm

Speaker 1  1:31:07
going to put as a separate row for now, it'll be easy for me to find. I think I'm

Unknown Speaker  1:31:23
and

Unknown Speaker  1:31:27
payment record me To add these guys.

Unknown Speaker  1:31:42
Payment l, A,

Unknown Speaker  1:31:52
indexes,

Unknown Speaker  1:32:18
like to do. Oops.

Speaker 1  1:32:30
Okay, this, I don't care about we have those documented.

Unknown Speaker  1:32:39
Hey, what's this stuff? Oh,

Speaker 1  1:32:43
sorry, products, sales is this just wait, yes, accounting impact, I think I have PCs for both of these configuration and configurations live, standardizing reports, not yet.

Unknown Speaker  1:33:09
If I have job for that,

Speaker 1  1:33:15
yes, I have a product change for that. So once you this is we're waiting on you to fill out the fielding on the accounting company. Yep, yep. I'm going to add

Unknown Speaker  1:33:36
a do Seth,

Unknown Speaker  1:33:39
make sure the counting impact reports are standardized. Let me paste.

Speaker 1  1:33:54
I am liking doing this, because then we can, if we see this a month from now, like, Oh, someone forgot to update the to do. Well, we can pop open the job, say, Oh yeah, we coded it, or, Oh no, we didn't. Let's do that

Matthias Miller  1:34:06
exactly we should. Does? Does zch Still have did we kill the product? Change thinking in zch?

Speaker 1  1:34:18
It changed majorly. I don't know if I it got dumber, didn't it much dumber? Much, much dumber.

Matthias Miller  1:34:26
I think you should. It wasn't there a list for it? Oh, Change IDs. Okay, yeah, we still have the records. Yeah, the records, we just

Unknown Speaker  1:34:41
import, very important,

Matthias Miller  1:34:43
it's just import only or something, right? It's not bi directional or something. No, it's not do these. So why aren't these here? PC, I want to check I'm.

Speaker 1  1:35:00
Oh, you're curious why the bracket, bracket doesn't work right. What if we pulled it? Did you pull it? We could bring it back easily. Does that? Well, why would

Matthias Miller  1:35:12
you were doing? What make it go into cls? Oh, how do you I guess it has to go to a record, doesn't it? I think so. But you could have it, but the PC, I'll bet you, the PC record actually exists. You just build an R 20 that, no, it pulls up the record. You would add a client scope, link to the record itself, and have it product change record itself. So it's a click and a click. Yeah, it's

Speaker 1  1:35:45
a bummer. You can't for me, it's almost as fast. Just copy the product change and

Matthias Miller  1:35:52
you just do it. Yep, dude, boom, I agree. Boom. All right, so we got secure doc, document handling, automate, okay, I think the rest of this stuff is okay, spring. Then we said sales taxes before that. So kill sales tax. There TSA integration, the shed app, okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:36:25
it's like pre check or something.

Matthias Miller  1:36:28
So move, move TSA and the post launch. Voicemail, drop message, I like the post launch. Auto dialer, actually, all of this stuff from spring down to voice message goes into no hang on. Sorry, spring goes into spring. I know it's shocking.

Unknown Speaker  1:36:48
Wait, What?

Unknown Speaker  1:36:51
What?

Unknown Speaker  1:36:53
No way I

Speaker 1  1:37:08
and voila, doesn't want to There we go. KSA integration, that's my favorite thing I found in this proposal yet.

Matthias Miller  1:37:20
Okay, and then future, the future and The post launch can go into future. I'm

Unknown Speaker  1:37:45
uh, as

Speaker 1  1:37:47
what do you label these as I want? Do you want separate ones for like auto dialer and voicemail drop, voice message,

Matthias Miller  1:37:57
phone integration for those two? Okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:38:01
what about the other one?

Matthias Miller  1:38:04
RTO run logistics.

Matthias Miller  1:38:12
One of us should, once we get this even further fleshed out, one of us should print out a copy and mail it in the mail. You know, priority mail envelope to Dwayne,

Speaker 1  1:38:26
just so he realizes how much has been happening.

Unknown Speaker  1:38:29
That'd be hilarious.

Speaker 1  1:38:39
I mean, here I'm curious what the word counts at right now.

Matthias Miller  1:38:43
Oh, you can, yeah, there you go. You just turn it on there. Oh, that's true.

Speaker 1  1:38:49
26,000 how does that compare to? It's bigger than, well, it's, but we're, you're also not as verbose as Tim. So,

Matthias Miller  1:38:59
no, exactly.

Unknown Speaker  1:39:03
Because I'm pretty sure it's a far bigger system than easy tally, right?

Matthias Miller  1:39:10
I would think it's more similar, but maybe it is bigger.

Unknown Speaker  1:39:14
Okay, I don't know. I haven't I actually don't know. Easy tell you, well so

Matthias Miller  1:39:19
easy tell you've got some weird, I don't know,

Unknown Speaker  1:39:24
yeah, fair enough.

Matthias Miller  1:39:26
That's fascinating. This is all super interesting.

Matthias Miller  1:39:38
This makes sense. Anyway, sweet.

Speaker 1  1:39:43
That's hilarious. I worked on Waverly way back in the day,

Unknown Speaker  1:39:50
like 2017 I think something like that. It was a long time ago.

Unknown Speaker  1:39:58
It's crazy. I.

Unknown Speaker  1:40:04
All right, so then,

Unknown Speaker  1:40:08
what is

Matthias Miller  1:40:09
those three can go those are all redundant. The to do's, do we really need a to do dictionary? I guess we could. It

Speaker 1  1:40:17
doesn't hurt, because we just added like to do backlog

Matthias Miller  1:40:21
So, but let's not put it in the pm section, please. Right? This can go, that can go,

Unknown Speaker  1:40:33
what do you want to put it in? I

Unknown Speaker  1:40:45
to do, to do,

Matthias Miller  1:40:47
to do lists, to do references,

Speaker 1  1:40:52
to do index. Yeah, that's sure something. It doesn't matter that much.

Matthias Miller  1:41:00
Okay, major design updates can go

Speaker 1  1:41:05
where major Oh, oh, Ellis wanted to, he was wanting to keep track of what are things that weren't in the original scope that we

Matthias Miller  1:41:15
Oh, my goodness.

Speaker 1  1:41:19
Is that something we can compile later. But like, notes was an easy one that I thought of that wasn't the original scope and we added, but maybe there's a whole lot more. He was just trying to think, if we start documenting, then we if we go over, then we can explain

Matthias Miller  1:41:44
I Yeah, but I don't,

Unknown Speaker  1:41:51
I mean, I think we sort of know,

Unknown Speaker  1:41:54
yeah, okay.

Unknown Speaker  1:42:06
This is done right

Matthias Miller  1:42:09
levels to the inspects turn on. I mean, it's everything else will be close enough. User reports are done. Users assist for creating an importing is done, accounting events.

Speaker 1  1:42:26
Oh, wait, I'm Rosie. I skipped some stuff. Here it this is all this stuff is all done,

Matthias Miller  1:42:33
right? Well, it's not negotiable for demo. So I would sure hope so exactly do

Matthias Miller  1:42:46
um, oh, this is just

Matthias Miller  1:42:57
gracious. What sells the software can go. I just don't think it's that. I don't know maybe it's useful, but contract closures probably should be contract closures. What are we like that? Sorry, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:43:20
retrievals. Where do you want to put notes?

Matthias Miller  1:43:22
I mean, just this, this is feels to me like it's been beaten to death, and we probably have it somewhere, but for the life of me, that should probably be in the contract definition. I don't know. Like it's just in the contract definition. Oh, sorry, in the contract, in the contract. I'm sorry, contract record. I

Unknown Speaker  1:43:49
here.

Matthias Miller  1:43:51
Okay, good. I'm happy.

Speaker 1  1:43:59
Counting events. It does go under any impact, or do you want to have them in here for design?

Matthias Miller  1:44:06
Actually, that reminds me, just only lists, count,

Unknown Speaker  1:44:19
event types, copy list definition.

Matthias Miller  1:44:28
Well, here we should have a in account. Event types, ACCT, event types, list with Do we not have one these options. We don't have anything in it, CRT and and we should have those, those options in there,

Unknown Speaker  1:44:59
and turn off user. Missions or leave them for

Matthias Miller  1:45:01
now. Yes, turn it off, turn it off and and hard code and cut PCs in.

Speaker 1  1:45:05
Let me just where did you send it? Signal? I

Speaker 1  1:45:24
Yeah, I'll just, I saved it on my end. I'll just commit

Matthias Miller  1:45:27
it awesome. So then that could also be documented at some point too, but that's so all this stuff. I think accounting events can go. I

Matthias Miller  1:45:48
along with the to do dB, the EPO is handled. I believe,

Unknown Speaker  1:45:57
know if I need to be dumping stuff in history, but it makes

Matthias Miller  1:46:00
me I don't know either. It kind of does me too. And then I look at it and I'm like, that it's really like, just a lot wrong.

Unknown Speaker  1:46:10
It's sort of like hoarding, okay, you might need it in the future. Your cheek. I mean, did I wrong?

Matthias Miller  1:46:30
Well, the way that I've known some people in the past who accumulated, accumulate those relationships like the history, the history memo, it's

Speaker 3  1:46:40
mouth.

Unknown Speaker  1:46:44
That's terrifying.

Matthias Miller  1:46:52
Beyond that, but anyway, cancel everything up until canceled building can be deleted.

Matthias Miller  1:47:02
God, needs to go into accounting impact somewhere.

Speaker 1  1:47:22
Not sure this is really under scheduled tasks, but, well,

Unknown Speaker  1:47:37
I'll be good for now and we can collapse it then,

Unknown Speaker  1:47:39
right?

Matthias Miller  1:47:45
Okay, how do we want to document? Or should we just leave it like insight and nobody knows how it works.

Speaker 1  1:47:54
I feel like it would be worth documenting reserve, but that's a whole project in and of itself, isn't it? Maybe it's not too bad

Matthias Miller  1:48:07
this is not this one's not complicated, okay, I think it's just as simple as basically saying. I think the most important thing is saying, These are the transactions that get created, and this is where they come from. This is where the this is what accounts that you what settings on the accounting company gets used. Here's a debit or credit amount.

Unknown Speaker  1:48:42
Um, lot

Matthias Miller  1:48:44
of this stuff, the payment the next

Matthias Miller  1:48:55
like payment building and invoices, the only reason to keep it is if this is the starting point of a spec. But I don't really feel like that's that helpful. I think we just Nix it and we recreate it from scratch. Bill Payment slash vendor, invoice and transit task need to go under accounting impact somehow. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:49:51
are you wanting to still consider No? Identify. Oh, we need to

Matthias Miller  1:50:13
get this configurable date we're

Matthias Miller  1:50:26
presumably, because that building, we want to run off the loss.

Matthias Miller  1:50:35
Okay, the the presumably, if we close out the Building, bullet can go, okay.

Unknown Speaker  1:50:53
Refunds,

Matthias Miller  1:51:01
okay, I would say, under refunds to a proposed design,

Matthias Miller  1:51:18
override forgiveness account, and then checkbox Plus account list in parentheses, and

Matthias Miller  1:51:35
then override refund account as A second, yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:51:54
gain or loss can go.

Matthias Miller  1:52:06
Um, rental use tax. This can go as well, yeah, security deposits, negative can go. Rental use tax needs to hang around. Sales tax can go. That one should probably say a to do, or just take the to do out, just outdin it. What's the shortcut Control? Left Bracket, left square bracket, right.

Matthias Miller  1:52:57
Next. One can go it's duplicate. Sam, sample dashboards link. The rest of that stuff can go but the link should go with the dashboard section. Um,

Matthias Miller  1:53:32
okay, then we have the that's still for Dwayne. Do we need if Dwayne doesn't think we need to push it to accounting, let's Move the proposal for free cash to the dashboard section.

Unknown Speaker  1:54:07
Just inside the dashboard section. That's fine.

Matthias Miller  1:54:09
I love how they call it precache. It's so not the definition of whatever. Even from accounting space, it's so far from i

Unknown Speaker  1:54:27
i don't

Matthias Miller  1:54:33
handle forgiveness and late fees, needs to go into the contract the override due date. Take that with it, override due date, and then on the main screen, include the show calculated, Yeah, that guy, this one goes to contract as well. Yeah. And then updated, no, that stick that over there.

Matthias Miller  1:55:17
The updated contract, the updated model, data model can be probably should be archived, sales tax payments, deferred fees. Yeah, no, Mr. Here, yeah, that's really all we need

Matthias Miller  1:55:50
handle. Partial refunds came as a duplicate checking cash refunds needs to be here. Should go under contract. I think it should just create a bill to the customer, move it to contract, and then say, I think it should create a bill to the customer, from the customer. I

Unknown Speaker  1:56:24
create a bill from the cast. You said,

Matthias Miller  1:56:27
Yeah, from the customer. I

Matthias Miller  1:56:43
The late fees. We went, Oh, here, well, I don't want to think about deferrals. I think it requires some specking or something. I'm not even sure I'm getting brightening lately for late fees. I think we handled that Warren when refunding if it will create a late fee that should go into the late fee, stuff that should go into the payment or that. So payment portal, yeah, I

Matthias Miller  1:57:32
Oh, I think the to do for late fees can go. Andrew only considers a percentage of the of the payment to be rent. The rental

Unknown Speaker  1:57:41
portion didn't we do that?

Matthias Miller  1:57:47
We split it out. But do we want this to be up

Unknown Speaker  1:58:02
like only, accounting company,

Matthias Miller  1:58:15
contract. It's

Matthias Miller  1:58:22
so here's the thing, we have rental fee going to a single that needs to move into, that needs to be a to do DB for Dwayne, or to do IDD, one of those, whether we need to, if these need to hit accounting differently here, yeah, to do, yeah, two dB. Does this need to hit accounting? Do we? Do we need to split rental payments and to different revenue accounts?

Speaker 3  1:59:00
Okay,

Matthias Miller  1:59:13
they want to depreciate the entire thing out On the last month.

Matthias Miller  1:59:38
Do we have something for EPO? EO up in the also add a to do. DB, do we want EPO income or EPO revenue in a different account?

Matthias Miller  2:00:03
And both of this stuff, both of these two should go like this in the series of bullets above the Andrew from starting from Andrew, these should go right under the management fees above, yeah, in there. Yep.

Matthias Miller  2:00:26
Patient reports received. Date is important. We track data. Do we track date of receipt? Nobody, the depreciation start date. So yes, you'll want in their engine. Ones posted a retail movie to Cox. It'll cross it will be on the books as an inventory asset.

Unknown Speaker  2:00:58
Scroll down,

Matthias Miller  2:01:04
okay, everything from my 911 comment, that top entire top 911 comment can

Matthias Miller  2:01:18
be archived the when a building.

Matthias Miller  2:01:26
That needs to go up in that it needs to go up the what a building is retrieved needs to go up a section right on the heels of the other accounting impact

Matthias Miller  2:01:40
questions, miscellaneous, For every $40

Matthias Miller  2:01:49
I understand now, right?

Matthias Miller  2:02:02
We need a report. It should probably be in here, a report on deferred revenue by team member.

Unknown Speaker  2:02:11
Where do you want that? Just here?

Speaker 1  2:02:15
Or should I put it in the December? Um, which were you thinking?

Unknown Speaker  2:02:30
Give me one minute.

Matthias Miller  2:02:39
December, no spring, we're not going to have enough data to get deferral that we care about. Deferrals do

Unknown Speaker  2:03:08
Ah,

Unknown Speaker  2:03:11
wow, I'm struggling.

Unknown Speaker  2:03:30
I have anything copy, no

Matthias Miller  2:03:40
loss rates for You

Speaker 1  2:03:42
want to move that out there, yes,

Unknown Speaker  2:03:54
yeah. No,

Matthias Miller  2:04:16
okay, take my last 911 comment and archive it, and then whole thing, let's Yes, and then I want to handle the investor stuff out of there.

Matthias Miller  2:04:36
So let's go back up to go to the TV permissions section,

Matthias Miller  2:04:48
consider investor level permissions.

Speaker 1  2:04:55
I think we're both more used to typing investor tools than investor i. We can't, we can't

Matthias Miller  2:05:01
write investor,

Unknown Speaker  2:05:03
investor.

Matthias Miller  2:05:07
All right, back to pm plan. So could we

Speaker 1  2:05:14
it's now just over yonder.

Matthias Miller  2:05:19
Okay, it's still almost too long. Let's create quick, quick customer portal in a sub sub section. I

Unknown Speaker  2:05:47
accounting impact in some section. Maybe, yep,

Matthias Miller  2:05:51
that's exactly

Unknown Speaker  2:06:02
that's all this, right?

Matthias Miller  2:06:04
Yeah, that's that entire thing there. And I think once you get that past that, most of this other stuff is actually, there you go. That's actually, that's manage it all, dude.

Speaker 1  2:06:22
Now, clean up contracts and contract definitions and

Matthias Miller  2:06:28
Okay, well, I don't know how you want to spend your Friday, but I think it's fair to say I have gotten enough out of this. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  2:06:39
So, yeah,

Speaker 1  2:06:42
sounds good. Should we book a time next week to work on cleaning up further stuff? Yes, because we do, we really need to contract and contract definition, I think, are the two big ones for on my for me to be pushing forward clean then we can work on it.

Matthias Miller  2:07:06
When do you

Matthias Miller  2:07:17
want to just missed close to rearranging my whole life. I wonder that is two hours. Could we do?

Matthias Miller  2:07:43
You guys still probably don't want to do your only check in at 12. Do you Central? That's probably a bad time on Thursdays.

Unknown Speaker  2:07:54
It's not i Well, how long? It's probably not ideal.

Matthias Miller  2:08:01
The other option would be doing it at like 1145 it's usually 15 minutes. Yeah, that's a weird time though. 1130 it gets 2030 like that. I'm trying to, I would love to. I have Thursday's my day when I like it's my recurring right? I could do it and I could free up my Monday, then I can have way more open days. What time do you start work on? On Monday?

Speaker 1  2:08:36
Um, I mean, the goal is 830 ish, but if I'm happy to push things earlier, if I know beforehand

Unknown Speaker  2:08:46
fairly, I

Matthias Miller  2:08:51
don't know that it really matters.

Unknown Speaker  2:08:53
How about does

Matthias Miller  2:08:58
it make a difference to you? Just from your standpoint, morning or afternoon,

Unknown Speaker  2:09:06
it's not a huge deal. I mean, I think we just

Matthias Miller  2:09:10
make it work. Okay, let's do let's take something and I'll go before it. Go with it. How about we do one central Okay, sounds good. I

Matthias Miller  2:09:26
Oh, well, 830 Hang on. But if we did 830 I could still potentially get Dwayne in the afternoon. 930 if

Unknown Speaker  2:09:41
we did eight to

Matthias Miller  2:09:45
Okay, a good thing we could almost work better, is if you're willing to start just a little bit earlier. We could do eight to eight, eight to eight to 10 on Monday. Yeah. And then. Would let us hopefully get it in a good place before, because it's a little further down the road before. Yeah, exactly. Dwayne's not available then. Anyway, all right, sweet.

Speaker 1  2:10:10
Sounds good. I feel much better about this whole project after making this

Matthias Miller  2:10:15
artist. It makes I don't I'm seeing how much work there is.

Speaker 1  2:10:19
Oh, I easy to ignore what to me Go ahead, to me, it felt like there was way more. Oh, like, I know there's still a lot, but now that it starts, the fog starts clearing a little bit on what actually needs to happen. Then, then I feel like, oh, I can actually move. If it's not just all a haze, right? There's actually definitive target that you can get to. Yep, I know we've got, I think pushing to get it done by early December is gonna stretch us. We're gonna have to work hard. Yeah, I think

Matthias Miller  2:10:52
I would, don't disagree, and I wonder if we should even triage. I don't know how. We probably need to take what we have slated for them and triage that even harder and have like a January or something or a February. I don't know if there's anything there, but All right, good.

Speaker 1  2:11:14
And we also know that, like when we're onboarding Dwayne, then we don't care if the menu is far from perfect. We don't care if reports need work. They just tell us what they need, and we build it

Matthias Miller  2:11:24
like, yeah, the same with the other guy too. I mean, that's, that's, that's exactly what you're getting. That's what he gets if you sign on early exactly, but you get early access and you get input into the system, so Exactly.

Speaker 1  2:11:37
Okay, all right. Well, thank you very much. You bet stuff done. We got stuff done. We got stuff done. It's great. Okay, thank you.
