Matthias Miller  04:16
Say, Hey, good morning.

Speaker 1  08:15
Amen, got me

Unknown Speaker  08:20
no, sorry, I'm not there yet. Oh, you're muted.

Unknown Speaker  08:24
I think

Matthias Miller  08:27
there we go. Try that.

Unknown Speaker  08:30
All right, what's up, man here, share.

Speaker 1  08:42
Okay. Yep, all right, what do we want

Matthias Miller  08:47
to do? We want to dive in.

Unknown Speaker  08:50
There was something

Matthias Miller  08:52
last week we were talking about that we needed to talk about. And I it did.

Speaker 2  08:59
So, yeah, we I've let me look here in my notes, sorry, assembly analysis and reports, that was last time we said talked about to do list was creating a daily or bi weekly value reports, then Bridget to payroll. Maybe this, I wrote this down, but I did a report, and I did pull up a like, a 210, day. 14 day window report. And it's, it's great. I mean, I was able to navigate in the reports window and get what I needed that I get rid of this

Matthias Miller  09:56
and what, and I, and I actually just broke that report. I.

Speaker 2  10:00
There we go. Now, if I go in right now, analysis reports it looks like,

Matthias Miller  10:07
yeah, sorry, I screwed some stuff up. Let me

Unknown Speaker  10:22
I was,

Matthias Miller  10:30
I was making some changes, and I should have been a little slower to Push update. That's the bottom line. Uh, uh about uh,

Unknown Speaker  11:40
I think Matt, can I pop out for a minute?

Matthias Miller  12:13
Yep, yep, I'll get about five. Perfect. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  16:44
Thanks, that's super good of you.

Unknown Speaker  16:49
Appreciate you

Unknown Speaker  16:51
blessings

Unknown Speaker  16:58
from the Lord.

Unknown Speaker  17:04
You still on that

Matthias Miller  17:06
map. All right, refresh, okay,

Unknown Speaker  17:13
okay, good, good. So,

Speaker 2  17:31
yeah, I guess I'm um, I kind of need a little maybe. I mean, I got this to work yesterday I entered, I can't remember which one I What did I use, which dates I had,

Unknown Speaker  17:49
the second here.

Unknown Speaker  17:54
I was just looking at two week windows. They pay 119,

Unknown Speaker  18:00
420.

Speaker 2  18:04
So like six, five to 618, it's got a memory. I like that. Man, that's awesome. I was doing all customers, all items,

Unknown Speaker  18:19
what's team match. If you open it up,

Matthias Miller  18:24
drop list, so do you it's, it's how to do teams. So you can find, you can filter by any work order that has exactly these employees, any any work orders that has all of these or more, or team members with any of these employees. So if you want to look at any time, yeah, yeah. I mean, that's, that's what it is. And then as soon as you select that, you can say you can select the people that go with

Speaker 2  18:51
it. If I do all, is there a difference between blank all and include any teams with all well,

Matthias Miller  19:02
blank. So if you leave it blank, it's just it's not going to filter by team. If you do include, I guess, if you include and don't select anybody, either it's going to return everybody anyway, or it's just going to include, or it's going to come back blank. I don't know which leave that

Speaker 2  19:21
blank? Yeah. Primary grouping would be day. Secondary grouping would be team. I think that's what I did, sure to get an accurate report of

Matthias Miller  19:39
all right, let's go, let me, let me replicate that and see what's going on. Okay, so we have what were the dates?

Unknown Speaker  19:46
Six, five to 618,

Matthias Miller  19:49
618, group by Cust group, day and then by team.

Unknown Speaker  19:57
All right, what's going on here?

Unknown Speaker  20:04
String backstage index,

Speaker 2  20:20
No, you're good, man, I'm. It's not like I'm. I'm gonna scramble or anything on my side. Okay? I

Unknown Speaker  22:29
um,

Matthias Miller  22:41
we don't have any from that range, do we?

Unknown Speaker  22:46
Ah, sorry, Matt,

Matthias Miller  22:49
go do the assembly tracker,

Unknown Speaker  22:53
any what from that range?

Matthias Miller  22:56
No, that's not right. Never mind. Hang on. Let me, let me. Let me chase

Unknown Speaker  23:03
it did I I'm not sure if I did anything wrong or not. Six primary grouping.

Unknown Speaker  23:15
We go from.

Matthias Miller  23:18
We go from on our historical ones. We are our historical ones. Only came through May 23 and then we started entering on 623, so you just managed to pick a pay period. I think that we don't have anything. Let me make sure this. Let me check something else now. Okay,

Speaker 2  23:37
that was before this was, this was migration time. Yeah, is that why?

Matthias Miller  23:46
Yeah, you picked a window between. There's a small window from when I had the old tracker, and we started inputting new stuff, and then when we decided to change how we were importing it, I think, I think that's why that that that gap is blank. So if you want to do, can we do a pay period from after,

Speaker 2  24:06
yeah, because Matthias would go back to Excel. And we're talking about, we need to clean up the Excel entries. Yep.

Matthias Miller  24:21
All right, so let's find a pay period after John. John T started in here,

Speaker 2  24:26
um, that's scary too, because it's still not done cleaning Well, yeah, he said he was texting you this morning, yeah.

Matthias Miller  24:42
I got some stuff to check into on that front

Unknown Speaker  24:44
me. Okay, did that make sense? I gotta

Matthias Miller  24:48
chase a little bit of that stuff I want to talk to, yeah. But as far as running the analysis, even if it's bad numbers, can we, can we at least make sure you know how to run the

Unknown Speaker  24:57
Yeah? I mean. Let me

Matthias Miller  25:01
good with that. Let's not. No need to beat a dead horse,

Unknown Speaker  25:06
right? So the one was okay, let's go here.

Speaker 3  25:18
That was seven, 731 31 to I'm not

Unknown Speaker  25:27
real fast here, 813, primary grouping, dad, secondary grouping was team. Yeah. So here we got and then I was coming over here, and I was going using this as the drop down, which I thought was cool. I could do that. Yep.

Speaker 2  25:54
Value produced this number, the dollars. Um, what we're using for incentive is the total dollars right here in the bottom 48

Unknown Speaker  26:10
Yep, uh, the scoring is something I want to talk to you about, but before we get off the phone here, but for my next step of incentive program, score is not important. So let's again. Here's the thing, so I needed,

Matthias Miller  26:31
I have another question. Is there a way if dollar value translates nicely to

Matthias Miller  26:49
if dollar value translates nicely to effort required, then couldn't you set a Target production dollar value, and then couldn't you set a target time for any order,

Unknown Speaker  27:10
yeah, and

Matthias Miller  27:11
anytime an order goes out, you say, like, and I don't know. I kind of feel like, I don't know it sounds simple on the surface, I'm kind of concerned. There's, there's, like, hidden potholes, with the with the idea, or landmines or something. But,

Speaker 2  27:30
well, no, definitely, it's definitely, it's not a fresh, new thought in my mind, but it's, I

Speaker 1  27:40
I'm

Speaker 2  27:47
way too visionary, man. I don't know if I'm right. I think I'm in the right spot, but I don't know what my future holds. But like, right away, I'm thinking of all the possibilities, but, um, so like practical, sometimes you got to walk through stuff in order to actually do stuff, right? So, oh yeah. So practical is okay, so we so that's the goal. So then we just assign that to each one. It goes on to the schedule. Um, but then what's then, what's accountability? How do you what's the accountability metric? So there's an accountability there. But how do we and how do we enforce accountability? How do we enforce, sounds unkind, sounds labor campish. How do we? How do how do we reward? I think we want to come at it from a reward standpoint, right? Not an important step. So how do we reward properly reward? I should probably say that word every day so that I don't get lazy tongue as I get older. How do we properly reward that? I mean, that's the that's that idea that thought that rewarding as a motivator is the reason we're here and having this conversation. Um,

Matthias Miller  29:35
well, okay, let's talk about the behaviors we want to have happen. We want the guys out the shop to be all excited. Be like, Come on, guys, let's crank this thing out. Like, if we, this is so, so stupid simple. Like, if we just, let's just get on top of it. And hey guys, why are you guys standing around? Like, come on. Like, let's do this. That's what we want. What we don't want either is people look at this thing and like, ah. Ah, we hate when we have to do this. And like, This is so dumb. Like, there's no way we could. No sane person can get no no sane team of three can get it done in five hours. We're just going to throw in the towel and give up, yeah? Like, it can backfire very easily if they, if they lose heart,

Speaker 2  30:17
right? Well, that's what I think about. The where we're starting is the fact that everybody still gets their hourly everybody still gets their overtime pay. At the end of the day. You get what you always got, right? But here's an opportunity to get more, make more, take home more, and we spend a lot of time to create this opportunity for you guys. If some guys want to spit at it, um, that's not going to change that. I mean, technically, they're still going to get their pay. They can say That's stupid, whatever. I don't care. I'm just going to do my thing. They're going to get the same pay if there's going to be if, if half the guys are saying, I like this. This suits me, where, in their mind, they're saying it, and they engage on a better level. They're going to do more work. They're going to get the benefit of it, but the other guys are also going to get the benefit of it. So then I have to think, okay, so if half the guys do harder work in order to and it takes the team over the threshold and everybody gets rewarded, some guys on the other side are going to gravitate towards the idea and they're going to, you know, some guys, there's leaders out there. At the end of the day, me and my mom, if I want to be fair, I'm also going to have a measurable. I'm going to use these measurables that we're, we're creating, to look at overall contribution for each person for the entire year. And when I'm going to see the ones that were higher and better, and they're going to get an end of year bonus that's going to be skilled, and then the guys that were like, whatever, and like, some of those guys are just not going to get that extra bonus at the end of the year. So now the question is, do they need to know that? Well, some aspects, yes, they need to know that. So I've been telling guys, hey, I've been saying end of year the last two years, at the end of the year, everybody gets, everybody's always gotten a bonus, but it's based on years of service. So for every year they work here, they get another $50 at the end of the year. So some guys are up to $1,000 or more. Some guys are at, you know, 100 or two, or whatever. So the last two years, we've given an extra bonus, a a performance bonus, if you will. It's, there's no metric with it other than us looking at the guys having discussions internally with my supervisors and just being like, Okay, here's a kind of, kind of set a pool money aside and divide it out among those individuals. And some got 1000 some got 100 some got 500 some got one guy got a couple 1000. Like I'm telling the guys at the end of the year, if you go above and beyond, this is what I'm verbalized. This is what I verbalized at this point, Matt, at the end of the year, if you go above and beyond, you're going to get an additional bonus.

Unknown Speaker  33:49
So

Speaker 2  33:53
now I've become back and we say, Here's incentive program, here's how it works. When you guys produce more in the same amount of time, or more in less time, or the same amount in less time, it's going to show up on your pay. It's going to show up in everybody's pay as a percentage of your your current pay. So maybe 1% it may be 2% and maybe three, I don't know what you guys can do. And then when guys have the the guys that get it and the guys that want it, and the guys are going to contribute to it, they're like, Yeah, I'm working harder. But those guys are, they're not, hey, my only reassurance at that, you know, I was just saying, here's the deal. Don't forget, end of year, for guys that go above and beyond, they're going to get an additional bonus. So if you want to be that guy that leads and you're saying you're doing more than Don't worry. You're going to get an extra bonus at the end of the year to make so I don't. I can't be fair, fair, but it's, it's running, yeah, what do you think?

Matthias Miller  35:07
Well, there's also ways to spread the bonus. Yeah, I don't know. You can do, you can do skill set. You can do wage the but you can also do based on production value. So right? The more you produce. So okay, let's

Unknown Speaker  35:24
can we do? If I wanted to do a report, I would go back.

Matthias Miller  35:32
You can click the title to or, yeah, you can go back. All

Speaker 2  35:35
customers, all items. I would say you

Matthias Miller  35:39
do this date, but you could group by or Anyway, keep

Unknown Speaker  35:43
going. Yeah, I would say 112, what's today? 2121 was yesterday. I would say primary grouping is,

Matthias Miller  36:00
could just do employee and leave the secondary blank

Unknown Speaker  36:04
employee.

Unknown Speaker  36:12
That's a lot of numbers. We have to filter it down more.

Unknown Speaker  36:18
Wait, no, it's not

Unknown Speaker  36:21
okay. And then we go like this,

Matthias Miller  36:30
that's how much they produced. Were we on the right track here? But then you can also do you can also sort by, yeah. So if we're given pay period, you could say we're going to distribute the bonus,

Unknown Speaker  36:46
right, based on which

Matthias Miller  36:47
what you produced, which means that the you know, so if you want to beat if you want a bigger piece of the pie, just that has the advantage of, like, everybody gets A bonus, but you'll get more if you produce more, more of the suit,

Speaker 2  37:05
right, right, right. Currently, currently, if I Yeah, so currently, Matt, it's like everybody gets their current everybody gets the same hourly wage, and they're paid for each hour that they work, and they're also credited over time for overtime hours. So clean base now, the guys that are the top performers should be getting paid more, and so if you want extra work done, you're going to hopefully ask your top performers to do the extra work. If that's happening, well, let's if everybody works 40 hours, and your higher paid guys are going to get more than the bonus that we're distributing gets distributed based on each employee's contribution. So a guy that gets paid more hourly is going to get a little bit bigger piece of the pie. But it's not, it's still not Yeah, yeah, something, but it's not everything, yep. Um, I'm a little hesitant at this point to dive right in and do individual for every pay period, but it's not a bad conversation, and I'm I'm also not saying that we shouldn't. Maybe we should. Maybe we should start off with that right away. So what? Okay, so if I look at this report, this is for the year, it'd be much easier as a management tool, at least, for this year, to look at, to just head this direction at the end of the year. I look at this number right here, and I look, you know, and,

Matthias Miller  39:09
well, the dollar per hour is also a really interesting number. Yeah, well, that accounts for your well, no, the dollar produced is, is a factor of our right? Never mind,

Speaker 2  39:22
yep. Well, here's what's here's what's a little crazy. Um, this guy right here, like, do you see my screen? Dan King, he's only working. It works about two days a week. Simon's a little bit ahead of him. Simon's here every day. Young here every day. Julio is here. Steve's here every day.

Matthias Miller  39:47
Look at the dollar per hour. He's double all those guys. Dan,

Speaker 2  39:53
well, he's, oh yeah, that's because he and that's what I'm guess. So Mickey, Levi, am day. Miles, Dan King. These guys are, well, Mickey Levi and Dave. They're here almost every day on the nil machine. Mickey Levi here every day. Dave's off on Fridays. Dan's here about two days a week. And then the next guy, Jerry runs it every once in a while, and etter was helping there, he quit way back. Tyler was helping there, he quit way back. Like, if I would highlight, yeah, it's so it's not an accurate, you know, like, where my guys at Hiro's full time hand work. And he's at 155 there's Hiro. Michael quit Austin's. He wasn't handwork all year, but he Benjamin's been handwork all year. He works with Hiro. So those two guys are at the bottom, Osmond, handwork full time. 172, Steve's at 220, full time. Julio is 229, full time. Yanis full time. Simon's full time, the hand wash. It's crazy. It's they're producing more value on the machine. It doesn't mean they're producing more profit, but it's not. It's not an accurate like I have to break it down farther.

Matthias Miller  41:42
Well, we could break these down. I don't know how accurate the assembly method is, but we could do a breakdown by we could add a grouping by assembly method,

Unknown Speaker  41:52
right?

Matthias Miller  41:55
But, but even on the handwork, how do you explain the there are a few that are almost 3x two, two to 3x like, like, maybe not 2x at least 50% more.

Unknown Speaker  42:09
Well, should we go to the score calculator?

Unknown Speaker  42:14
Yeah, we could. Yeah, you need

Speaker 2  42:15
to talk to you about that. Okay, so let's go to, first off, actually, I'd like to go to Configure fasteners. The sort order does not affect the score, right? That is correct. I'm not sure why. Why did we do this sort order so

Matthias Miller  42:36
that it would be I um,

Speaker 2  42:43
but there's a score on the left, the one, the two, then the zero. I don't remember what we did there.

Matthias Miller  42:50
We just had said machines one and hand is two. And then we had talked about using cost as a

Speaker 2  43:01
cost times quantity is, what is that? Is that? Okay? I'll go to score calculator here, cost, cost times quantity, right here.

Unknown Speaker  43:21
Well,

Speaker 2  43:22
an item here. So AC, one, what's this? 11, 400 dash, 1504,

Unknown Speaker  43:36
can I get? Oh, here we go.

Matthias Miller  43:40
Okay, yeah, it is. The way we calculate score is the board feet times the weight, cost of all the fact fasters, type, faster weight, the the number of parts, times

Unknown Speaker  43:55
the parts weight,

Speaker 2  43:59
number of parts. It is calculating the number of fasteners times the cost. And that's the 504, so that's okay. So if I go back,

Speaker 2  44:16
11, 400 dash one, this is the total cost of the fasteners, and there's the weight. If I go back to the

Unknown Speaker  44:28
well,

Matthias Miller  44:30
you can see the item on the right, if it helps.

Speaker 2  44:33
Oh, I'm not on my windows too. Here. Can I move it? Yeah, I can't.

Unknown Speaker  44:37
Perfect.

Unknown Speaker  44:39
Wait, where's the

Matthias Miller  44:42
sorry, no, in the like on the right side of where you're dragging is you can, you

Speaker 2  44:46
can preview the Oh, yeah. What the one that I'm highlighting, gotcha, one that you're highlighting? Yes, yes. Um, okay, so I. Uh, the score versus price percentage on a on a machine is higher on a machine palette like this, HF is, that's a machine pallets, 37% uh, let me go down here, like here's the popular one

Unknown Speaker  45:23
is arm

Speaker 2  45:25
strong. This guy here is popular. 4646 37% that follow for a those guys make these most of the time, or a lot of the time. AR, 415, 50, that's a machine that's 37% AR, 412, 4620 4s machine that's a 40. That's a 46% score. Um, like these specials are all that's all like hand work, and those are down in like, the 20s. Uh, and

Unknown Speaker  46:06
I'm trying to,

Speaker 2  46:08
well, okay, let me go here. Let's go to like New Holland now, for example, because that's all hand work. So NH, forget some of the numbers, but a lot of these are, you know, 1415, 38, 6563797, that's ends. Where's a monster here? Let me, I can't What's been the problem here? 8870,

Unknown Speaker  46:48
35, and a half.

Speaker 2  46:52
Wow, I'm not finding center blocks anyway, these numbers are all below 30, right? It's all hand work. So, um, the score versus the price, if the pricing is right, should be the same. So my scoring, I think, I think what I need to do is, well, I know the fastener weight,

Unknown Speaker  47:17
um,

Unknown Speaker  47:19
probably needs to come up, because,

Matthias Miller  47:24
right? So, yep, sorry, go ahead, you're bringing it up will, will should theoretically reduce the difference between machine and hand fasteners and and it's such a small number already, like, right?

Speaker 2  47:38
So fastener weight is a big part of it. And then if I go back to that a, let's just go back to a, well, what's our average score versus price? Do we know that?

Matthias Miller  47:51
Yeah, all the way down to the bottom average.

Speaker 2  47:54
So let's go to AR, 001, and get to zero average, right? Sure, that makes sense. I think so. So if I go to AR, 001, my average is 11. If I come back, if I want to get this 37 back to average, let's adjust. I'd say this would be I

Speaker 2  48:23
wait, what's the biggest contribute? Cost of fasteners is really low. Here parts is two board feet is

Matthias Miller  48:35
right? But if you give more weight to the cost of fasteners, then it'll reduce the expensive, fast. I mean, it'll it'll increase the score of next.

Speaker 2  48:48
So let's go 40. Hang on.

Unknown Speaker  48:52
Hang on. What am I here?

Unknown Speaker  48:58
And if I go parts,

Unknown Speaker  49:06
am I doing this easy way? Matt, I might not be.

Matthias Miller  49:09
I have an idea here for

Unknown Speaker  49:14
do I need to save that? Or will it?

Matthias Miller  49:16
You need to click off some Yeah, hit save changes in the top right, and then I'll recalculate it. No, not there, right here. Yeah, that guy, yep.

Speaker 2  49:31
All those numbers changed a lot. Look at that. AR, 001, now we're at,

Unknown Speaker  49:40
wait still 11.

Unknown Speaker  49:46
Now I'm at 41

Unknown Speaker  49:56
maybe parts, and if

Speaker 1  49:59
I do, I. Up average. I

Unknown Speaker  50:19
mean the numbers are higher,

Unknown Speaker  50:27
AR, 412, if you're doing something else, don't sorry. I don't

Matthias Miller  50:34
want to. I'm working on this. I'm attacking this same problem from a different angle. So yeah,

Unknown Speaker  50:39
yep, I thought you were alright. Um,

Speaker 2  51:51
Matt, can I interrupt you? Yep, go for it. I think we're going to have to put a calculator in there for machine versus hand. Okay,

Matthias Miller  52:08
which is basically, we have two faster scores. One's a cost, a faster cost weight, and

Speaker 2  52:19
we would add another, another weight, unless I haven't ran a bunch of different ones here, but I increased the board feet weight. What are you finding?

Matthias Miller  52:33
I am this is, this is the edge of my knowledge set. But what I'm trying to do is run a few scenarios.

Matthias Miller  52:52
Let's see, what if we would

Matthias Miller  53:01
okay? There's two ways to go about it. One, we could do some trial and error on weights. The other option that we could do as well is, it seems to me like,

Matthias Miller  53:14
Okay, your pricing model, you're saying material cost is a fixed percentage of price, in most cases, right, right. Overhead and profit is a fixed percentage of price, right? And so the remainder, then, is the

Unknown Speaker  53:38
is the and, and

Matthias Miller  53:43
and the remainder, then, is labor,

Unknown Speaker  53:49
right?

Matthias Miller  53:51
So labor is the true variable cost for these items, right?

Unknown Speaker  53:58
Right.

Matthias Miller  54:01
So then the real question becomes, so then, by very definition, what we are saying,

Matthias Miller  54:17
I mean, but if that's true, then the dollar output per hour, then why are the production reports showing Below dollar an hour output for hand versus machine?

Unknown Speaker  54:39
That's that's

Speaker 4  54:53
be, I mean, I'm, I.

Speaker 2  55:00
The first thing that comes to my mind is that we're not. We're not

Unknown Speaker  55:18
We're not

Speaker 2  55:22
valid. Valuing the contribution of labor to hand work like we are to machine like as high as we are to machine work.

Matthias Miller  55:37
Are we okay? Okay, but we just got done saying,

Matthias Miller  55:50
No, this can't be true. If the pricing, what I described as the pricing model, can't be how you price items, then I mean, that doesn't even

Speaker 2  56:01
make Well, hey, would it be okay to bring Rick into this conversation?

Matthias Miller  56:06
Yes, I would. I think yes, it would be. I would love to hear an in depth explanation about how you come up with prices for each item, because I think, I think that would be useful for this.

Speaker 2  56:17
Yeah, I agree. So let me get me. Let me grab him here if I can. Yeah, I want I had him here earlier. Um, my dad interrupted him with some Florida electric bill stuff. In the middle of all, I'm like, um, yeah, not sure, interference, man, running interference. It's the enemy running interference, and he uses people whenever he can, whoever he

Unknown Speaker  56:46
that's about true. Sorry, that's not kind,

Speaker 2  56:48
but, well, I don't mean it to be dishonoring, either.

Unknown Speaker  56:54
I understand two

Unknown Speaker  56:57
Well, man, help me. Jesus. Alright. I

Speaker 2  1:00:03
Alright, Matt, um, you good? Yep, I'm good. So I'm gonna take my laptop over to Rick's desk, and we're gonna go with from there. Um,

Matthias Miller  1:00:19
I'm gonna take a quick couple minute break while

Unknown Speaker  1:00:21
you You're good, man, perfect.

Speaker 2  1:01:38
I have all the items in Yellow except the 16 foot LDL and

Unknown Speaker  1:02:05
all you after,

Unknown Speaker  1:02:10
all right, Matt, Sorry, I'm getting there.

Speaker 4  1:02:20
All good, all good buddy, we're getting there. Sounds like a

Matthias Miller  1:02:24
plan,

Unknown Speaker  1:02:26
alright? So,

Speaker 2  1:02:33
yeah, I had a feeling, Rick, I'm gonna need you, or this necessary to get you how do you Amanda, I have to Well, should I come over there? Yes, all right.

Unknown Speaker  1:02:54
Hey,

Speaker 5  1:02:58
Matthias, Hey, Rick, how you doing? I'm doing good. How are you I'm fine. Thanks.

Speaker 2  1:03:05
Hey, we're it's so I'm Matt up. I think I better catch Rick up. Just a little bit here. Yep. So Rick, if we look at here's

Unknown Speaker  1:03:17
the report,

Speaker 2  1:03:21
there's the fasteners. We were looking at this earlier. Matt, and then I couldn't, I couldn't pull up the reports. Um, but here we're looking at all right. Rick, so here's the employee and dollar value, dollar produced contribution. Mickey, Levi, am you know, top two guys are here every day, 504. Dave, miles, he's 439, versus six. I mean, he's in here four days, right? And Simon's top hand, 279, big Dan's right there. You know, I'm saying so we're so, let me go back even farther. So we're, we're talking about incentive for the guys, right? And we're having an open mind as far as, like, if we're gonna, if we're going to reward everybody on the team. But there's guys out there that don't care, aren't motivated. They're going to go the same speed they always did, but half the guys are going to work harder because they like the idea. So they're going to generate a boat, an incentive for everybody, and they're going to and they might come and say, Hey, man, I've been working harder, but that guy doesn't work any harder than ever did before. Why do I have to work with this guy? It's not perfectly fair, because we're spreading it out. So I told Matt, like we the last two years, you know, we've always done the the bonus. We've always done. Bonus annually for based on years of years of service here.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:06
But two years you started

Speaker 2  1:05:08
the last two years, yeah, I started doing a one for, like, hey guys that go above and beyond. And we had a pool, and we gave, like, one guy got a couple 1000. Some guys got maybe 1500 100 whatever it wasn't, and we're and using that as a as a rewarder for those individuals, not necessary, not diving in and trying to figure out a perfect bonus system for every pay period, for every person individually, because that feels a little heavy right now, trying to get to that point. But as a as a good way to do that end of year bonus to to reward guys individually, right? We can look at this, sure, but when I look at this page right here in front of me, if I'm going to reward guys according to this, it's certainly not fair at all. Guys and machine are getting or being a being what is the word allotted, attributed for way more contribution than guys on handwork. Mm, hmm. Matt, do you want to jump in or what?

Matthias Miller  1:06:25
Yeah, I think basically what we're after, what we're trying to do with this, the scoring model was basically find, well, really what we're trying to trying to measure is the amount of effort required to produce something which so then it's a matter of, well, let's, let's extract, however, out of the pricing model for an item, how do we extract just the labor portion? Because theoretically that is, or that should be the level of effort required to do it, whether it's it's nailer or hand, and so my mind, it would be useful to to have you walk through what the pricing model is on items and how those get calculated, and then explore, is there a way that we can extrapolate, you know, or, I mean, are there things we need to sink from Sage, or there, are there ways that we could extrapolate, a an effort, number of some kind, which, which is basically just, what's the labor, what's, what is the calculated labor cost for this on a per item basis, or we could even conceivably, if you have a pricing spreadsheet, we could conceivably just do any that that's tied out to a sage at it. We could conceivably just import that and use that as the basis for that's where my headspace is at. I don't know if that's too many wild and loose ends.

Speaker 5  1:08:03
No, I hear where you're going. Yeah, I do it on spreadsheet, my pricing and what there are certain things that go into it to come up with the pricing, like board feet. So, you know, in hand work, usually it's a lot more board feet than machine work. So I figure out what the board feed is, and then what I do is I take cost of lumber. Now, it varies where we're getting it right now. I adjust that. I take the board footage times 58, cents per board foot, which is more than what we're paying, but I want to put a little cushion in there. Then I multiply that by 10% because we figure, okay, there's going to be 10% waste at least my next item, then is the quantity. Now you got to set up costs. So the more you have that you're building that setup cost is going to be spread out more if you're only making three of them, then that setup cost is going to be a lot more expensive, right? That's where the quantity comes into play. Then I take the fasteners. So again, usually ham work. You. Got more fasteners involved. I multiply that by right now. It's, it's, I try to use one cent per nail on it's, it's more expensive on hand work than in his machine. And the reason being, it's a different type of nail. So we sell ham work, I get a little bit more money on each nail than I do machine work. You follow me? Yeah,

Speaker 2  1:10:36
that's if an item is built, if the same item is built on a machine. The nails cost a little less than if you build that item by hand, which, right now, everything that we have Rick is either allotted as a hand bill or machine bill. No, good. Yeah.

Speaker 5  1:10:54
So then I get the price the nails. So in this case, what I'm looking at, there's 126 fasteners. I'm getting a penny per nail, $1.26 so then I go over, I have setup costs for the machines. It's a little bit more. It's $21 per setup on the machines hand work. It's 1450 and I should probably go back and and average that out again here. But for the most part, what we did was take what the average price is with the guys for that setup. So for the 504 a what I do is I take the quantity divided by the setup costs, so that's one, then I run through and we took how long it usually takes to build something on a machine. The 504 a at the time was faster than a 504 B, so adding basically 25 cents to each one of those in the labor category. On a, 504, B,

Speaker 5  1:12:31
I'm taking 28 cents because it took longer to for a pallet to go through, and then for hand I'm taking 80 cents because, of course, it takes longer, but I'm also adding a half a cent for each nail that is put in there

Speaker 2  1:12:59
on handwork Hand board. That's your setup cost. What

Speaker 5  1:13:02
you that's setup costs and what they're producing,

Unknown Speaker  1:13:06
that's the labor

Speaker 5  1:13:07
cost. Yep, yep. So of course, you got delivery costs now overhead is four times what the amount of the labor that goes in each pallet. That's where I come up with the overhead. Basically, what I do is, what of our what are our other expenses? Now I take out, you know, the direct labor with that. I take out the delivery cost. It's just based on that pallet and how much it takes to build that pallet for that team. So you, I mean, in this case, it's ham work. I'm coming up with a buck 58 but my overhead is $6.30 because it needs to cover everything else. Then, then I take the total cost of those categories, in this case, I add 10% and that's where I'm coming up with pricing.

Matthias Miller  1:14:14
So it seems to me, I don't know if I'm fully here, but it seems to me like part of the issue is that, no we are accounting for

Speaker 2  1:14:31
I think I'm thinking that The reality is, machines are much it's much more expensive to run a nail machine than to run a nail gun. Yeah. Okay,

Speaker 5  1:14:55
Hi, John. What?

Unknown Speaker  1:15:05
Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:15:20
okay,

Speaker 5  1:15:23
okay, I'll look for it also on, on on the electric bill. They would not let me set it up like that. They're going to send you an application so and it needs your bank information because they're saying that credit cards expire and well, in my What if you close the bank account? Well, that typically doesn't happen.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:56
Okay, yeah, I finally got through with somebody. It wasn't easy, yeah, but they're going to send you an application fill out.

Unknown Speaker  1:16:14
Did they have an application? Oh, you're kidding me.

Speaker 5  1:16:23
Yeah, yeah, that's what they told me, all right, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:16:40
heck yeah.

Speaker 5  1:16:46
Now it's easier to ask for forgiveness and it's for permission. Yep, yep, bye, bye,

Unknown Speaker  1:17:01
nope. So, so

Speaker 2  1:17:05
the reality is, machines aren't costly to run. I mean, much. They're very costly to purchase, and then the run is more costly than running a nail gun. So machines should generate more value.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:20
Um,

Speaker 2  1:17:23
like, if we put everything else aside, the the value produced on a machine per labor hour is going should be higher than if you produce it by hand, right?

Speaker 5  1:17:41
Yes, but you're putting out so much more on a machine, right? You you have less labor in that right, sell it that we're putting through. So if we

Speaker 2  1:17:57
just for simplicity, if we would take Rick your like the labor that you attribute per dollar on a per on a machine, versus the labor number that you're attributing on a hand on a handwork. What's the difference? What percentage is

Speaker 5  1:18:19
that? Well, if you look at this, okay, right. To make this, if you were to make this pallet on 504, A, it's 46 cents each. If you're to make it on on B, it's 49 cents, right hand is a buck 58 right? So you can see the difference right of how much more it is hand right than it is. Do

Speaker 2  1:18:47
you have a spreadsheet like that for like Armstrong Marietta, yeah. Can we see the number diff the difference of your sorry, yeah, Matt, and

Matthias Miller  1:18:58
where I'm going with this. I mean, I guess this is the rabbit trail heading down. It sounds to me like potentially we need a I don't know this fully gets us. It certainly gets us closer to the zone, a weighting factor by assembly method.

Speaker 2  1:19:13
Right, right, right, right. Hand, hand. Hand has a weight versus a set versus machine.

Matthias Miller  1:19:20
Yeah, but maybe even more specifically, down to which machine,

Unknown Speaker  1:19:26
yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 5  1:19:29
I mean, there are certain you can't make a four stringer pallet on the B machine, but you can the a machine right now, I'll be honest with you, if, if, if I'm not sure which machine it's going to go on, if it's a three Stringer, I always go with B, because we get a little bit more yep,

Speaker 2  1:19:53
yep. Because we can make a three stringer on either machine. We can only do four on the A, which is. Uh, which a four stringer is going to be more costly. There's more value there than a three stringer.

Speaker 5  1:20:10
But the there's usually more board footage

Unknown Speaker  1:20:14
initially, right? There's more about, yeah,

Speaker 5  1:20:18
so you're, you're capturing more that cost in there where

Speaker 2  1:20:22
it's easier to generate more value, like we can generate more value with the same amount of effort and setup and all that, right? But we're trying, like you said, Matt, we're trying to capture the labor value for everything

Matthias Miller  1:20:47
now is the setup, the quantities that you use for the setup cost is that you know average order quantity across a year. Is it? What?

Speaker 5  1:20:58
When I set this up, I had conversations with both George and T and then we went out and basically saw how much time it was. So on 504 a, you got three people, but it was still quicker than a, 504 B setup. Now, since we have a new B this setups a lot sooner, but I didn't adjust for that. I just kept that and I'm making and they're both 21 $21 for setup on average. Now, with hamward, they just build a jig. They don't have to adjust machine. They don't have to do anything. They build a jig. And there's two people there, and we took the average amount of time, and this is coming from George and John T and I took the average wage out there, and that's what I went with with the setup cost on that.

Speaker 2  1:22:04
But that's little. That's crazy though, because I'm on, I could be off, but I'm attributing more setup time to hand work than I am to machine work.

Speaker 5  1:22:20
But you on some of them, we already have a jig. All they gotta do is pull it out.

Speaker 2  1:22:25
Yeah, but there's more to like. There's

Speaker 5  1:22:30
some of them, yeah, I'm I'm just going by,

Speaker 2  1:22:34
I hear you. No, I do, I do it. But I would disagree with that. What they're telling you to some degree, because

Speaker 5  1:22:45
now, if it's a brand new palette, it's going to be different.

Speaker 2  1:22:48
Because these guys, like, you know, they have to go, I don't know,

Unknown Speaker  1:22:55
Wow, that's crazy.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:57
I mean, if we have a jig, it takes him how long ago get the jig and put it on. Yeah, you see what I'm saying.

Speaker 2  1:23:07
I know. I know. I know. No, you're right, but they have, man, it's I don't know. I just know it takes longer to set up.

Unknown Speaker  1:23:19
It might now

Unknown Speaker  1:23:22
hand, like sometimes some of the, some of those jobs,

Speaker 5  1:23:25
it's like some of them do some of them, you just got to come up with an average, no, I, right, right, right, right now with, with the 504 B, honestly, it's, it's a lot less time and setting it up even in 504

Speaker 2  1:23:39
a, right? So your hand set up, if it's 14, what would that is that $7 what is that based on?

Speaker 5  1:23:48
That's based on the amount of time and a wages paid,

Unknown Speaker  1:23:54
and how much time is that allotting for setup?

Speaker 5  1:23:58
Ah, boy, I I have to go back. And I just knew that figure,

Speaker 2  1:24:02
is it 15 minutes or something like they're talking

Speaker 5  1:24:15
might have been 20 minutes, okay, I mean, I broke it down for a minute, and what's the average it takes for setup, yeah, and then that's spread out over the quantity of items,

Unknown Speaker  1:24:29
right, right.

Speaker 5  1:24:33
So if they're only making five, that figure still is divided by five, right, and make it 100 it's set up over 100 I mean, you'll see, if I change this to 50, and you look at the hammer, there's 158 I've set this to 50. Goes to 172 Yeah. See. And I mean, it's all tied into that,

Unknown Speaker  1:25:02
yeah, yeah,

Speaker 5  1:25:06
yeah. One thing I do that, when Tina comes to me, one thing I do is she uses Dolores old setup, like for heat treating. I get a profit on that too, even though we already got a profit built into it. That total cost goes across, lumber, nails, hand delivery, overhead, heat, treaty, and then that figure is 10. I had 10% profit on there, and that's where I'm coming up with that price.

Unknown Speaker  1:25:51
So

Speaker 2  1:25:55
Matt, is it like what? What do you guys think? Like is the question? Is the question, what do we need to use as a calculator for machine versus hand? Is that the question we need to answer?

Matthias Miller  1:26:13
Well, I think to me, okay, like I mean, heat treating is another variable, and we're not going to get it perfect. But to me, perfect. But to me, I don't know how much variation is there between between machines,

Speaker 2  1:26:32
between the 504 A and B. There's not

Speaker 5  1:26:38
well. You got to consider this. How many on a typical job, you got two guys working the the B machine, right?

Speaker 2  1:26:48
Yeah, they do three. So about half the time, though,

Speaker 5  1:26:51
okay, one, A, there's always three guys, right? So you got much more labor on there, right? Wages, I should say, than you do the B, but it takes them longer to produce on B than it does a. Yeah, I mean that. I mean your number. I mean

Speaker 2  1:27:14
some of that is the guys,

Unknown Speaker  1:27:17
I agree that work

Speaker 2  1:27:19
there. Um, they both machines got upgraded in the last well, one was in 21 the other one was last year 24 and they both had the same upgrade. And so the primary difference at this point is that one can do four stringers. The other one's a set up for three or less. Like the setup times should be the same. Like from most everything else is comparable.

Speaker 2  1:27:58
Like they should both be. They both machines. If you ran the same, say you ran a three stringer pallet on one versus the other, would one out do the other one probably shouldn't like they probably should be very close. If they both ran the same palette, so they both had three guys, it would probably be, you know, I don't know. So I don't know if we, I guess, I'm not sure that we need to be machine specific. Now, if we start using like the woodpecker or the champion, if we throw that in a whole different that's a little bit that that probably needs to be considered. But 504, A versus B.

Speaker 4  1:28:44
I don't know that I'm too concerned

Unknown Speaker  1:28:49
about. I just the the the the cost on that you're talking pennies in terms of labor, yeah, I mean three or four cents.

Matthias Miller  1:29:07
So if you break down, I have a report here. We got a bunch of stuff with a blank assembly method, which we got to chase. But I'm looking down here like Vikings that the A produces. This is since July 1 off of a backup actually, hang on, let me, let me, let me not give me one second, or give me not a second. Let me give me about a minute. Let's run this in the live system, and let's, let's get something. Let's get real numbers.

Speaker 2  1:29:35
Well, if we Yeah, if we do a machine report, we'd

Matthias Miller  1:29:40
be give me one second, and you can run a machine report.

Speaker 4  1:29:43
Okay, a would blow be away what we're doing. But

Matthias Miller  1:29:49
if, if, all right, get now just, just hit the assembly Analysis Report from the menu again, yep. Or like, start over, like, go to the home screen and click it. You. Okay, yep, and now put in your stuff, and then in the grouping, put in the machine

Unknown Speaker  1:30:12
we're going with January. Is that right?

Matthias Miller  1:30:17
Yeah, yeah, we can do January till today,

Speaker 2  1:30:22
20 Hey, all, assuming we got, what do we say? Cust

Matthias Miller  1:30:25
all primary grouping. Just change primary grouping to assembly method. Yep, that's it.

Speaker 2  1:30:42
And then, if I go, if I do it at dollars per

Unknown Speaker  1:30:50
hour, this guy here,

Speaker 2  1:30:54
dollars per hour, a, 626, b5, 35 I,

Unknown Speaker  1:31:05
champion,

Speaker 5  1:31:11
what's that represent? Dollars slash at

Speaker 2  1:31:17
that's representing the per we know the hours worked on the machine, and we know the dollars produced on a machine. So that's for every man hour we're producing 626, on the a gotcha. Now, John's stuff isn't everything's not cleaned up. I'm not sure what this includes. Matt, is this just June, July and August, or whatever?

Matthias Miller  1:31:44
Well, it's got some historical stuff, but historical stuff is a lot. I would trust John's stuff even more than even despite what we need to clean up. I would trust that probably more than even before that. But

Speaker 2  1:31:58
all right, well, I could do the I could go back then and do um, I can change this just for let's see what that does. 623, or something. Yeah, I think if I go right six, I think if I go 26 I'm good. I think

Unknown Speaker  1:32:19
626, 536, 530s,

Unknown Speaker  1:32:25
what did I do then?

Unknown Speaker  1:32:38
Six?

Unknown Speaker  1:32:43
They are much closer, yeah?

Speaker 5  1:32:48
And it's because it's cleaner, yeah? Well, I just want to say I think it's much closer because you got three people working on the A and you don't have three people all the time, we're

Speaker 2  1:33:03
going to be Oh, he does a lot more now than he used to since he moved Big Dan off to Oh, okay, hey, when he's here, he'll put him back there, gotcha, which is two days, two days a week,

Matthias Miller  1:33:16
but, but we still need to account for this, because, I mean, well, I don't know How much you care, but you're still looking at a 50% difference between woodpecker and, I mean, the A is still 50% more than the woodpecker. So if you just do it based off of machine versus hand, I don't know, still seems like it's a substantial amount of variability, but,

Speaker 2  1:33:38
well, there is. But actually, let me go back to this conversation about three guys or two guys. When there's three guys, the value is spread out of for three guys. When there's two guys, spread out for two guys. So when they're running with two on the B, that's where we go back to our you know, 1000 pallets. If the A can do 1500 a day, they should be able to do 1000 we were trying to get those, you know what? I mean, yep, the same amount per guy should still be possible, because you're only on a three stringer anyway. So the value per hour should be really close, um, but then woodpecker and hand station. I mean, woodpecker, we're looking at 32 hours, not a real good sample size, but I'd say it's about right. I mean, if I, if I go by cost of the machine, I'd say we're about right, dollars per hour. You know, value of the machine that we're that we're using, probably about right. More expensive machine can produce more per hour anyway. So how do we

Matthias Miller  1:34:50
well? So there's few ways to there's Okay. Here's my proposal for next steps. Proposal number one, let's add a waiting method by assembly. Awaiting. In value based on assembly method, right? Step number two, then is, how do we come up with good weights? Well, there's, there's two ways to do it. I think, I think in a couple hours, we could run, or maybe even less, in an hour, maybe we could, we could run. We just do some brute force waiting like just do point one increments across the first two weights or first three weights, let the fourth one auto calculate out to one, and just run and see which which scoring model generates the least variance as a score versus price percentage point

Unknown Speaker  1:35:38
comfortable with that riff.

Unknown Speaker  1:35:42
Run that by me one more time.

Matthias Miller  1:35:44
Okay, so we just take, we basically take, we take our item list and we, we, we, we just our three different our board feet weights,

Speaker 2  1:35:56
go to the score page and do that. That would, that

Matthias Miller  1:35:59
would that would be way helper, way easier to explain it.

Speaker 2  1:36:02
Just to to help you see my screen. Matt Rick, So Rick, here's the items, right? And so we have the board fee up. Here's the board feet weight, like I think I was playing with these numbers earlier, out of a hole, is one, so 50% is weighted to this contribution, 20% to parts, 30%

Speaker 5  1:36:26
to fasteners. When you say parts, what's

Speaker 2  1:36:29
parts is, how many different sizes of lumber does it take to make that item? Gotcha. Gotcha. So because it complicates it, it's it's a weight. We don't have a weight up here for assembly method. We used to Matt. The reason we took it out, I think that was Stephen and I back. We took it out because I thought, I thought we could capture it with fastener weight, because fasteners are hand versus, versus machine, right, right? The difference is in there. But then then we said, Let's take out the method and just strictly go with the price. But that's not obviously, that's not enough because, because if we go then we have Rick the score, which is whatever the numbers generated. It's not correct, right? We're trying to get it. Price is here. This is accurate. Um, the score versus price score is based on these weights and base, like we know, the border feet and the parts of the cost of fastest are hard, fast numbers. The weights are not hard fast numbers, but we're trying to get it so a variance from average. That's this column, score versus price. So for example, if I go to like Armstrong Marietta, which is an easier one to wrap our heads around, square versus price right now, it's 49% if I go to like hand work, which is, well, Armstrong special, let's go Armstrong special, 46 by what do we got here? Here's a 46 by 46 we got a 46 by 44 score versus price is 26 so we know like, that's a that's hand one, that's

Speaker 5  1:38:33
yes, where do you account for, like, setup costs?

Unknown Speaker  1:38:46
That's that's not being

Speaker 5  1:38:50
what, what? What do you want? What is this telling you, if you look at this, what's that telling you

Speaker 2  1:38:59
that we're trying to quantify the labor contribution for each item, and then once we can measure labor contribution on each item, now we can attribute a value, or maybe an incentive or a bonus to the guy that's, you know, contributing that that effort,

Speaker 5  1:39:30
and then this, you got negatives, you got positives.

Speaker 2  1:39:36
That's the score which we current, which we're currently showing based on these weights in comparison to the actual price

Unknown Speaker  1:39:48
of the item. Okay, right?

Unknown Speaker  1:39:50
So if there's a if here's the score, it's 29% 5.74 is 29% Of the price 1940 but the average, the average score, is zero. This is below average. Like the score right now is below average, below average. I don't know what average score should be, I think it's what, 35 in this equation.

Matthias Miller  1:40:25
Yeah, 35% okay,

Speaker 2  1:40:28
that makes sense. Rick, so if we add Matt, so you're saying, we can play with this, add a weight for assembly method. Yeah, I didn't mean to go on a bunny trail with the fasteners, but that was, that was the thought was that if we know what the fastener value is, maybe that's enough of a difference. But it's not because, back to Marietta. Marietta armstro Marie a very the most popular one. We're 49% score is 49% of the price. If I go down to New Holland or like, say, and what's I'm out of touch a little bit. What's

Unknown Speaker  1:41:23
you know, 884746487546474,

Unknown Speaker  1:41:33
man, why am I not coming? This thing used to roll off my tongue. That's

Speaker 2  1:41:42
the N blocks center block. Anyway, this is handwork. These numbers are 34% 3232 41 like it's lower than Marietta. If I'm trying to find monsters, why can't I find any monsters? Right now, it's nuts. Um,

Unknown Speaker  1:42:06
um to the grief. Let me flick on these till I find one

Speaker 4  1:42:14
block and block that's lumber, rear leg,

Unknown Speaker  1:42:21
60 below 68

Speaker 4  1:42:25
he needed a column, one, it's One, one, it's just, you just need to get At

Speaker 5  1:42:53
Yeah, they're green palettes. They're all painted green.

Unknown Speaker  1:43:03
Yeah, I'll give him a call. There's Thank you. You're welcome.

Speaker 2  1:43:11
There's a monster Rick. That's the 134 by 48 that's 45%

Unknown Speaker  1:43:19
score versus price.

Unknown Speaker  1:43:36
Yeah, I'm not sure Matt, there's

Matthias Miller  1:43:38
if it seems to me, Well, okay, taking taking two giant steps back. Are we looking to us to align? Are we looking to align the labor with how many hours they work in the shop? Work fast? Are we getting them to work faster? To fundamentally, we're trying to get them to work faster, to so that we're work at a pace that they meet or exceed the labor cost on any given item, right? Yeah, yeah. So the most logical thing for me, I think, would be, or to me would be, I'm a little worried about, I think it's almost more like, can we take the So ultimately, what we need to do is to be able, given a price, to either know or extrapolate what is the labor? Ultimately, what, what percentage of that is labor for this item, as close as we can, I mean, and so there's a few ways we can do this. We can you. We take the pricing formula. And I mean, in some ways, the easiest way to do this, or, okay, well, I don't know if it's easier. There's a few ways we could do this. We could put the Price Calculator into here, so then the logic just is here, and we would always know what that labor value is. So That's option number one. Option number two is we could add assembly method, weights and and just run, run some, I think, just basic brute force. Just brute force. Run through every point one or point, oh, five, weight, right, right, and see, see what gets us the closest to but, but we still need to know the target. We still need to know for each item. So I think so. But then, sorry, no, go,

Speaker 2  1:46:02
if, if we're trying just to make everything a zero, like, if we want score and price to be the same, it, it doesn't really, it doesn't really accomplish anything, because we still, we already know that the guys on the machine are generating much more price power than the guys on hand.

Matthias Miller  1:46:28
So the next question would be, Rick, could you easily give us an Excel export or something along those lines that gives us the item code and the labor cost for that one.

Speaker 5  1:46:46
I mean, I I can send you, the way I have it set up is like I'm looking at Val products right now. It's got the part number. It's got board footage, it's got the lumber. I mean, I can send you this sheet so you can extrapolate what you need out of there.

Matthias Miller  1:47:13
I kind of think we have to do that. I don't think we can. I could be wrong. I mean, I'm, I'm, I'm fine, I'm fine doing that. Mer, do you have thoughts?

Speaker 2  1:47:33
Well, just I'm still, maybe I'm still stuck in this back here, but I'm not trying to be stuck. I'm just saying, like, if I go back to the report that we just looked at 626, to 821, and I looked At what was that Cust? What was primary grouping? It

Unknown Speaker  1:48:03
was assembly method.

Speaker 2  1:48:06
If I just look at that, and if I look at score per hour like I know what this is the average score per hour produced. Like, if that's accurate, or like, say, we look at it, and we have we clean up everything. John cleans up all his recent entries, and then we go back and excel, and we do all that clean up, and then we look at this, this report right here again, like, is that enough? Is that enough of a calculator based on those, that number right there to just throw that into the

Unknown Speaker  1:48:57
mix?

Matthias Miller  1:48:59
Like, could this? Could we lock, lock this in as the waiting method for labor, for labor? Well, either for labor,

Unknown Speaker  1:49:11
I don't What do you think?

Matthias Miller  1:49:17
At least the wait for the I mean it, it seems, it seems sane to me that you could have this as the variable for the assembly method weight. But again, we need to have, in my mind, we need to have an objective target that we're shooting for. The objective target is what is the calculated labor cost of this item,

Speaker 2  1:49:43
correct, but it above above that would be what should be the labor cost for the item?

Matthias Miller  1:49:59
Okay? So if we're going to go into the what should it be, then we have the problem of we don't trust I think that then becomes first and foremost before we even get to incentive. I feel like the bearer of really, really bad news. But if we don't trust the labor numbers on our item pricing, then we need to fix that first before we tell the guys what it what, what it should

Speaker 2  1:50:22
so, no, I'm not. I'm not. I'm not thinking of it that way. I'm thinking of it as like. I guess I'm thinking of it as like. Are the guys working slower on some things and faster on others, when at the end, like, when you know what I mean, like, just because some things we I don't know they're harder, because maybe we don't have quite the right tool for that job, or maybe it's just the way we set up on that job. I don't know. I'm getting into some pony trolls.

Matthias Miller  1:51:02
This is the issue. And I think I mean, you also don't know whether, whether, the if, if teams live on specific stations. You don't have any data by which you can tell whether it's a people problem or a machine problem. If you don't switch people around, you don't know,

Unknown Speaker  1:51:22
right, which we do that,

Matthias Miller  1:51:27
some of that, I mean, which we you could control a little bit with a sub report by individual, as I mean, like you can do secondary grouping by individual and look at how individuals perform on each each machine, potentially the part of the issue With the incentive program as well that you can do is you can have some form of a this is the terrible term. This is not the reward mentality, but like a dispute idea. Like you said, this should be done in two hours, but you're absolutely crazy and and so we look at it, we're like, oh, well, this is, first of all, it does two things. We two things. One, it could say, you're right, this is a lot more work. We've been under charging for this thing for the last seven years. Or you could say, oh, well, that's dumb. Like, let's, let's go buy you guys the the thingy majig. That's going to make this thing actually take two hours, like we should have done a year and a half ago, but we got busy and we forgot. We never got it for you, and so treat it more like a it's almost like getting the guys out the shop on the same page, like, here's the incentive. But this is not hard fast truth. So if you guys run into an issue, if you think it's it's wildly off. Like, let's chat, let's problem solve. Like, can we help you guys do it faster? Do we need to raise the price on it? Do we need to any number of things? Well,

Speaker 2  1:52:53
I think I should, we should go, let's go back to like, I'm going way back now. But if we go back to the beginning of like incentive made simple, it's taking historical labor as a percentage of sales. Historical say it's 11% and every time that they produce the every time that the sales, if the labor after two weeks is 11% of sales, everybody gets everything Same as usual, and they go home. If the labor is 12% of sales, everybody gets paid hours, overtime, everything else. Everybody goes home same pay as usual, more because it took them longer. If labor is 10% of sales it they got the same amount done in less time. We're going to pay them 11% right? So they got incentive pay. They got the same pay for doing it in less time. Like, that's what we're trying to do as a simple incentive program. And for that, all we need to know is, how many dollars did they produce? We already have that information. And then what in those in you know, in each pay period we have that. Now we're talking about, we're talking about a more specific, individualized report that shows each guy's contribution. Say for the year. How well did this guy do in a year's time? We could, we could, essentially, we could break it into two categories. And we could say, all the hand, all the hand work, and look at that objectively, you know, knowing that the guys on hand produce more value. And then we could say, hey, the guys on or sorry, the guys on machine produce more value. So when we look at their end of your contribution, we're going. Look at it with that through that lens. End of the year, we could say, here's all the hand station guys, and look at it through that lens and just simply do it that way. Okay, just to make a call. Okay, gotcha, alright, Matt, I'm going to Rick, do you have any other thoughts about that or not, right now, you need to call that guy now. Yeah, all right.

Matthias Miller  1:55:26
I think you're, I get where you're going. That makes that makes sense. I that makes sense to me

Speaker 2  1:55:37
for a second. He's got to make a phone call.

Unknown Speaker  1:55:41
Um, hey, my driver's

Unknown Speaker  1:55:44
wounds wet. So

Speaker 5  1:55:47
yeah, I got, I got a favorite ass though, one of those small um,

Speaker 2  1:55:54
I don't want to ignore what Rick has done already. Like you said, like is there value in that for this there? It's more specific one day, more specific contribution for each guy. Is there value in adding Rick's labor metrics to this equation. Well,

Matthias Miller  1:56:21
we have until the end of the year to figure that out. Okay, right? Yep. And so I do think a fruitful insight from this conversation. We don't, it's so but here's, here's the problem I run into labor percentage is not is 11% across everything, but it's not. But if you, if you split by machine, it's not, that's not the labor percentage anymore. Like labor percentage, your labor percentage is, is not the same for, yeah,

Speaker 5  1:56:57
for, I know, for hand versus machine. Yeah, if you could, it would help us out then.

Matthias Miller  1:57:03
And so really, you should have different goals. Okay,

Speaker 4  1:57:12
either. Good weekend. Thanks. No problem. I don't know

Speaker 2  1:57:19
well let for as a whole, it's 11%

Matthias Miller  1:57:23
as a whole, it's 11 and we're rewarding the whole

Speaker 2  1:57:28
so it doesn't it can remain. It can remain. The incentive can be remain tied out to 11% Yeah. But if we step away from that and we go to more individualized rewards or incentives or end of your bonus, right? Um,

Unknown Speaker  1:57:59
then we have to break it down further.

Unknown Speaker  1:58:03
Um,

Unknown Speaker  1:58:07
and I really wonder if Couldn't we just take,

Speaker 2  1:58:16
yeah, I mean, I can look at, I mean, we, like he said, the rest of your talk about it, we could look, at the end of the year, I could say, get a report that shows 504, a each guy That's worked on there, and dollars per hour produced, um,

Unknown Speaker  1:58:52
or on machine like, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:59:00
So if I do it, let's just do this yet. If I do

Speaker 2  1:59:10
that's assembly method. If I do primary grouping, is

Unknown Speaker  1:59:25
I can't do just hand, can I? No, I was

Matthias Miller  1:59:29
thinking about that when I was on here, that I should, I should add a an assembly method filter,

Unknown Speaker  1:59:34
right, right, right, right, right.

Unknown Speaker  1:59:41
Which, which.

Speaker 2  1:59:48
Well, Matt Ricks on off that call, here, do we?

Matthias Miller  1:59:57
Well, listen, I think, I think. So if we're thanks, if the

Unknown Speaker  2:00:02
incentive is a

Matthias Miller  2:00:05
group incentive, and we're targeting 11% across everything, then no, nothing more needs to be done. I think if we want to dial in the score score calculator, I do probably think that. I probably do think that moving pricing logic into here ends up being the simplest way to get more granular. How is each person doing, and to really get accurate scoring, because then we'll know this is the the little thing I'm not sure about is the setup cost, because that's so variable. Um, but

Speaker 5  2:00:47
now on those sheets, they fill out, they fill out how long it takes them to set up.

Speaker 2  2:00:53
No, because we are, we built in some time deduction to set up in the assembly Analysis Report, right? Matt, yeah, yeah. We're, we're deducting, Rick, like, I think it's, you know, like 10 or 15 minutes on machine, and, like 20 on hand, or something like that. Yeah. And, and now I'd need to consider your what you have, because yours is less on hand, more on you know what I mean.

Speaker 5  2:01:27
So, yeah, but see you, you might be more accurate with machines now, it doesn't take as long as set up. Yeah, you breathe on

Unknown Speaker  2:01:40
it. Yeah, right,

Unknown Speaker  2:01:44
right. Chose to keep that no high well,

Speaker 2  2:01:49
but again, Rick, your your your labor, your overall labor. I think, I do think there's value in tying your labor labor calculation to this metric as we go forward. And Matt, in order to do that, what was that? Was there a simple, couple simple line items that would give you, that would give us that, that Rick could send over at some point.

Matthias Miller  2:02:18
I mean, if, if he sends the Price Calculator over, we could, I think, I mean, we could, we could deduce it from that, I think, or see how close we can get to deducing it from that.

Speaker 5  2:02:29
I can just email them. She over,

Speaker 2  2:02:38
yeah, yeah. Is that? Does that seem

Speaker 4  2:02:44
Yeah? Does that seem Yeah? Very problem doing that. Okay.

Speaker 2  2:02:50
Um, while we're all three on the same in the same space here, um, Rick, you saw the report.

Unknown Speaker  2:03:02
Here. Let me put this up here. Good to stand up,

Speaker 2  2:03:09
right? This, like, if, if we were to go, like, get you a proper report, we know John's numbers are right. We know his and I would go in here. So then I will go in here, and I would do, oh, shoot, Matt. I need to ask you about Rick's past word to access silver loom the user but I've never been on it. He's never been on it, and I've I'm either blanking on how do I get does? Is there a password I need to give him?

Matthias Miller  2:03:38
You can go into Advanced User Group, administration, right hand side there, yep, you can go, click on his name down at the bottom.

Unknown Speaker  2:03:47
Which, I thought I did that earlier, but okay,

Matthias Miller  2:03:50
and then click on that. Or try again, click again, second time. Type. Type his new password in, confirm the new password, and then uncheck the change

Unknown Speaker  2:04:06
whatever you want. I could put it in here,

Unknown Speaker  2:04:10
2940, SPC, lowercase, yeah. You can do lower SPC,

Unknown Speaker  2:04:19
that it, yeah, Sarah,

Unknown Speaker  2:04:23
SPC,

Matthias Miller  2:04:24
and then uncheck the Change Password, X, login, okay, and hit save

Unknown Speaker  2:04:35
eight. I need one more. Okay, 2940,

Speaker 5  2:04:41
SPC, explanation, XPC,

Unknown Speaker  2:04:45
bam,

Unknown Speaker  2:04:49
uncheck the change again, yep, okay, look at that.

Speaker 2  2:04:55
All right. Cool. If I go to I want to. Make sure that Rick had Matt that he can get what he needs on if you want accesses for that dollars per day, assembly announced report again, we're going to all customers, all items, a pay period was,

Unknown Speaker  2:05:20
what do we have?

Unknown Speaker  2:05:23
678,

Speaker 2  2:05:26
it was 731, to six, 813, was a pay period, and then we do primary grouping is the day. Secondary grouping is, well, it doesn't really matter, actually, if I just do day and hit continue, there we go. Okay, each day's each day's dollar.

Speaker 1  2:06:00
Mm, actually,

Speaker 5  2:06:05
because of the downtime they can, they're gonna have to work more, more faster than what I'm doing currently, now, because I'm not taking in consideration downtime. You know what I'm saying?

Speaker 2  2:06:24
I do, but that's not taking, like,

Unknown Speaker  2:06:28
yes,

Speaker 2  2:06:32
but it's not. It's, I mean, this is still what we're producing. There's always going to be some doubt. I don't know. Do you want to calculate it into any

Unknown Speaker  2:06:44
No, I hear what you're saying,

Matthias Miller  2:06:45
like the downtime is in the 11% though, right?

Unknown Speaker  2:06:52
I mean, it's in the historical number, right? It's, it's, it's always been,

Speaker 5  2:06:58
yeah, all time is in. I and it's in 11% the downtime. But what I'm saying is, if you take that downtime,

Unknown Speaker  2:07:15
if I take the downtime out,

Speaker 4  2:07:19
I have to figure that out. Well, it would give, it would definitely give

Speaker 2  2:07:22
the guys more Yeah, yeah, yeah, more credit. I mean, they would. It would produce the same amount, a little bit less time, if you eliminate that down, right, it would, um, but historically, if we're saying the the if we're saying the calculator is 11% because that's historical, then downtime was always baked in, and it could continue to be baked in, for simplicity, but, but Rick, I'm sure. Well anyway, that's we, you know, Rick and I were talking earlier Matt about, you know, is it 11% should it be a different number? We're gonna have to talk about that more. Yeah, here. So all right. Oh, hey, thanks. Yeah. Thank you, sir. Appreciate that. Rick, um, okay. Matt Doug, going to I had, well, any further thoughts on that part of it?

Matthias Miller  2:08:23
No, I think, I think next steps probably are digging into the again, like I said, sequencing orders, whatever first, first things first, get current data cleaned up. Next step, get Excel file cleaned up. Third step, come up with a model that correctly represents effort required for, you know, labor, right?

Speaker 2  2:08:50
Let me write this down. So clean up Excel. First we need to clean up current entries, which isn't done yet, or if John and George both need to do that, then clean up the Excel entries. And then, what was your set? What was your third one?

Matthias Miller  2:09:07
Then we need to come up with a way to calculate labor for a specific item. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  2:09:16
I have right

Matthias Miller  2:09:21
and then, and then at that point, once we calculate that, then we could very then we have a basis by which to say objectively, not just because you're running the machine versus or the A or the B, or you're doing, you're in the hands around the hand station, you're you're objectively better than average in terms

Unknown Speaker  2:09:42
of Right, right, right, right, at

Matthias Miller  2:09:46
least in terms of how we're pricing it. But yeah, yeah, yeah,

Speaker 2  2:09:52
okay. I need to, I need to hop off pretty quick here. I need to take my wife too, and. Other test. Okay, yeah, actually, I, I've got it. I should get out of here pretty fast. But, um, is that okay, Matt? I'm gonna scoot over and but I want to go over to the other side of George for quick here. Uh, John said he was communicating with you, and things were moving forward on his end. So he was okay this morning. George yellow items, I went into that a little bit with him and let me see home if I go to new orders. Yep, new orders like this, MX, MX 10, edit item. The example here is undersizers. Brewer was yes, it goes to Brewer. The other two pieces are random that doesn't run through a gang saw that is on the Excel earlier, and so this split half inch should have not it should on. It shouldn't be under size or prep. It should be under sewing prep.

Unknown Speaker  2:11:16
Um,

Speaker 2  2:11:19
my question is the migration. Could that be, or could this be clean up in a way, where this could be like, because there may be a bunch like that, right?

Matthias Miller  2:11:37
You mean where the sizer is in the the miscellaneous prep is in the wrong side,

Speaker 2  2:11:40
right? The death migrated. Shoot, that's probably my wife. Yes,

Unknown Speaker  2:11:50
okay, okay,

Unknown Speaker  2:11:53
hey, can I call you back in about 15 minutes?

Speaker 2  2:12:02
Yep, I'll check, yeah, absolutely, yep, yep, thanks, Yep,

Unknown Speaker  2:12:08
yeah. Matt's back with you.

Matthias Miller  2:12:11
Okay, so let's item. We've got the item lumber,

Speaker 2  2:12:19
Matt, I'm gonna hop off. Actually, that was one example. And then the other example was that we looked at. Was new orders. Was okay. Here was a cnh, one. Let me look at this guy quick. This was the third item, two. Napa, three. Nap eight does not come off of a sizer.

Speaker 2  2:12:52
That's probably my wife there. Hold it two nap by three and a half by cutbacks, should actually be under raw material for sawing anyway. That's a little nuance to the other

Matthias Miller  2:13:11
I think, I mean, I think, I think one of the I would propose, I don't know what to tell you, besides, can we maybe? Can I maybe get with George and figure out how we can handle these yes swaths at a time instead of one at a time, and get them cleaned up?

Speaker 2  2:13:32
Yep, that'd be great. I can try to get him. I mean, I'm sure I could perform on the phone real quick. But

Matthias Miller  2:13:39
look, let me, let me. I've got some things to chase. I want to get John T's. Got one thing. If I've got time today, I'll, I'll ping George's directly. But if it's not okay, I would almost rather early next week, if it can. I got some of the things I gotta chase today.

Speaker 2  2:13:54
That's good, man. I'll, um, I'll relay that to George. I mean, he go through one by one. But, yeah, there may be

Matthias Miller  2:14:00
some, no, there's, there's too many that are too similar, that

Unknown Speaker  2:14:05
