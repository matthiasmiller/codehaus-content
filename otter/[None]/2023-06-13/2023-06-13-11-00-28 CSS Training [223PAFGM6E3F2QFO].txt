Unknown Speaker  00:55
Got us Hey, hello,

Matthias Miller  01:04
Ben, do you happen to know if Anna's in the office this week?

Unknown Speaker  01:09
Yes she is.

Matthias Miller  01:12
Unless I've missed something I still haven't heard back from any of them

Unknown Speaker  01:16
on office stuff so

Matthias Miller  01:19
oh actually Yeah, I haven't heard back from any of them in

Speaker 1  01:24
about a little over a week. So okay is in Egypt this week? But I can check with Hannah and see see if she's at least in the email and whatnot Well, if he's in Egypt that

Matthias Miller  01:45
probably that would explain it. She's probably waiting on him for some rope. I'm gonna assume she's waiting on him for some info. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  01:52
cool. Well, we will

Matthias Miller  01:56
they're apparently not too scared about me

Unknown Speaker  01:59
missing my payment deadline so right I'm happy for

Unknown Speaker  02:07
you consider Yeah, he can continue his his career as an office squatter.

Unknown Speaker  02:14
Yeah you bet there's

Matthias Miller  02:18
commercial protection for Office squatting like there is for residential Yes, that's true.

Speaker 2  02:30
I mean, if there were you could just go spot in Joe's office and that's an idea he's gone for the week so hey, let's go move in.

Matthias Miller  02:44
Joe, I had a change of mind is this office available?

Unknown Speaker  02:49
It's

Speaker 1  02:55
completely okay. This I take it as long as they don't come and tell me how to move back and then I'm okay. Well, until

Matthias Miller  03:07
they figure it out until they figure out how much it is I can't pay so it's good here too right

Unknown Speaker  03:18
Oh wow.

Matthias Miller  03:19
Fun times. Random unrelated news before we get down to business my friends is reading a book and needed some ideas on book covers. I was like I had about an hour of downtime this morning before it's gonna hit everything else hard. So I went on Super machine the AI and or super super machine that art I think it is super machine AI whatever it is. I've gotten a lifetime access to that when it launched and started playing around with different

Unknown Speaker  03:54
different image cover ideas. Nice. The worst catastrophe

Matthias Miller  04:01
was rendering images, rendering an image with a guy with his head in his hands and literally his hands were embedded into his skull

Unknown Speaker  04:13
Am I Oh, no. No, it's very uncomfortable to me. But when you start seeing

Speaker 2  04:23
catastrophe and head in his hands I was I think that maybe it'd be like his hands out with his head in his hands like

Matthias Miller  04:34
a thinker. Imagine the thinker sculpture but

Unknown Speaker  04:45
yeah, I can be smart but

Matthias Miller  04:50
somehow I think this could be blended somehow with Greek mythology somehow somehow, like offering your intellect up to up to God as an act of worship.

Unknown Speaker  05:03
Sure. Yeah. I don't know. Still look

Unknown Speaker  05:11
a little weird.

Unknown Speaker  05:13
Okay, fair?

Speaker 1  05:21
Cool. Well, I got a hard shot in an hour and a half. So we should know we got covered. Yep.

Speaker 2  05:32
So start out with some Synvisc questions. So time tracking is seven, seven to one.

Unknown Speaker  05:40
And

Unknown Speaker  05:54
just six questions

Unknown Speaker  05:55
here.

Unknown Speaker  05:58
Talking about user groups.

Speaker 2  06:02
We got a question from Nick about shipping these, we had noted that they were going to be configured here in the solution. He was wondering why we're not shipping them, especially since we have different things that specifically reference the Super Admin and the regional rep

Unknown Speaker  06:21
admin. I mean, yeah, that's fair. I mean, it has to be a

Matthias Miller  06:32
better tools owned list item if it's referenced by

Unknown Speaker  06:35
well.

Unknown Speaker  06:50
Sorry, I was assuming we

Matthias Miller  06:51
would have some kind of permission that we control this which means that shipping it would be unnecessary. But then it should be SPECT as coming from the permission not from the user.

Speaker 2  07:04
So we would have we'd be able to set up the we'd still set up the user groups in this in the solution but the Super Admin would have a super admin permission and the regional reps would have a

Unknown Speaker  07:17
regional rep permission

Unknown Speaker  07:34
I guess so.

Unknown Speaker  07:40
He said the contact type is determining

Unknown Speaker  07:47
most of the accesses No, not

Speaker 2  07:53
just the contact type, they're all going to have the member contact

Unknown Speaker  07:57
type in

Speaker 2  08:01
think in EBS, the contact type is determining access more

Unknown Speaker  08:06
okay, we know we have a whole bunch of permissions we had a bunch of permissions so for the member

Unknown Speaker  08:22
well

Unknown Speaker  08:37
thinking

Unknown Speaker  08:47
so the all of a member type well

Unknown Speaker  08:58
I don't like this

Matthias Miller  09:03
so the Super Admins facilitators, etc all have member types as contact ex right.

Unknown Speaker  09:12
Okay, and then the super admin

Matthias Miller  09:26
so the regional rep admin and the Super Admin

Unknown Speaker  09:30
can modify

Matthias Miller  09:47
I mean, why would we have two user groups?

Unknown Speaker  09:53
No. So okay, so then we have a permission called

Matthias Miller  10:00
In the Edit All growth ring groups

Unknown Speaker  10:07
that's used for Super Admins

Unknown Speaker  10:14
so far so good or No? Sure. And then

Matthias Miller  10:20
then we have a super admin that's nothing special just has that permission turned on we have regional rep admin which is something special just has nothing special has it turned off facilitators and members nothing special the access control is determined

Unknown Speaker  10:36
by I'm going to reply to his email and see if if he email everybody

Unknown Speaker  10:48
I'm not sure that you were included on that question

Matthias Miller  10:50
about PDF click codes and biz

Unknown Speaker  10:54
user groups

Unknown Speaker  10:55
replied to Yeah, I included Hillary but

Unknown Speaker  10:59
he was good

Unknown Speaker  11:09
and how are we referencing

Matthias Miller  11:10
Super Admin throughout the proposal?

Unknown Speaker  11:15
We're just saying like

Speaker 2  11:16
you know, it's such and such is available for all Superman admins or

Unknown Speaker  11:31
Okay, can I see some examples? Or can we just search for admin that catch both so the

Speaker 2  11:43
first one here the Admin menu is visible for Super Admins and regional reps same with advanced menu visible for Super Admin

Unknown Speaker  11:53
and regional rep

Unknown Speaker  11:57
data access controls we're saying that super

Unknown Speaker  12:00
admins are you know

Unknown Speaker  12:04
are the alphas and can you and everything

Unknown Speaker  12:11
okay if for someone

Speaker 2  12:17
to be set as a regional rep on a region, they must be regional rep or superadmin.

Speaker 1  12:25
So should add add a permission.

Unknown Speaker  13:13
Permission to I'm not it's

Speaker 2  13:16
for that specific growth ring groups. I'm not sure why we have only one for growth ring groups because there's a whole bunch of other record types that that are similar. So I'm not sure why.

Unknown Speaker  13:30
That's why I'm wondering if

Speaker 2  13:31
it's a if it's an old school as this one specifically.

Speaker 1  13:36
This might be an old spec when we were starting to stack up permissions because we have all these other record types that that function similarly as far as who can view and can edit so that's

Unknown Speaker  13:58
that's a that's one question and the other question is down here

Unknown Speaker  14:01
at regarding

Unknown Speaker  14:06
regarding the how they're set up and whether they're shipped or not

Unknown Speaker  14:27
here's my proposal,

Matthias Miller  14:28
see if I can win Texas over and you can

Matthias Miller  14:46
I'm using equals for bullets because I hit equals the first time

Speaker 1  14:48
you go oh yeah, that's just horrible.

Unknown Speaker  15:04
Here's my version that didn't paste

Unknown Speaker  15:15
Is it as simple as this seems to me it is

Matthias Miller  15:27
back when I was a kid I did really good in school I got a gold star and a super on the top

Speaker 1  15:30
of the super student it's super student at least one time

Unknown Speaker  15:44
yes so and

Unknown Speaker  15:45
then if if more than one of these things apply it just looks at the highest one theoretically,

Speaker 2  15:59
someone could have all of these be true and it just looks at the highest one

Unknown Speaker  16:04
yes

Unknown Speaker  16:07
well we're it's yeah I don't know exactly how that Yeah, something like that.

Speaker 2  16:16
And then we would just have two user groups one for Admin and one for for standard No, you

Matthias Miller  16:21
have three you'd have super admin,

Unknown Speaker  16:25
regular admin and standard user. So super

Matthias Miller  16:30
admin has the BA super administrator. The regular Andrew admin is a disempowered admin is for regional reps and the standard user is the

Unknown Speaker  16:47
everybody else yeah yo yeah

Unknown Speaker  17:18
thanks

Speaker 2  17:34
yeah, so we would keep this we keep this spec here as far as the three user groups get rid of this permission note here

Speaker 1  17:45
it would have been candidate I mean, you could say I mean, you could include be a super administrator or be a super admin. I don't matter sit down in here. Okay. Oh, look at that. Dun dun dun dun so

Speaker 2  18:17
where can I just say is super admin super administrator or you do not have permission to

Matthias Miller  18:23
fill in the blank

Unknown Speaker  18:24
oh right

Unknown Speaker  18:30
so that's yeah that's the

Matthias Miller  18:33
I mean if there's you do not have permission to act as a

Unknown Speaker  18:55
I love identity based permissions

Matthias Miller  18:59
but I want to be as you know, you are not allowed to be this

Unknown Speaker  19:15
sure

Unknown Speaker  19:26
see.

Unknown Speaker  19:54
Okay, so then bring in And here's where I need to should have that OCR installed. So I can just get just the link was was that just the way

Unknown Speaker  20:18
you know it and stuff and saw that one? Okay? Just search

Unknown Speaker  20:22
online. Again this guy

Matthias Miller  20:37
geeky side of me but this is so cool how you can go back

Unknown Speaker  20:44
scroll down

Matthias Miller  20:47
drag and drop it onto that left side.

Unknown Speaker  20:50
Oh, you're right. Okay. This is

Matthias Miller  20:54
literally a software program that got converted into JavaScript so that it could run in

Unknown Speaker  20:59
a web page, which I think is Nevermind, it's a pure JavaScript port. Nevermind. There's some other things that they've done kind of like that. But that's crazy.

Unknown Speaker  21:16
I have to save it. Right?

Unknown Speaker  21:20
Yeah, you probably have to save it here. Yeah, it doesn't support paste.

Unknown Speaker  21:28
Meanwhile, this is taking about as long as it would take to

Speaker 1  21:34
retype it, or you type it, but I have is cool.

Unknown Speaker  22:01
There we go.

Speaker 1  22:16
Didn't catch those initial spaces very well.

Speaker 2  22:22
Okay, cool. So we can work on just clarifying that.

Unknown Speaker  22:37
So then that means

Speaker 2  22:37
within all of that to this question about shipping the user groups,

Unknown Speaker  22:44
we don't need to shift. I think it's unnecessary but

Unknown Speaker  22:55
only super admins would be able to edit user groups.

Unknown Speaker  23:00
Right? Were we say that?

Speaker 2  23:05
Oh, no regional reps would need to be able to do it to to set up additional members.

Unknown Speaker  23:16
But there wouldn't be a ton of people with access to that.

Unknown Speaker  23:24
What is the disadvantage to shipping them? Well, I mean, it's not meaningful.

Unknown Speaker  23:39
Sure, like

Matthias Miller  23:40
the difference between a regional rep. And I mean, facilitator and member is

Unknown Speaker  23:45
like the only meaningful difference

Matthias Miller  23:51
is the Super Admin.

Unknown Speaker  23:55
Why wouldn't we?

Matthias Miller  23:58
Why wouldn't we allow multiple Super Admins,

Unknown Speaker  24:01
multiple

Matthias Miller  24:06
reps while we allow primary and secondary reps in a region.

Unknown Speaker  24:16
And then at that point,

Matthias Miller  24:17
the only user groups you need are administrators and standard users. Which makes a whole lot more sense than mixing metaphors. And then you take your super admins and you add them to

Unknown Speaker  24:30
all the regions.

Speaker 2  24:37
Sure, then you've got to every time you set up a new region, you have to add all of the

Speaker 1  24:42
Super Admins to it. Yep. How many times we're adding new regions

Unknown Speaker  24:52
know me early on is gonna be

Unknown Speaker  24:55
more frequent and then they have a new admin how many times are we adding Super Admins?

Unknown Speaker  25:06
I'm not sure. Or you put something

Unknown Speaker  25:19
that feels more

Matthias Miller  25:19
complicated to me on the user side to do it that way. Alright, we'll try this. So I mean, here's the fun fundamental question, do you optimize for operational simplicity or, or conceptual software simplicity. And is probably my bias bleeding through. But I think,

Unknown Speaker  25:43
operational complexities, less expensive

Matthias Miller  25:46
than software complexity. But that's an aside, we could add a checkbox to a member that says this is the Super Admin, and you deploy it on the contact record. And then you still have to use a group administrators and standard users.

Unknown Speaker  26:10
Sure,

Unknown Speaker  26:13
so then this right here becomes

Unknown Speaker  26:19
he has a checkbox checked, checkbox checked on his contact. Now, what do I not like

Matthias Miller  26:28
about it? Well, it's kind of weird that that's defined on the contact record instead of on the user profile, but every every other permissions defined

Unknown Speaker  26:38
via database records.

Unknown Speaker  27:01
Are we automatically

Matthias Miller  27:01
creating user profiles? In any way?

Unknown Speaker  27:08
Yes, that's part of like, when you set up a new member,

Speaker 1  27:13
there's a button to activate membership. And it it creates a user profile for them and links it to the contact record, if it's not already created and linked.

Matthias Miller  27:48
So if somebody's regional rep, and you take them off the regional rep, and you reassign them, what's going to drop them down to a standard user standard user permissions?

Unknown Speaker  27:56
Does that happen automatically?

Unknown Speaker  28:01
Have that design so automatically?

Unknown Speaker  28:02
No. Doesn't matter?

Speaker 2  28:11
No, it just be we'd have to. It's a good point, we have to add a warning on safe when that happens.

Speaker 1  28:17
To tell them the get to tell the user to go change the guy back to a standard user. If we don't have the wave, it doesn't happen automatically. So having this

Speaker 2  28:35
checkbox on the contact record record might be the cleanest?

Unknown Speaker  28:39
Well, either way, we're still going to have to even if it's just one ad viewed,

Matthias Miller  28:44
if it's between it's time to send your user someone

Unknown Speaker  28:47
it still has to be yes.

Matthias Miller  28:54
argue with me, but tell me this isn't

Speaker 1  28:59
much simpler to manage. You're saying that the checkbox on the contact record? Yes. Much less confusing. Yeah.

Speaker 2  29:14
And then you're thinking or even be that warning on save in the region? To remind them to change the user group or,

Unknown Speaker  29:23
or background process that would run and basically by virtue if. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  29:32
if they're not on a user group, if they're not on a region,

Unknown Speaker  29:36
then it changes them back to standard member. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  29:52
Which means you'll

Matthias Miller  29:52
still have to sift these records in some form or fashion if we're doing automation to switch between these

Unknown Speaker  29:56
two groups.

Unknown Speaker  30:08
I don't know

Unknown Speaker  30:16
the end of the day

Speaker 1  30:23
probably doesn't matter the last thing that would.

Unknown Speaker  31:28
Well, I'm about to come full circle

Matthias Miller  31:31
and say nevermind, we need to ship these, we need to update them automatically somehow anyway,

Unknown Speaker  31:35
let's just go ahead and ship the original grapes.

Matthias Miller  31:38
Keep the keep the super administrator permission and or,

Speaker 1  31:42
or skip it entirely. Just know that they're part of this well. Yeah, no, they're

Matthias Miller  31:50
part of the super administrator group

Unknown Speaker  32:03
Wait, well who are we

Matthias Miller  32:27
we have four groups, one for each role, we now support multiple roles. And we have an automated process that keeps it in sync with what the role actually is or should be.

Unknown Speaker  32:46
And the only thing it's used for

Matthias Miller  32:49
is so that we can enforce permissions based off of role

Unknown Speaker  33:06
I believe in this?

Unknown Speaker  34:07
How many regions are there? Currently, I think they only have

Speaker 2  34:16
I think currently are as of March at the summit. They only had two regional reps. And I think maybe only had two or three or four regions but it's something that

Unknown Speaker  34:25
there the plan is to expand it and you have multiple regions

Unknown Speaker  34:30
all across the US and Canada.

Unknown Speaker  35:05
Third and final iteration

Unknown Speaker  35:17
I don't know.

Speaker 1  36:02
Yet one more variation, it's not really better is putting this person

Unknown Speaker  36:58
there is no single best way

Matthias Miller  37:04
a few variations, but a list of super administrators on the posting settings page. People can be members of multiple groups, ship user groups for each level of membership, and then allow them to configure that however they want to. And people can be part of multiple groups. As in everybody's part of the member group, facilitators are member of the facilitator member group.

Unknown Speaker  37:34
You know, et cetera, et cetera. And then the

Matthias Miller  37:41
are you a super administrator lives either on the contact record, which makes it easy to you know, recognize when you deactivate the user, or it could be on App postings on settings, which is this master list of Super

Speaker 1  37:58
Admins. Or it could be a permission. In which case

Matthias Miller  38:10
I don't know I'm quite frankly lost in the possibilities and I can't really, I think it's six of one and a half a dozen of the other and there's not a clear winner in my mind.

Matthias Miller  38:31
If I had to draw a choice, it's checkbox on the contact to make a super administrator.

Unknown Speaker  38:39
And it's a report alert when whether we think somebody

Matthias Miller  38:49
should manage users does not equal whether they can actually manage users. And that would only be available to

Unknown Speaker  38:57
people who can manage users.

Unknown Speaker  39:07
That's it over that our automatic creation.

Matthias Miller  39:13
And then we ship a standard user and administrator user group and our automation assigned it to the person we think you should be a member of based on their

Speaker 1  39:21
membership status. If that's even necessary, might be

Matthias Miller  39:35
the thing that's really driving me crazy is the fact that we need to duplicate this information across

Speaker 1  39:39
multiple sources. That just seems really obnoxious to me. But I don't see a path around it. Would it? Would it be better to have we had

Speaker 2  39:54
this if we have the super admin checkbox on the contact record?

Unknown Speaker  39:58
Would it be better to How'd it work to have three checkboxes one

Speaker 2  40:04
is super admin one is regional rep and one actually for one reach level and the lower three are all macros

Unknown Speaker  40:18
based on the other information but then

Unknown Speaker  40:24
the check box is is what

Unknown Speaker  40:26
the system looks at so it's not duplicating as much that makes sense sorry so on the contact

Speaker 2  40:44
record, we would have four checkboxes one for each level of membership.

Unknown Speaker  40:48
And

Speaker 2  40:55
standard member facilitator and regional rep would all be filled automatically based on on these things assigned to a region facilitator just just as a member or actually just

Unknown Speaker  41:09
an active membership and then superadmin would

Speaker 2  41:14
be based on that checkbox it would be manually checked or cleared and then those checkboxes would become a source of truth I mean, yeah, those will be what the system looks at to give them the permissions

Unknown Speaker  41:29
so what I really like random raccoon getting ready to attack my neighbor's house

Unknown Speaker  41:43
and they're nocturnal animals

Matthias Miller  41:44
so doesn't that mean there's a high likelihood of rabies

Unknown Speaker  41:51
the what I really liked about this

Matthias Miller  41:56
here's what I just absolutely love about this it creates visibility into permissions and how the system works

Unknown Speaker  42:06
hmm And I like it

Matthias Miller  42:28
and then the main remaining piece is we still need to ship administrators versus standard users. So that we can differentiate between who can manage other user accounts

Unknown Speaker  42:41
and who can't

Unknown Speaker  42:49
say what we need to ship

Unknown Speaker  42:56
what would we ship

Matthias Miller  42:56
is that administrator and standard user user groups

Unknown Speaker  43:13
and asked to determine who can edit

Unknown Speaker  43:17
and who can add or remove

Matthias Miller  43:20
user profiles

Unknown Speaker  43:36
so then this would be.

Speaker 1  44:47
And we would say that all of these all of these checkboxes

Speaker 2  44:56
could be checked at the same time and we just like talked about earlier we We'd look at the highest one.

Unknown Speaker  45:45
And then we would have

Speaker 2  46:03
we have a background process or do we just have a report alert to tell the Super Admins when to change

Unknown Speaker  46:11
user groups

Unknown Speaker  46:22
we do wish

Matthias Miller  46:23
we could do that we should make sure that we don't

Unknown Speaker  46:27
we never disable CCI users there's a macro for it I forget what it's called. Okay.

Speaker 2  46:38
We say we we could do which the report alert or the the automatic process

Matthias Miller  46:44
I don't really care whether it's report alert or automatic process but

Unknown Speaker  46:47
Okay.

Unknown Speaker  47:47
So from a

Speaker 2  47:53
back to this question of background process or reboiler,

Speaker 1  47:56
which is which is faster cheaper to code

Unknown Speaker  48:08
we just do it nightly. And are we okay with it not happening immediately.

Speaker 2  48:14
It would be okay with it has not happened to me at least for for users that are

Unknown Speaker  48:18
removed.

Speaker 2  48:20
If someone's done being a facilitator, but when someone's being added as a facilitator or regional rep, or super admin, you likely would want them to have that

Unknown Speaker  48:29
that ability starting right away. Which would mean a button I guess.

Speaker 2  48:44
Like if we do if we do the x 30 It's going to be it's going to be more likely

Unknown Speaker  48:49
to break or more.

Speaker 2  48:54
More likely, but more the risk there is something breaking

Unknown Speaker  48:58
something not being handled right.

Speaker 2  49:02
The risk of the report alert is that the admins might not

Unknown Speaker  49:06
follow up on it. Well, there's a turnaround time to right. Well, I mean, it's as simple as

Unknown Speaker  49:27
having a

Matthias Miller  49:30
does this contact is this having a macro is this contact assigned to the right user group.

Unknown Speaker  49:36
And if not,

Matthias Miller  49:38
then you have a fixed button that runs the fix x 30. And you have that on the contact record. You have the regional rep and you have that on

Unknown Speaker  49:47
the regional group that's easy. You basically You

Unknown Speaker  50:00
can save the record if that button is

Unknown Speaker  50:04
the button or you can save it might just warn or something

Matthias Miller  50:23
or you could say that it could be something like one or more users permissions need to be updated for one or more users

Unknown Speaker  50:39
permission permissions for up for user permissions will be updated

Unknown Speaker  50:50
will be updated tonight and then a

Matthias Miller  50:58
one more user permissions will be updated tonight and then have a

Unknown Speaker  51:01
a fix now button

Matthias Miller  51:10
I'm pretty sure this doesn't fall into the elegant user interface

Speaker 1  51:17
I'm concerned but what we need

Unknown Speaker  51:38
we

Matthias Miller  51:41
Okay, there are still two things that are blatant gaps in the framework number one dependent record modifications so if you modify this record go update these other records

Unknown Speaker  52:09
don't know if we have to do that

Unknown Speaker  52:10
for any records other than

Unknown Speaker  52:15
other than the user user profile

Unknown Speaker  52:25
Well, I mean I think yeah, maybe I'm not sure

Unknown Speaker  52:35
the other thing that would be useful is is

Unknown Speaker  52:48
enforcing record relationships which might not be necessary but

Unknown Speaker  53:03
what do you mean by by enforcing record relationships

Unknown Speaker  53:04
remember is not

Matthias Miller  53:10
active if the contact is inactive then in this kind of ease then they should not be a member or if they are a member the content should be active. Like we're there's two states between two records that need to be should be kept in sync.

Unknown Speaker  53:30
I think we already have that.

Matthias Miller  53:33
I'm saying that should be a platform construct.

Unknown Speaker  53:36
Oh I see what you're saying.

Unknown Speaker  53:38
Not you're not talking about this this design specifically you're talking the platform so yeah gotcha anyway

Unknown Speaker  54:20
so you're good with this. Taking this one as proposal back to CCI think thanks. So they say

Speaker 1  55:07
All right, I'm just gonna put some things here for us to fill out. And this is mean to clarify what we're splitting but active membership there

Unknown Speaker  55:47
okay

Unknown Speaker  55:57
and I'll just make a note here

Speaker 1  56:34
and then when we ship with shipping

Speaker 2  56:38
user groups like that, should we disable the ability to create new user groups?

Speaker 1  56:42
If someone goes in there with good or bad intentions and creates a new user group will that cause any problems? allow them access to things they shouldn't? No, not really. I

Matthias Miller  56:57
mean, they can only do that if they're an administrator. So

Unknown Speaker  57:03
okay

Unknown Speaker  57:10
all right. Cool.

Unknown Speaker  57:23
Okay, let's

Speaker 2  57:24
see if we can put the rest of these quickly. On the development resource record. CCI mentioned that, okay, we here we have a status, which is a drop list. And we have a status date.

Unknown Speaker  57:43
But we, on the report,

Speaker 2  57:49
we have filters for submitted date and approved date. And so but we didn't have separate dates here on the record. So I've added a submitted date, the defaults, the creation date, technically, we can just pull this date from the created date down at the bottom of the the record. But it feels like it might be again for user experience might be clear to have

Speaker 1  58:15
some special place on the record. Sure, are you good with that? I'm fine with that. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  58:25
and then so then on the report for that filter, it would look at that submitted date for submitted date

Speaker 1  58:32
and the if the status is approved, then it would look at the status date because that would be the status date there

Unknown Speaker  58:49
okay

Speaker 2  58:52
this is a question from CCI is well on the knowledge tree entry record

Unknown Speaker  59:00
we have a branch

Unknown Speaker  59:06
i Wait a minute oh I'm on the wrong

Unknown Speaker  59:09
this needs to be clarify this knowledge tree branch knowledge street entry right

Unknown Speaker  59:30
so we have an ID and we also have a branch name.

Unknown Speaker  59:41
So your thoughts on on his question there

Unknown Speaker  1:00:00
I don't know why we need branch ID okay

Matthias Miller  1:00:17
we're validating against duplicate duplicate names with first single contact.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:25
Implicitly so yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:32
Now if contacts ever change

Speaker 2  1:00:35
the future to be able to automatically handled or cleanly handled duplicate contact

Unknown Speaker  1:00:38
names will that cause that will cause problems for this? But we just burn that bridge we get to it. Sorry, if, if we

Speaker 2  1:00:55
if our kind of our standard contacts module changes in the future to allow us to handle duplicate contact names more cleanly.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:04
Just be able to handle duplicate contact names.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:08
That will cause problems for this, but do we just

Unknown Speaker  1:01:12
know because I mean,

Matthias Miller  1:01:15
the idea is still going to be the person. The idea represents the individual person.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:22
So, so include that idea at that point. Yeah, sure. Okay, so John

Matthias Miller  1:01:31
John. Stoltzfus contact ID one, John Stoll system, Pennsylvania, John Stoltzfus from Ohio contact ID one in contact ID two still dealing with names that their branches are pound or one pound or two

Unknown Speaker  1:01:51
Sure.

Unknown Speaker  1:02:28
All right.

Unknown Speaker  1:02:44
Alright, want to get your thought on.

Speaker 2  1:02:48
This one, the view development resources report. We were planning to do this as a multiplayer recap, we're planning to do this multiplayer report. Less pain is the resources, right pane is reduced for the selected resource.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:06
And

Speaker 2  1:03:09
it's the left hand itself is fairly large. Just from your perspective, we were going to do a backup, we were going to do the full development resource reviews report on there for the right team, which also is somewhat large.

Speaker 1  1:03:26
If we, so I think we're going to do a few columns here. Like name as a link and date or something. Do we need to spec out a whole nother report?

Unknown Speaker  1:03:48
For that, are we can can we just say that the right page should have these columns?

Matthias Miller  1:03:56
No, I mean, one option would I think would be probably be reasonable. I don't know if Ellis cares about it. But there's a lot of complexity in the report just adding a view

Unknown Speaker  1:04:03
which is simplified versus in depth or

Matthias Miller  1:04:10
something like that, or a checkbox or something like that. And control visibility

Unknown Speaker  1:04:15
of those additional columns that we're splitting for

Unknown Speaker  1:04:22
there'll be a checkbox to

Unknown Speaker  1:04:23
hide hide some columns, right Gotcha.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:58
Don't like that?

Unknown Speaker  1:05:06
definitely add some complexity but someone who has a big screen and wants to do it good although if we ended up giving them a nicer interface for this then it would make it more complicated I don't know

Speaker 2  1:05:31
if we're gonna go for a mobile interface I almost would just say to this take away the

Unknown Speaker  1:05:37
let's take away the right pane

Unknown Speaker  1:05:45
sorry for mobile interface

Speaker 2  1:05:46
if we do a mobile interface I just want to take away the left pane to make it less Comparable

Matthias Miller  1:05:51
interface has to be completely custom

Unknown Speaker  1:05:56
like sure

Matthias Miller  1:05:58
this shouldn't I mean I don't think we should think about mobile for the sake of what we're doing here Sure.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:15
Okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:06:16
well that is

Unknown Speaker  1:06:19
for now

Speaker 1  1:06:35
and either if you want a break before we continue Good, keep going another point that so time go for bet okay. So just some narrow general stuff here. And some bears All right, so zfp accounting tapes job here Oh,

Speaker 2  1:07:16
good question Matthias through all these zfp CTRs should those be billed directly to mark or an insight or should they be billed to LS

Unknown Speaker  1:07:32
spine billing them to Mark Okay

Unknown Speaker  1:07:42
all right. So in this question here

Unknown Speaker  1:07:47
from the client

Speaker 2  1:07:49
I suggested setting this up to get input from Ellison Joel LS replied here figured it might be easiest just to see what response feedback you have Matthias

Unknown Speaker  1:07:59
you're on a call

Unknown Speaker  1:08:24
well

Speaker 1  1:08:43
how does any other accounting software deal with this?

Unknown Speaker  1:09:25
Are you looking something up for you just for

Matthias Miller  1:09:27
Yeah, I'm looking something up

Unknown Speaker  1:09:34
don't know how to find what I'm looking for.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:06
Just to make sure I'm understanding

Unknown Speaker  1:10:06
it correctly here Elysa saying this is where the apparent context disappears and this is where

Speaker 1  1:10:14
he's concerned about it

Speaker 1  1:10:27
well here's another option option C do everything in reverse order

Unknown Speaker  1:10:46
so instead of doing you would do

Speaker 1  1:11:15
do a mix up of the two so raw material let's do this

Unknown Speaker  1:11:28
well kind of but not quite

Unknown Speaker  1:11:41
maybe in parentheses

Unknown Speaker  1:12:03
remember that should be formatted

Unknown Speaker  1:12:11
yeah

Matthias Miller  1:12:11
I mean maybe it's parentheses maybe it's but you show the reverse hierarchy right

Unknown Speaker  1:12:33
see if it works for anybody

Unknown Speaker  1:13:25
okay like that could work

Speaker 1  1:13:49
all right we're gonna send that out next one let's actually hit zfp Here this is the email about

Unknown Speaker  1:14:11
rolling out features

Unknown Speaker  1:14:35
just wanted to

Speaker 2  1:14:36
follow up on this talking about automation and whatnot. I guess time tracking on this one. What should

Matthias Miller  1:14:45
this is just CSM it can be 67646764

Unknown Speaker  1:14:54
Sounds like well I have it pulled up here.

Matthias Miller  1:14:59
I've got a quick plus I've got a special time report that makes me look smart and smarter than I am

Unknown Speaker  1:15:16
so here's my proposal

Unknown Speaker  1:15:29
Don't try that

Unknown Speaker  1:15:43
Oh, interesting

Unknown Speaker  1:15:51
so is this the second

Speaker 1  1:16:01
pulls the body from the testing job

Speaker 2  1:16:09
and it shows the parent purchase the CR.

Unknown Speaker  1:16:19
Status nice. How do you get the status here? Is that based on the change request status? No, I

Matthias Miller  1:16:36
did something that I actually argued against

Unknown Speaker  1:16:51
ah ready start banging down your door

Unknown Speaker  1:17:05
nice.

Matthias Miller  1:17:06
I don't know what it says about selfish interests when your team members ask for something and you shoot it down until you actually need it. And then you go build it, but

Speaker 1  1:17:17
I mean, it means you. You get good ideas for

Unknown Speaker  1:17:21
your team members.

Matthias Miller  1:17:23
That said yesterday

Speaker 2  1:17:31
itself is interest only probably comes in if you don't share it.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:35
But just reframe

Matthias Miller  1:17:38
it's not selfish. It's just humility to go back and say I was wrong.

Speaker 1  1:17:41
Maybe I believe in this. A go. So it goes back a year goes back a year, okay.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:01
So then it just looks

Unknown Speaker  1:18:02
at the most recent update

Speaker 1  1:18:07
coming here after the most recent update is live. Anything

Matthias Miller  1:18:14
between that one and the prior one? Sorry, anything after that is testing the test system? Anything prior to that is considered live? And is it accurate? 100%. Accurate, new,

Unknown Speaker  1:18:26
it's not. But I think it's good enough accurate.

Speaker 1  1:18:35
So is this something that we can then use to to default this?

Matthias Miller  1:18:42
If somebody wants to spec it out? Yes. It means standardizing this list or probably what should happen. This is a quick and dirty thing. But probably what should happen is do we have subdomain records at this point?

Unknown Speaker  1:18:58
I think that

Speaker 2  1:19:00
is one of the jobs sitting on a change request that actually just came up for me the other day.

Matthias Miller  1:19:08
So the main thing is we need to link a we need to link a subdomain and the subscription a subscription code to its primary subdomain. As in we should know that insight is Yfp.

Speaker 1  1:19:24
And test Assist is zfp. But we should not but that's not relevant. sense. Sure.

Matthias Miller  1:19:36
And I could do this from my end too. We could exclude any subdomains that are test and deploy. And that gets us I mean, that should work. cleaner solution is feeling this as this is the live system.

Matthias Miller  1:20:00
In this

Unknown Speaker  1:20:01
in the billing system

Unknown Speaker  1:20:27
and so

Matthias Miller  1:20:33
I was on a call this morning with

Speaker 1  1:20:36
one of my Facebook friends. And we were talking and she's like you are, she's like,

Matthias Miller  1:20:47
over the 20 years that I've talked to how many 1000s of people she's like, there's a handful of people that I see who are truly mad scientists. And she's like, you're one of those people. And you need to stop using your man's mad scientist to solve problems. You need to get yourself in a fully stocked laboratory with all the tools and everything that you need. And you need to just go in the laboratory and play in the laboratory. And then you need somebody who can come ducking into your laboratory and take inventory of all the concoctions and inventions and things that you've made, and can go out and do market research and find out what people's problems are and you need somebody else who matches up your inventions to the problems goes and makes money off of them.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:28
Like what's interesting huh? Yeah. Should Ask for an Einstein shirt for Father's Day. Daddy Einstein. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway,

Matthias Miller  1:21:57
so this is this is one of those mad scientist things, where it's like, here's something from the laboratory, it's fairly fun, functional, and definitely not production quality, and you need to massage it into something that actually works for operationally but I can hand it off to somebody else to figure out all those details. That's amazing. That's probably the best use of that better use of my time than

Speaker 1  1:22:28
not that I can't but very small time and that

Matthias Miller  1:22:34
something to think about them is what happens when testing

Unknown Speaker  1:22:36
do we assume

Matthias Miller  1:22:42
that went a job is is it based on?

Unknown Speaker  1:22:46
Do we have a coded date? Is it based

Matthias Miller  1:22:49
on the testing closed date? If it's based on the testing closed date, then do we assume that if the testing closed date is on the day of update that it was like do we assume it was included or do we assume it was not included? Etc. Like do you want to in the case of approximation, do you want to err on the side which side you want to do you want to err on the side of optimism or pessimism basically

Unknown Speaker  1:23:16
right

Speaker 1  1:23:43
I need to relocate What else do we have? Um Just make here

Speaker 2  1:24:12
so anyway back to this in this report that you showed this one. You You're saying this one we could use as basically a say look at this every Monday morning and see which ones are

Matthias Miller  1:24:31
this is one that I would be comfortable with sending directly out to market join.

Unknown Speaker  1:24:39
So he wouldn't have

Unknown Speaker  1:24:40
access to cch those we need to

Speaker 1  1:24:43
print it. Right. Or put it in an email

Matthias Miller  1:24:53
my call with my Wednesday call with Dwayne

Unknown Speaker  1:24:57
sorry, you gotta say

Matthias Miller  1:25:00
I have this girl go by email to mark, Dwayne and I, and on my Monday call with Mark, we go over it. And we figure out what needs to be done on implementation on the accounting side and on the call with Dwayne, make sure that he's got things on his plate, we'll end to where we figure out the implementation plan for anything. That's,

Unknown Speaker  1:25:21
that's leftover. And

Matthias Miller  1:25:22
that's our process.

Unknown Speaker  1:25:30
So the main thing

Matthias Miller  1:25:30
that needs to happen is creating an email. I mean, I guess it could just be an email reminder.

Unknown Speaker  1:25:38
Probably with

Matthias Miller  1:25:41
the stuff going out Monday morning.

Unknown Speaker  1:25:45
So yeah,

Speaker 2  1:25:50
so then, does this what are the filters on this? Does this show the ones from the most recent updates or anything since the update? Or what

Matthias Miller  1:25:59
is the what is this? It doesn't currently what it should have is a subscription code. And we're it should have a subdomain and a and or a subscription code which could be inferred from the subdomain however, you end up doing that. And then it should

Speaker 1  1:26:17
show number of releases. And it should show the and it should show whether to include unreleased work

Speaker 1  1:26:43
and the number of releases is saying how many times back into the past to include on the report?

Matthias Miller  1:26:54
Is it just the is it for the it's the number of dates

Speaker 1  1:26:58
to reference? Okay. In there

Matthias Miller  1:27:10
okay, I mean, I really do have to go. Okay.

Speaker 2  1:27:13
Well, that's, that's good. I'll send out a draft of this email and we can follow up from there

Unknown Speaker  1:27:23
all right. Talk to you later. All right, sounds good.

Unknown Speaker  1:27:38
Okay,

Speaker 2  1:27:39
well we will plan to move this up to next time.

Speaker 1  1:27:45
This should be six, four t now 5030.

Unknown Speaker  1:28:04
And

Speaker 2  1:28:05
I'll send out this draft or this email

Unknown Speaker  1:28:08
and

Speaker 1  1:28:15
we're gonna have a little bit more and then we can go from there. Not one and yeah, I think that's

Speaker 2  1:28:30
be it for now. Anything you need for me here?

Unknown Speaker  1:28:35
We drop I don't think so. Okay, sounds good.

Speaker 1  1:28:50
Well, then we can call it a wrap and see you on the team correlator Sounds good. All right. Bye.
