Okay, so I'm going to walk through the ATP checklist, and so I'm going to be updating the checklist as we go. So there's a slight chance that, I mean, this will take a little bit of time to get completely nailed down, but I'll be putting sample language and stuff in here, so just follow along. So this is, this is for the sample. Here's where shit happens, and I'm going to grab their website here. And Alright, so first things, first, identify and list all forms on your website that collect phone numbers, and so we're going to go here, and let's just go through this process.

Unknown Speaker  00:56

Matthias Miller  00:59
VIP list, no design your shed 2024 shed pricing looks like it could be contact us, name, email subject, doesn't have idea room as just a pricing sheet. I

Matthias Miller  01:29
um, That's very Interesting. I'm

Matthias Miller  02:24
okay, well, so the only place this is is on the homepage, and it doesn't even have a phone number. So in order to

Matthias Miller  02:37
here, maybe we should just, I don't know if you want to do this, but We could do insert a variable here. Come on. I'm

Matthias Miller  03:07
I that makes it hard, so we're not going to do

Unknown Speaker  03:12
that. Just going to do this.

Matthias Miller  03:19
What if we just did this? Insert Table, building blocks, just going to do your URL

Speaker 1  03:30
and purpose just like this.

Matthias Miller  03:36
And so here I'm

Unknown Speaker  03:44
okay,

Matthias Miller  03:45
so did not expect to run into this, but ensure that at least one of the forms collects a phone number. Okay, so here what we're going to do, first things first, things first. We're going to edit this, or actually we're going to go in the back

Unknown Speaker  04:10
