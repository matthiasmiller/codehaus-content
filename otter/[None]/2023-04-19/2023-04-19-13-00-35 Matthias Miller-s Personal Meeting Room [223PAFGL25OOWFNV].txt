Unknown Speaker  00:40
Yo yo ye knows this in your

Speaker 1  00:54
seat this una siesta our Rita you need more

Speaker 2  01:00
than a siesta there is there is one thing that makes me extremely tired it is dealing with mind boggling amounts of finished good buildings that need to be reconciled just makes my head want to explode I cannot Josh was telling me about these people at Investor tools their entire job is to take financial statements from these large institutions and entering them manually entering them in matching up their you know, record cat or their their financial category with the way investor tools looks at it. And they're doing this with some tools but mostly manual. Dude, my head would just like my head wanted to explode just hearing him talk about it like there are people who

Unknown Speaker  01:57
like doing this. No. But apparently, apparently there are apparently there are oddly there are well,

Speaker 2  02:12
nothing complete thankfully for thankfully there are but

Speaker 1  02:17
we are also one of the jobs that is liable to get replaced.

Speaker 2  02:26
That is not me. Not me. Me. All right, dealers zip code assignment reports. Sorry, quick

Matthias Miller  02:36
question before we get there. What is a Is it reasonable if we know that nobody's making any phone should be making any phone calls after 9pm to automatically clock out all round robin dealers at 9pm? Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  02:47
Any reason not to Okay. Um,

Speaker 2  02:50
no. Okay. 9pm What? eastern central? Eastern?

Matthias Miller  03:00
Oh, because you guys have somebody in central don't you?

Unknown Speaker  03:03
Have some we have somebody in Pacific.

Speaker 1  03:07
Oh, you have somebody in Pacific? Calling Eastern folks. Central folks. No, it would be late. What is California Pacific?

Matthias Miller  03:17
California specific. You guys are building out there? No. Say that's the young guy but he's still talking to people in Central time. So, so 1015 to be generous. Like he shouldn't be calling somebody in central time after 9pm He wouldn't be calling

Speaker 2  03:39
Well, I mean, I guess potentially. Okay, okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, where were we

Unknown Speaker  03:47
what is

Speaker 2  03:48
the western part of Indiana what's what timezone? Is that mountain time? Now that'd be Central time. Yeah. 9pm Central is fair.

Unknown Speaker  04:02
Okay, I'll do 1005 Eastern

Unknown Speaker  04:06
Well, I mean, I guess it doesn't really make a difference for weight club

Unknown Speaker  04:12
he's round robin.

Unknown Speaker  04:13
What is what is clocking what is what is clocking out do

Matthias Miller  04:18
it gets the leads distribute. I mean, if somebody bids basically somebody forgot to clock out and it distributes the leads across the whole group.

Unknown Speaker  04:26
But for Indiana, they're not doing that anyway, are they?

Speaker 1  04:29
Yeah, well, I guess it doesn't really matter for them but

Speaker 2  04:34
it doesn't really matter for them. Okay, whatever you want to do there. Okay. If you do it, you should probably just send out an email. Not an email a. I don't care discord or something to true point. North Carolina truepoint Indiana just saying that well, particularly. Indiana because I think they there's they aren't expecting to clock in because they don't actually use the clock and I think they stayed clocked in. But if you're going to if you're going to do that, then just don't need to know that they have to click the clock in to get their screens back.

Matthias Miller  05:16
Right. Once I asked you about a district prompt, and just do it for North Carolina,

Unknown Speaker  05:21
you can do that.

Speaker 1  05:25
Okay, fine. That solves all the other problems. Okay.

Speaker 2  05:38
Let's go into what report am I going to look for?

Matthias Miller  05:43
You wanted to see if my fancy report to you could be handled to accommodate.

Speaker 2  05:54
I update the zip code list. I don't know if I necessarily want I mean, it's up to you. You're saying to where we could actually do it based on an area and they wouldn't overlap? Is that what you're going after?

Matthias Miller  06:03
Yeah. And it would auto calculated and all this stuff?

Unknown Speaker  06:08
I don't know if I care a ton.

Matthias Miller  06:10
Okay. Well, if you don't hear time, then let's keep it moving.

Speaker 2  06:14
Yeah, agreed. Schedule for consolidating portals, can I just run away? I don't want to.

Unknown Speaker  06:22
That's just someone to either.

Speaker 2  06:25
I'm glad we're on the same page, but not wanting to. I don't want to just it's not a matter of not wanting to do it. It's a matter of moaning about the fact of doing it.

Matthias Miller  06:38
Well, I think we just go pick a time and block out a two hour window or something. That's

Unknown Speaker  06:44
next to it.

Unknown Speaker  06:48
That next week.

Unknown Speaker  06:51
I have all this

Speaker 2  06:52
finished good stuff done sales taxes done. All the big things looming over my head are done. So

Matthias Miller  07:00
it's probably going to be in may sometime. So but for me to get in touch, fine.

Unknown Speaker  07:09
Inputting emails into the CRM.

Matthias Miller  07:13
That reminds me, there's a few changes I need from Josh on that, that would be nice to have.

Unknown Speaker  07:16
I think I don't know that we need that. Is that a matter of

Matthias Miller  07:26
working with Daniel and telling him how to set it up and assist?

Speaker 2  07:29
Does it assist? Or is it is it the console?

Speaker 1  07:37
Well, we need to set up a mail app password in their in their user email, link into assist. And then an Assist will auto

Matthias Miller  07:48
import the emails into their

Unknown Speaker  07:53
Yeah, talk to Daniel.

Unknown Speaker  07:55
Is it per email that you have to do that?

Matthias Miller  07:57
Yeah, each of the each dealers email

Speaker 2  08:01
and male at work? No, I don't. I don't have brain power to think about just deal with all.

Speaker 1  08:08
Okay, I need to let me give you know.

Speaker 2  08:14
I mean, if I need to know, I'll I'll know. So

Matthias Miller  08:18
it's more like an interesting thing that you might need to know. And that, basically, since I'm not going to stop myself from telling you, Google doesn't like you putting your username and password into third party systems.

Speaker 2  08:31
Yes. Do we need to give Oh, yeah, well, you gotta go in as I know what you're talking about. Now, yeah, you gotta you gotta go tell it to you gotta go author. Yes. I know what you're talking about. He does too. What do we have to do it for?

Unknown Speaker  08:48
Glory level you probably have to, huh? Yeah. Well,

Unknown Speaker  08:53
yeah, I'm familiar with what you're talking about.

Matthias Miller  08:57
Okay, so I'm working on offline conversions conversion imports. And is this the right set if a

Unknown Speaker  09:05
fine conversion inputs we're talking about

Unknown Speaker  09:09
when a Google Click translates into a sale? We want to tell Google Yeah,

Speaker 2  09:17
but how are you going to? How do you Okay, quantifiably? How are you going to figure out whether it turned into a sale or not?

Unknown Speaker  09:25
Because I want to know this too.

Matthias Miller  09:28
I won't find out every time but I'll find out.

Unknown Speaker  09:32
A lot of the time.

Speaker 2  09:38
Okay, so here's here's, here's a prime example. So there was a what was the customer's name? Jeff know something. It's a Floyd sale. When he he requested a quote under one email. And then when Floyd talks to him, he says, oh, send it to this email so that you notes don't match now. So there's, like, there's there would potentially be name like, I feel like we part of me really wants to say let's go figure out a a surefire way to link this stuff every single time for every single quote for every single sale does like none of this matching name, email phone number stuff, like I'm open to anything to get this stuff 100% matched

Unknown Speaker  10:27
so well the real thing is

Matthias Miller  10:35
from an opportunity have a create quote option that feeds the opportunity ID individualizing the visualizer memorizes it until it saves

Speaker 2  10:52
Well, what does that mean? Like I understood I understood conceptually what you said but what talk to me about what that would mean to make that work.

Matthias Miller  11:02
Okay, so when a salesperson does not once a critic work, they pull it the CRM

Unknown Speaker  11:09
will be opportunity and say New quote Yeah,

Speaker 2  11:14
yeah, I mean, I understood that part but the whole part about the configurator memorizing part is where where I was

Matthias Miller  11:23
then when the configurator creates a sales order it stops in the opportunity ID

Unknown Speaker  11:27
but I mean what is that going to take from Josh and the configurator

Unknown Speaker  11:33
it's it's not I mean, it's not it's an hour of his time Max okay. I could be wrong I've been wrong

Matthias Miller  11:50
once I thought I was wrong that wasn't

Unknown Speaker  11:59
that was the only time but if you just go into dealer portal and dealer whiskey

Matthias Miller  12:10
apart from that, and start from scratch from there, it won't like

Unknown Speaker  12:21
see, what would

Speaker 2  12:21
be really really cool is when when you go to let's say you went straight to the Configurator you configure it up a building you go to the end you hit Confirm sale or confirmed quote or whatever, whatever any of those points. A pop up says hey, these these leads right here think we think might be actually the person you're talking about? Yes, like if it's like there they are pick one or pick no

Speaker 2  13:00
imagine that could get up noxious though. I don't know. I think I'm worrying about something that I just need to not be worrying about. I don't know

Matthias Miller  13:09
Well, I am I am interested in making attribution more thorough

Speaker 2  13:17
for sure, ideally, if we can get if we can get attributes, if we can quantify bliss from our side tell Google this customer turned into a sale then we can better get Google to give us more people like that Right? Correct. So I feel like they're the push to actually get good quantifiable information like this is okay, not okay back up. Let's back up is some of this is some of this is going to go away once we start using either one of these one of these 3d

Unknown Speaker  13:50
platforms? Why?

Speaker 2  13:54
Well, because in order to actually go get in there and you know, save a quote, you're gonna have to give us real information.

Unknown Speaker  14:02
You still have to people still have multiple email addresses

Speaker 1  14:12
doesn't fix the flow problem. So can we do was Floyd and RTO blades as well as Floyd's and RTO. As he send them? No was his sale? Oh, no, I

Unknown Speaker  14:33
don't think so. I don't think it was, I think was the cash sale.

Speaker 2  14:45
Actually, let me go see, I think I can tell you what the name of this customer was.

Unknown Speaker  14:52
This over here.

Speaker 2  14:57
And maybe maybe this doesn't happen as much As I feel like it's happening, of maybe it does.

Matthias Miller  15:04
But with dealers, it's hard to tell. Okay, here's the other thing we can do.

Speaker 1  15:09
If there's any way we can email them, if there's any way we can get them, get them to click a link on that same device, then we can track them.

Unknown Speaker  15:23
Okay, tell me what you mean. If we, if so you're saying the actual device they originally put the lead in on? Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  15:38
Well, that's,

Unknown Speaker  15:39
that's going to be as hit or miss is our current system. They send it in on a computer, they click it on a phone like.

Speaker 2  15:57
I mean, ideally, ideally, like, part of me wants to say, like, I would, I would love, like, you can't get into the configurator, unless you came through an opportunity. That's the only way you can get to these things. That would be sweet. But he talked about being a bit obnoxious?

Unknown Speaker  16:18
Well, you just make it easier to create an opportunity.

Speaker 2  16:29
I don't know, you know, what I want, I'm gonna, I have a feeling if I if I let you stew on this long enough, you're going to come up with a really cool way.

Matthias Miller  16:38
I don't know that I will. I mean,

Unknown Speaker  16:42
I want my data vendor

Matthias Miller  16:45
to be able to link multiple email addresses back to the same consumer ID but

Speaker 1  16:49
I couldn't have been able to talk him into it.

Unknown Speaker  17:12
I mean,

Speaker 2  17:13
would it would it? Would it make more sense to build some kind of report that

Unknown Speaker  17:23
you know, you know,

Speaker 2  17:26
here's, here's sales, here's, here's, here's sales for, you know, this district, and you pull it up, and it goes, you know, you click the line item, and it goes and searches all the contact records and say, it's possible this one, this one, this one, this one, and, you know, and then have a way to link them to the two together and just make it a manual process?

Speaker 1  17:45
Maybe Why not be the worst thing for the last 20%? I mean, because at this rate,

Speaker 2  17:54
I could have Addison open this up every single day, and go, you know, here's the sales that aren't linked. And obviously, there's going to be a number of of the sales that, you know, we're just walk ons and they're never going to have Wait a minute. Wait, okay. It would seem like, okay, riddle me this, it would seem like we should be able to require the dealer to say, when they're creating a quote, or a sale, how did this customer get here? And it would be a prompt that's required, you have to say, Hey, Mr. Customer, how did you come to us? If they say, Well, I clicked on your you no online lead? Well, that would automatically if we stored that in assist could then say go find leads that match for this customer?

Unknown Speaker  18:47
Right. Well,

Matthias Miller  18:50
I mean, that's a matter of just adding a field going, Josh, with the options or having Josh added getting getting the dealers and districts on board. And but if you say this is for the sake of Google attribution you've got when you got district managers on board, for sure.

Speaker 2  19:06
Well, yeah, because I think I think the moment we we integrate with any of these 3d platforms, I think I'm going to want to try and push Ohio to start bringing in leads directly. And then we're going to talk about attribution on that side as well. So

Matthias Miller  19:35
why am I the one who's leading them to attribution?

Unknown Speaker  19:38
Sorry. Well, I don't know what you're doing. I don't know what

Speaker 2  19:45
I have no idea if if they like, give fierce a list of sales and they go through this man and I don't know.

Matthias Miller  19:52
Who knows. I don't know. Well, one of the I'll shut up here.

Speaker 2  19:56
I just know they're killing us in sales. So they must be doing something right

Matthias Miller  20:00
They are doing something right. Hey, sidenote, the whole budget versus appearance and quality question on the lead form.

Unknown Speaker  20:07
What are you talking about what

Matthias Miller  20:10
wait for the call tomorrow, but we asked people whether buying based on price or appearance quality and Indiana's 1995 Shed

Unknown Speaker  20:23
has got some interesting interesting hooks.

Speaker 2  20:29
So you're getting a lot more hits on the budget side.

Matthias Miller  20:34
Well, in North Carolina people aren't returning calls on the budget side from what limited we've seen. Okay, and the people in quality and appearance are which in my mind that's been the two point value proposition from day one.

Speaker 2  20:48
But what's what's the what's your point on the on the Indiana 1996 Shit?

Matthias Miller  20:54
Well, even the Mercer which we're offering if we can offer a stripped down bottom price for whatever we're happy to build and sell it for, like Wayne was saying, Wayne or Floyd I don't know which saying yeah they got this 9095 Their shaker shed or whatever it is oh yeah and and like they get people in the lot for the small eat at that another said they want to buy it was oh no who was I don't remember who was who was telling about it. This girl came in who had a $2,000 budget and she was just beside herself getting that she found this exactly what she was looking for thing and then there's others are like I can never fit my stuff into that I need something bigger so starting the conversation low and then upselling them from there where they they don't immediately close the door because the bottom bottom price shed is still an option. I don't know if it's an avenue we want to go but it definitely the different buying persona

Unknown Speaker  21:55
Oh, yeah.

Matthias Miller  21:58
Okay, so for if the SEO is not canceled if it has a building, it's not a quote. It's not a move. Site check remove request.

Speaker 2  22:07
The whole site check move requesting you can ignore now. Okay. Because site check move requests is no longer Whoa, okay. Hold on. Sorry. Backup. No, sorry. On the sales order side. We were like on the sales order side. We are still using it. So no, I'm sorry. You are correct.

Unknown Speaker  22:23
Oops. Sorry, my my bed

Unknown Speaker  22:35
Wait. Oh, hey, Darrell. Cannot talk to you right now.

Unknown Speaker  22:51
Do we need to exclude? Okay, so this is what I was doing on the Facebook side.

Unknown Speaker  23:00
FYI, sorry, I

Matthias Miller  23:02
need that. Let's

Unknown Speaker  23:03
finish this my brain swirling keep going?

Matthias Miller  23:06
Do we need to exclude wholesale and legacy?

Unknown Speaker  23:24
Who in wholesale

Unknown Speaker  23:24
would be valuable to know?

Unknown Speaker  23:30
On Facebook, we can.

Matthias Miller  23:31
And I don't know if it's actually going to do any good.

Unknown Speaker  23:34
I think it's valuable to exclude wholesale.

Unknown Speaker  23:38
So I will just

Matthias Miller  23:41
I don't know that this is necessary. But

Speaker 2  23:43
well, but you really should. So as hosts know that you're right. I'm sorry. You're right. Keep going. You're right.

Unknown Speaker  23:53
No, it's also just to the district two while we're at it.

Matthias Miller  24:00
Okay. And so here we're also building for FB kids, which is like the Google identifiers but on Facebook, they don't look for Google identifiers. They just you just pass in PII personally identifiable information they match it up. So

Unknown Speaker  24:19
okay, this looks right to you though. I'm not sure what I'm looking for.

Matthias Miller  24:25
I don't know the right subset.

Speaker 2  24:29
So you're looking for you're looking for sales based on district. Wait a minute, why are you Why wouldn't be passing quote information?

Unknown Speaker  24:43
At what value

Matthias Miller  24:45
because it should not be the value of our sale.

Speaker 2  24:47
Customer gave us information. Oh, well, I mean, yeah, but I mean that the quote the quote has a value in the event.

Matthias Miller  24:54
You would have an event a different event. Let me ask him about that.

Unknown Speaker  24:59
Um, Jonathan's

Speaker 2  25:02
backing up so this this thing is grabbing information based on purchase and feeding that information into Google and saying go find more people like is that right? That's the goal. So why wouldn't be passing quoted like a different type of event, it was a quote, so it didn't turn. But that's not necessarily true. Because there's a number of there's a number of people in there that have multiple quotes that then became a sale. I don't know if that's a value or not.

Unknown Speaker  25:34
Well,

Matthias Miller  25:38
I mean, ultimately, though, if they didn't convert to a sale, we don't really want more people like that. Do we?

Unknown Speaker  25:46
Well, they took the time to actually talk to us,

Unknown Speaker  25:51
potentially, but

Matthias Miller  25:53
their value should not be the quote, the value should be something like 100 bucks or 250 bucks or something.

Speaker 2  26:05
Is there a right? Is there a way to tell Google to rate them? Like people who turned into a sale obviously it's 100%. But if you only did a quote and you're a 50%

Matthias Miller  26:18
Well, I mean, the sale will rate them at 100%

Unknown Speaker  26:22
I don't know this is a thought.

Unknown Speaker  26:40
Okay, but apart from that, what's the switch right?

Matthias Miller  26:46
If they click multiple links, we just distribute the each click

Unknown Speaker  26:51
attributed to third. Yeah. We've actually had people fill

Matthias Miller  26:56
out the type form after No, yeah, no clicking Add. You've had people clicking Add after they've talked to you after they fill out the type form

Unknown Speaker  27:07
possibly even after talking to a dealer, so Okay, good. Well, that takes care of that one lot. Oh, I had another one. Phone menu for Nick. Um, sound menu for Nick. What? Okay,

Matthias Miller  27:29
lot building macro for the sales breakdown record report.

Unknown Speaker  27:33
Yeah, so here's

Speaker 2  27:35
here's the deal when a building gets sold the the checkbox for for lot is unchecked. Essentially what I want to go I want a macro that searches modification history for any building that has its that had it's like a fairly recent record that the lot the building for a lot was unchecked and became a sale is essentially what I want to do and I want to put it on the the sales curve breakdown report so that we can quantify ugly identify offline sales.

Speaker 1  28:14
Does that make sense? I think so. So it is building for lot now. Is it's not

Speaker 2  28:25
so if it's checked building for lot it's it's sitting on the lot. It's a lot building. Okay. So in modification history, a building that is tied to a sales order that's a sale and in its modification history, it was a was building for a lot and now no longer Well, I guess it should be a building that was tied to that that's tied to a sale that was I think you understand what I'm trying to say I don't feel like I'm saying it very well

Speaker 2  29:01
it's just that the whole the evaluation is going to be on this like the macro is going to sit on the sales order side but needs to evaluate the building lot or the building modification history

Speaker 2  29:25
and then, and then I want to turn it in also probably want to make some sort of simplistic standalone report. This needs to become these become standard but the standalone report could be well once you have this I can go build my own standalone report.

Unknown Speaker  29:41
Because once you have the macro then it just it will let's see. So let's do anything that not building for lat and so field going so afield not not so is canceled and not so

Matthias Miller  30:12
yeah or not isn't as of sale date

Unknown Speaker  30:16
I don't know which one

Unknown Speaker  30:19
you got some redundancy there but fine

Speaker 1  30:23
well I mean is in that so is that better

Speaker 2  30:27
yeah I don't know if I necessarily want to refine for so sale date I mean technically yes that's fine put it in there there are times that would actually exclude some stuff sometimes we use the no sale date thing for to keep it off other reports but that's fine you can drop it in

Speaker 1  30:56
you guys aren't building boats what can you have a real SOCl date

Speaker 2  31:09
you must be getting old your humor is becoming deadpan.

Unknown Speaker  31:44
Oh well yeah

Unknown Speaker  31:54
oh no, there we go

Speaker 2  31:59
no, that's that's fine. Can we get let's let me let me see what are you evaluating on the like are you on the billing side of the sales order side or you're you're on the building side

Unknown Speaker  32:10
do you want it on the sales order side

Unknown Speaker  32:14
it's gonna need to be on the sales order side it's gonna be on the sales current breakdown

Unknown Speaker  32:46
Do you want this to be so building

Matthias Miller  32:47
was a lot of just building was a lot to do with that deal with

Speaker 2  32:54
so building so that we know that's on the sales order side does the macro care if the macro will care I mean

Matthias Miller  33:05
yeah I mean if we do this then we should do

Unknown Speaker  33:06
yeah

Unknown Speaker  33:40
sales order might be a little better here

Unknown Speaker  33:53
let's just do this building so Id

Unknown Speaker  33:56
when you will you can drop the so building standard as well

Unknown Speaker  34:06
to run

Unknown Speaker  34:23
Wait, why

Speaker 2  34:28
go all the way to the top Why was there an MC number in here and GMA numbers but let me see that did you do we refund for billing as district gets

Unknown Speaker  34:40
new CP? That would probably be

Speaker 2  34:42
our or actually no evaluate let's evaluate for dealer is in network. So I think it's so dealer or something in network I think actually, I think you need to go from you need to you need to link yeah there you go

Unknown Speaker  35:09
interesting

Speaker 2  35:11
and so you guys still there but whatever yeah what is that thing

Unknown Speaker  35:21
whatever

Unknown Speaker  35:31
yeah yeah Now we're cooking with gas

Unknown Speaker  35:34
let's reverse now see the recent ones

Matthias Miller  35:38
okay so here's one ginger

Unknown Speaker  35:48
Nicole

Speaker 2  35:52
so link across that's going across the building and this just lets you look at modification history to make sure that we're doing the right thing

Unknown Speaker  36:02
yep Sure enough

Unknown Speaker  36:03
yes to know that was a lot building perfect

Unknown Speaker  36:08
that is the kind of injuries okay so where do you want this thing

Unknown Speaker  36:15
put it

Unknown Speaker  36:17
put it

Unknown Speaker  36:20
Oh good grief where do I want to put this thing is there a

Unknown Speaker  36:24
print sales reports down down at their wounds

Speaker 1  36:37
like this sure that's fine what

Speaker 2  36:43
can you then spec you can go and save that can you then spec to get that to replace and the in the standard report there is already a and the sales the sales curve break down thingamajigger

Unknown Speaker  37:02
you're gonna have to go to the standard folder for it yeah the breakdown details over there

Speaker 2  37:15
that by car it says awful lot there that it only means like I want to replace whatever he did in that column with that

Unknown Speaker  37:21
macro going through a lot but what if it is still true? Does that matter?

Speaker 2  37:34
Well that was back in week one that it was sold through the configurator it will not be true

Unknown Speaker  37:48
I mean if you want to just leave it there and add another column for it I don't care

Matthias Miller  37:52
I mean can we just do if if the building building for lot yeah it's not a lot but it was for a lot

Unknown Speaker  37:59
I'm sorry saying no more time can we just do if here let's just do this

Matthias Miller  38:08
this is the fastest way to get things done. Nick is very deep and other stuff so if you got a few minutes we can Yeah.

Matthias Miller  39:18
Wait Is there anywhere else that this needs to be changed

Speaker 1  39:23
what do you mean we're we're using building for lot Ah thanks

Speaker 2  39:37
there anything else is user reports I'm probably going to drop it into

Unknown Speaker  39:42
but should we make this be S O building? So is lab sale Sure.

Unknown Speaker  39:50
Whatever you so wish

Unknown Speaker  39:58
I think that's better.

Unknown Speaker  40:15
So in this case it would be

Unknown Speaker  40:45
really for lack or

Unknown Speaker  41:02
guess a lot of wants to do this

Unknown Speaker  41:35
so what would

Speaker 2  41:36
be the faster way to actually do is have Josh field this somewhere

Unknown Speaker  41:39
like

Speaker 2  41:43
this is gonna obviously slow down the report significant is not gonna be terrible yeah that's not great either. Does that does the subscriber has the subset pre filter before the macro hits? Or does that does that catch beforehand?

Matthias Miller  41:57
Yeah, it does. It'll start loading rows in a load load slow.

Unknown Speaker  42:02
Yeah, um

Matthias Miller  42:04
I do wonder though whether we should rather than just jury rigging this

Unknown Speaker  42:09
we should ask Josh if there's a way that we could

Unknown Speaker  42:17
do this.

Matthias Miller  42:19
Why did you start sending the boolean to false? Why did you start sending a boolean to false or the fuel to false billing for lunch?

Unknown Speaker  42:28
Why does it happen? Yeah,

Speaker 2  42:32
well the that checkbox actually governs whether it shows up in lot building reports

Speaker 2  42:39
so basically if it's if it's if it's checked for lot and the last known our locations our G line is a dealership it shows up in their report so I mean it's it's the governor for for lot building reports. So as soon as as soon as you uncheck that, it means it's a sale which means it goes falls out of their inventory

Matthias Miller  43:02
Why would you change your inventory to exclude sold built lot buildings?

Speaker 2  43:06
Well, I'm sure there's, I'm sure there's a number of different ways we can slice this pie. It's just where we're currently at. I'm open to ideas I mean, whatever I would be open to you know coming up with a better way Is it is it you know,

Unknown Speaker  43:24
I don't know

Matthias Miller  43:28
not too excited about this approach. It just seems really messy to be putting this in the court system

Speaker 2  43:34
well I'm like I said I'm open to

Unknown Speaker  43:39
let's try this and I don't know what

Speaker 2  43:43
Now that being said we could we could keep it out of the court system and just leave it like we could build user lot building reports and say you know when when district manager says hey, I want to know what my sales versus my lat sales were, we can do it as just a users thing but then it's still there's still mess going on

Speaker 1  44:16
when does this get set? For a lot yeah,

Speaker 2  44:21
for lot gets Josh made a little tool based on I think it's building configurations that if you click it, it automatically creates a building record for on that configuration that you can turn into a lot building which automatically checks the building for lot. That being said, I mean, there's buildings that get created off of other buildings that so the common the common theme has been recently is where a district manager will say such and such a lot. There was these buildings on there go look at those and take those buildings and create new lot buildings for this new lot. Check. When you do that you check before lot.

Matthias Miller  44:58
What if we could we You just have a field called building built for lot. And at the time of build, we just memorize that checkbox.

Speaker 2  45:06
You This is a you and Josh thing. I'm I'm not, I'm not overly, I don't have a dog really in this fight. Ideally what I want, what I want to know is I want to be able to build I want to I want reports that I can look we can look down across and see buildings that were built and they were sales and buildings that were sold off of the lot and some of this is just well and then it also turns into this conversation about you know, turn rates and there's a whole there's a whole bunch of reasons we want to know this

Matthias Miller  45:41
but why couldn't you just look at the locations or G and see if it was on the lot at the time of sale?

Unknown Speaker  46:03
Why

Speaker 2  46:04
couldn't you look at the Lokar G and see if it was on the what how's that? How's that better than what you're then evaluating modification history does that more surefire

Matthias Miller  46:15
a lot faster? A lot faster. I don't know how accurate your information is but

Speaker 1  46:20
I mean, you know, where's your locations or G

Unknown Speaker  46:25
right it's come left come left for either

Speaker 1  46:29
so if the latest is that virtual No. If the if the

Speaker 2  46:39
if the former was if the former Loctite was dealer and it you can't match up necessarily from like the Lokar G and the sales are won't always match if let's say a dealer sells off of another dealers lock well it doesn't matter

Matthias Miller  46:55
if the dealer is the same but was it on a dealer lot So it'd be building so field

Speaker 1  47:06
latest RG this building Lok type equals Daler for the loop type equals dealer where building load completed date is less than v so sale date and

Unknown Speaker  47:39
dealer billing mode type as building oh so you'll network better so building was lot

Speaker 2  47:50
so basically you're targeting targeting a very short RG versus a very long RG

Matthias Miller  47:56
you're not going through activity history you're staying on the same record. Gotcha. Now these are saying that's not the case. So So sale date here was for 19

Unknown Speaker  48:09
This one was

Matthias Miller  48:11
doesn't have a location because it's not

Unknown Speaker  48:13
built yet I guess you could exclude for blanks obvious boy well I mean

Matthias Miller  48:24
this one said it was it used to be for live

Speaker 2  48:27
yeah okay But hang on a second every every builder is considered a dealer so every eventually you're going to say it was

Speaker 1  48:37
all wait what did you say? It was

Matthias Miller  48:43
okay the activity history says this one I don't know

Speaker 1  48:45
where it was where was this one this one we go into activity history

Unknown Speaker  48:57
oh

Speaker 2  48:58
about promise you this one was a copy off of wellness Sally

Unknown Speaker  49:02
wait what No. Go back to modification

Unknown Speaker  49:05
history and type in

Matthias Miller  49:06
SORRY SORRY SORRY SORRY hang on I next a subset that was done

Unknown Speaker  49:18
what did I do with my so is lat sale Okay, these are all okay let's go down to here's one we said it was a lot sale. Sold and 11 322 it was delivered on the date of the sale

Unknown Speaker  49:55
Well,

Speaker 2  49:56
no, it was it was Wow. Okay, that's a very bad that's a Very bad. Well, okay, you're that or I thought you were excluding for way to go exclude for wholesale exclude for dealer is it? Well, it's good for the sales are being wholesale

Speaker 1  50:22
Okay, they're the now there's a few nodes in here. Here's a recent one. This one Henry got from lot 120. So we sold it on a third not. It's not though. Wait, wait, wait, wait didn't hit the modification you didn't.

Unknown Speaker  50:46
You're saying it was lot and then not.

Unknown Speaker  50:50
This one said

Matthias Miller  50:52
on the third it was it did not become a lot Billy. It was an unbuilt lat building

Unknown Speaker  50:58
is what it appears to me.

Speaker 2  51:00
Gotcha. All right, go grab a different one we keep coming up with feels like outliers. Grab another random one.

Speaker 1  51:09
I mean, a no one, or whatever, that one actually would work. 114 22? Yeah, that's a good that's.

Matthias Miller  51:19
Once again, they delivered it on the day of sale. So should we just say that, if it was on the lot before the day that you sold it?

Speaker 2  51:27
Oh, man, this this, this feels very hit or miss, like quantifying history is is solid. The other way is not part of me wants to say if we want to do this, right and evaluate on the same record, we come up with another. I don't know. Maybe we stored somewhere stored as a hidden field or something?

Matthias Miller  51:51
I mean, can we just say if it was? No, because if you sell it you could still sell it before it's built. So it's not, it might not be a lot building as of the time it was built.

Matthias Miller  52:10
I mean, the simple thing is, whenever we set that thing to false, we set something else to true, right?

Speaker 2  52:19
Make a hidden field that called was lat building. When that one goes to false, the other one goes to true. I'm making things up now. Whatever you whatever you want to do. I mean, it doesn't have to be it doesn't have to be a visible field. I mean, it's basically we're just trying to we're just trying to quantify this. I'll take it to Josh and see what his thoughts are. He might have a better way. Or worse by I don't know. I don't necessarily have a strong opinion how you do it. I just it needs to be surefire, so that we're you know, if you're going to try to evaluate on a complex amount of information based on the sale, there's too many variables that can go wrong.

Matthias Miller  53:06
Opportunity communication, record B to pain to see both the list in the communication. Okay,

Speaker 2  53:11
on the opportunity, Nick put this like communication record at the bottom? Can that thing be to pain so that if you click that the communication that shows up the communication on the right hand side of

Speaker 1  53:21
it? I have no idea what you're talking about. All right, grab an opportunity or an opportunity. Down at the bottom this one? Yeah,

Speaker 2  53:30
yeah, you select the row that the other half of it becomes the communication.

Matthias Miller  53:35
No, my plan once we consolidate is that we do it that we do a three pain left one is the opportunity middle one is a communications report. And the one on the right is a new communication plan communication record.

Speaker 2  53:49
I'd be fine with that too. Here's here's here's what I want to chase. I had this idea rolling around in my head to come up with essentially a multi pane report that divides your leads based on

Unknown Speaker  54:04
weight click Edit on that

Matthias Miller  54:09
whether we say no we need to talk about opportunity status or you need to figure it out.

Speaker 2  54:14
The opportunity status thing I would love to see that become a manual thing. And like all your like we create a multi pane report that the left pane is your new stuff. Like you update the status to say quoted it moves over into the next pane. Kind of like what traditional

Matthias Miller  54:31
like a pipeline type of thing. Yeah. Well, do you want to get your head together with me some time to

Unknown Speaker  54:39
come up with a proposal for what the

Matthias Miller  54:41
statuses should be and well actually I have statuses

Unknown Speaker  54:45
sales team wants to

Matthias Miller  54:47
know I mean, the sales team wants three or four categories one new lead haven't talked to them warmly. I'm working with them. hot lead, rated by Marissa wants a number four which is is a,

Unknown Speaker  55:01
this is a

Matthias Miller  55:04
she wants hot lead, this is a shed hot lead, this is a tiny home shell, and your tiny home shells have much longer

Unknown Speaker  55:11
status. Like not not? Wow, maybe

Speaker 2  55:18
you go with tags? I mean, that's a that's a fairly common thing. Okay. Okay, again, how do you how do they want to use it, then? That's that's the big question. Like, in my head, I kind of like to go with the like, a lot of CRMs they like they have like you have your your pipeline columns like, you know, you kind of move them over to to the right hand side, which eventually you end up in a one status or something like that. It's kind of what I was chasing. But I don't know, I'm, I'm just here's, here's what kind of here's what I think is happening on a bunch of the dealers is when all of your your leads are kind of going from top to bottom is your brain automatically says what's most important is at the top of the list. So it's like, it's like dividing up that list in columns so that you have a lot of stuff at the top as you were as you're working your leads.

Matthias Miller  56:16
Well, and the other thing we need is we need the most important things to be at the top and

Unknown Speaker  56:19
to be visible. So

Matthias Miller  56:24
shut up versus 3d other guy, if shut out doesn't have an API. We can't use it.

Unknown Speaker  56:31
Yeah, agreed. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  56:34
That was easy. How do

Unknown Speaker  56:36
they not have an API?

Unknown Speaker  56:38
Like? It's a little bit

Speaker 2  56:41
mind bending to me. I guess. I guess it they're expecting a complete ecosystem, I guess it would make sense. They don't really have an API. But then again, like, seriously, you're not automating anything out to anything else? Nothing outside, that's

Unknown Speaker  56:56
all.

Matthias Miller  56:58
Or they're doing it all manually internally. Can I leave that uncomfortable with using the 3d essay?

Unknown Speaker  57:06
And

Matthias Miller  57:08
I think they seem to be quite workable in accommodating whatever things we need. Do you want to? Is that the direction you want to go? Do you I'm gonna communicate that to Eric, do you wanna communicate to Eric?

Speaker 2  57:22
I don't care. Either one. I can do it. You can do it. I don't. I don't care. I mean, I'm probably going to tell him hey, you know, you kind of came in on the back end of a conversation we just wanted to make it was kind of like a, I wanted to see, we wanted to see what you rephrase. I wasn't even aware they had a 3d visualizer. So I didn't even give them a second thought. I hate the fact that, you know, we find that they have a 3d visualizer. Well, then they don't have an API. So you're kind of out of the running anyway. So because whatever we're using, we want to use predominantly as a quote tool, because we've got this whole the back end software, and we're not going away from that. So sorry. Yeah. I'm just really surprised that, but but then again, I saw somewhere like when he was, Are you sure they don't have an API? Because I saw something in one of this. Like, as he was going through, I saw something referencing an API.

Matthias Miller  58:18
I mean, they have integrations with Google, Google and some Google stuff. And I don't know.

Speaker 2  58:26
I mean, I guess if they don't have an open API, what's I imagine they have some way to link out and stuff. They just don't have an open way to call it is that what there's like, I don't understand the difference between an API and an open API.

Matthias Miller  58:38
I don't know either. I mean, the other option is giving him a couple days to come back to us with with answers to our questions,

Unknown Speaker  58:44
if you prefer, I don't know.

Unknown Speaker  58:46
Well, I feel like I'm been stalling this thing.

Unknown Speaker  58:49
Okay. Well, I think

Matthias Miller  58:57
I'm happy if you want to shoot him an email and just let him know, say, hey, look, the API ends up being a deal breaker, because we have to integrate with the back end system. At this point, we're looking to move on with the other one.

Unknown Speaker  59:10
Yeah, I can do that.

Unknown Speaker  59:16
There's one other thing

Matthias Miller  59:19
I really need to drop off I've got another call I want to get on the

Speaker 1  59:27
phone menu. Sound many purchase orders and skew lots to the phone menu. Purchases this urge.

Matthias Miller  59:39
guessing it's a mark thing

Speaker 2  59:41
as Okay, so purchase orders and SKU lots. There's no exports for any of these right now. An export would have to be built for the purchase order export. Imagine some type of export for the SKU lot, which then would turn into some type of report which would then be tied off to I guess the phone menu is what we're chasing

Matthias Miller  1:00:03
I don't know I don't have time to chase this let me see if he's I really got to drop Let me see how urgent is and if it's necessary I'll get with him we can wait until next week maybe you and I can take a look at it next week

Unknown Speaker  1:00:16
what's what was his question? I was what was this question

Matthias Miller  1:00:21
like it's not generating any output and he's got trouble integrating with the Ask

Unknown Speaker  1:00:24
prompts or something.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:28
You mean the records not?

Matthias Miller  1:00:31
Let me just LCC you on the on the email here. Okay. You want me to awesome

Speaker 2  1:00:38
if I if you see if you send it over to me, do you want me to reach out and tell him what what what what we're thinking or, or wait till next week?

Matthias Miller  1:00:45
I think I think probably wait till next week rather than interrupt him but unless it's urgent.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:51
Okay. Appreciate it.
