Unknown Speaker  00:32
Hi, Matthias, how are you? Hey, I'm well. How are you? I'm well, good,

Unknown Speaker  00:39
great to Great

Unknown Speaker  00:41
to meet you. Yeah, great to meet you, too. Thanks for all the I just want to before we get started. Thanks for all the work that you've done. I really, really appreciate it. So you're welcome. Thank you.

Unknown Speaker  00:55
So let me just walk you through a little bit kind of the business. And

Unknown Speaker  01:04
and then let's, I think the easiest place or an interesting place to start could just be,

Unknown Speaker  01:14
wait a minute, here we

Unknown Speaker  01:18
go.

Unknown Speaker  01:20
Let's just pull up one of the palettes that they make, and

Unknown Speaker  01:25
you can maybe see, I'm trying to think of a good that's a great

Unknown Speaker  01:32
let's try one of these New Holland ones. I

Unknown Speaker  01:35
mean, here's here's one. So there are a manufacturer they make shipping crates and containers,

Unknown Speaker  01:44
yeah, and so, I mean, like, here's, here's just one of their handwritten designs. Or, like, yeah, one of their prints. And

Unknown Speaker  01:56
you can see the 3d rendering

Unknown Speaker  02:01
all the, you know, the carriage bolts and

Unknown Speaker  02:04
different insets that

Unknown Speaker  02:06
just all the everything, everything around how to build

Unknown Speaker  02:11
it. And so if we actually go,

Unknown Speaker  02:15
see which

Unknown Speaker  02:19
we can actually go. So then we have, so there's a few I'm

Unknown Speaker  02:26
going to go to the item definition, just to show this correlation. But

Unknown Speaker  02:31
you can see here, then there's a there's a cross reference between, you know, three and a half by six by 134,

Unknown Speaker  02:39
that's here, three and a half by three and a half by 134

Unknown Speaker  02:45
that's that one here.

Unknown Speaker  02:49
One in 1316, three and a half, 34 134 that one there. And so we the item definition has all of the information on how to make the palette

Unknown Speaker  03:03
all of the

Unknown Speaker  03:05
I don't know how familiar you are with with pallet manufacturing or just general saw mill operations.

Unknown Speaker  03:13
I'm not particularly, not particularly a lot, but I think I know some of the terminology, because I used to be interested in Guitar Lou theory,

Unknown Speaker  03:26
and I learned some things while researching those things. Yeah, so I'm familiar with words like can't, can't, dimensional lumber and things like that.

Unknown Speaker  03:39
Interesting. Great. So I mean, most of the most of the lumber is low grade lumber. I mean it's, what is it, low grade, hard hardwood,

Unknown Speaker  03:52
and so,

Unknown Speaker  03:54
yeah, most of the lumber that they get goes down through what's called a gangsaw, which is or gang saw or sizer to get it down, cut to the to the rough dimension, to the to the right

Unknown Speaker  04:08
external dimensions. And then gets, well, it just depends.

Unknown Speaker  04:14
And then a series of 10123,

Unknown Speaker  04:19
more saws to get it down to the exact you know, get it cut. Get it notched. I don't know if there's a there's a good example of a notched palette, but so are these automated saws.

Unknown Speaker  04:33
Most of them are. Yes, there's a few that are,

Unknown Speaker  04:39
there's a few that aren't, but

Unknown Speaker  04:41
most of them are automated saws. I mean, gang saws have, I mean, they've got huge teeth. I don't even know the size, but, you know, I don't know, just

Unknown Speaker  04:53
their massive teeth cutting from multiple directions. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  04:58
and so.

Unknown Speaker  05:00
So the first piece that we did was,

Unknown Speaker  05:05
there's a third party, I don't know if you're familiar with sage 100

Unknown Speaker  05:10
sage 100 is an ERP system they're using right now,

Unknown Speaker  05:15
accounting, I don't know what all and so the first step was importing sage orders from

Unknown Speaker  05:26
importing orders from Sage. And this is just basically a direct import from Sage. So these are their customers.

Unknown Speaker  05:36
And you know, there's a due date. We need this many pallets at this price, by this by this date,

Unknown Speaker  05:45
and the very first thing we did was a cut list. So

Unknown Speaker  05:49
the overall process is order comes in, it's assigned a due date. The all the, all the pieces get cut

Unknown Speaker  05:58
down to whatever, whatever is needed, and out of, out of

Unknown Speaker  06:04
sometimes, sometimes it changes, depending on what kind of lumber they have available.

Unknown Speaker  06:13
And then, once it's cut, the pallet is assembled, and they also have machines for assembly,

Unknown Speaker  06:22
most standard size pallets you can assemble on a machine.

Unknown Speaker  06:29
But then your oversized pallets, extra extra wide, extra long,

Unknown Speaker  06:37
those are hand assembled. And then also crates. They do crates. And so those

Unknown Speaker  06:45
that requires, that requires, I believe, hand assembly. I don't know if any part of that's on machine or not.

Unknown Speaker  06:55
And then some of the some of the pallets, are heat treated, so they basically load it into a semi trailer

Unknown Speaker  07:04
and with with heat treat it, and the heat treated heat it up to whatever

Unknown Speaker  07:09
is required, and then they load it up and ship it to the customer to take away the moisture, I'm guessing, take away The Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  07:20
and I don't know the exact beyond just taking away the moisture. I don't know the exact reason beyond,

Unknown Speaker  07:27
I think taking away the moisture makes it more stable. If you ship it in a with, if you ship it in a non dry state, it's more likely to bend or crack or something, Sure, okay? And, and for something like this, New Holland is a farm equipment manufacturer, okay? And so I'm going to guess, for some of these things, okay, like, if you're shipping, I don't know, bags of flour, that might not be a good, good example, but who cares what? Heat treating matters less. But if you have, if you have an engine, an engine or some other part,

Unknown Speaker  08:09
precision probably matters more. Heat treating and durability and weight might factor in. You might note better than I do,

Unknown Speaker  08:20
honestly. But,

Unknown Speaker  08:23
and then, and then it gets shipped off and, and so the first piece, then is,

Unknown Speaker  08:32
so we see new orders coming in,

Unknown Speaker  08:36
and like, here's a new order, here's a here's a new item that got ordered. So when you know that person, the person responsible for this, would have to come in and and set this up for

Unknown Speaker  08:52
whatever it is.

Unknown Speaker  08:56
I will note that they also sell kits. So basically a kit would just be the

Unknown Speaker  09:04
material, I mean, some form of like a crate. Maybe, maybe it's the

Unknown Speaker  09:11
maybe it's the X, the bottom, bottom, top and sides, but it's not actually assembled.

Unknown Speaker  09:18
Basically a DIY version of the product. That's right, correct.

Unknown Speaker  09:25
And so, you know, you'd have to go through and pull this out, and pull out the prints, and fill out all the details of what goes in and what happens to it, which we can get into a little bit more.

Unknown Speaker  09:38
And then, and then you can see here. And so he'll then say, he'll look at the due date and say, Well, okay, most of these remys are similar. And so this is what it would generate on the cut list. This is what needs to be cut. And you can see here that you know it needs to run on the sizers. One of these needs to run on the.

Unknown Speaker  10:00
Can tech, which is one of the other saws. They've got three different gang saws that they use, or sizes that they use,

Unknown Speaker  10:08
and and here's what we're here's can't that we're cutting out of, and here's how much that's the length that we need, here's the species we're using. And then they hit, send a cut list. And what happens then is that we've got two different cut lists. So there's basically, I mean, there's basically three teams in production. You have

Unknown Speaker  10:32
a team working on the gang saws, you have a team working on the the other

Unknown Speaker  10:38
saws.

Unknown Speaker  10:41
And you have a team on assembly, or, you know, I mean, it's multiple teams within that first, especially for assembly, but so the sizers cut list,

Unknown Speaker  10:53
you know, it's, it's grouped by, it's

Unknown Speaker  10:56
grouped by the sizer type. But he'll go through and say, All right,

Unknown Speaker  11:01
I'm gonna go ahead, and I want to go ahead and add these to the list, and then he'll generate a schedule, and we have a template export that

Unknown Speaker  11:14
shows the, let's

Unknown Speaker  11:17
see,

Unknown Speaker  11:19
I should Remember this better. This is the, this is the minimum yield, or this is the, this is the actual yield that we need. We're calculating 18% waste. So we should get about 1700 off the sizer.

Unknown Speaker  11:34
Okay, we need 87 cans

Unknown Speaker  11:38
to get that.

Unknown Speaker  11:41
Here's, here's the, here's that, here's some cutting instructions.

Unknown Speaker  11:47
Here's the yield size,

Unknown Speaker  11:51
miscellaneous nodes, etc, and so.

Unknown Speaker  11:55
And then the guys will, they'll go do this, and they'll say we were supposed to cut 700 100, or about 1700 we got, you know, 1750 and they'll write that in there for what they actually produced off of the gang saw.

Unknown Speaker  12:16
And then after that, those pieces would get sent over to sawing. And then the sawing schedule,

Unknown Speaker  12:25
it's very it's a lot of similarities, but there's a lot of differences too. So on the song schedule, all the saws are all put together in one list,

Unknown Speaker  12:37
and so like and then they're grouped by dimensions and

Unknown Speaker  12:43
so like, here's each of these. These are different lengths. These are same thickness and with different lengths. So these are all then get a cut on the cantek

Unknown Speaker  12:58
Boring notching bevels. You you know. So basically, is this basically a schedule? This is basically a schedule. It's basically a work order effectively, yeah, yeah, basically work order or schedule, yeah. And so they'll, they'll go through, they'll get these on a daily basis and and then put in what they completed that day. And then every morning, they pick one up from the office, right?

Unknown Speaker  13:29
And these are, these are stored as work order records.

Unknown Speaker  13:36
And so,

Unknown Speaker  13:39
I mean, it's, it's very basic information. It's like, what are we cutting? When do we need it cut by, what's the lumber size, some information. And then,

Unknown Speaker  13:53
or what's the yields, the yield dimensions.

Unknown Speaker  13:57
And then

Unknown Speaker  13:59
we'll store the actual, or, sorry, this is the, this is the expected yield,

Unknown Speaker  14:06
right? And then here's the and then we record the actual yield in here. Say, on this date we produced this many,

Unknown Speaker  14:15
which is this many board feet.

Unknown Speaker  14:20
And then these are

Unknown Speaker  14:24
the this ties back to a lumber row on the item,

Unknown Speaker  14:30
the lumber row that we're actually cutting.

Unknown Speaker  14:36
So

Unknown Speaker  14:38
and this is like quantity, quantity of the order and and multiplied by the quantity on the lumber row.

Unknown Speaker  14:48
This has evolved a lot. The Work Order record was never really intended to be used interactively all this much. I did want this stuff to be visible, but

Unknown Speaker  14:58
even I.

Unknown Speaker  15:00
This has gone through so many changes at this point that I don't know. I'm kind of, I should probably know better. Remember better

Unknown Speaker  15:10
some of these things, but it's we basically just push information onto it and then report off of,

Unknown Speaker  15:18
yeah, off of it here and in the template.

Unknown Speaker  15:24
And then just recently, so that that's the cut list that was, that was the first thing like before that, they had an Excel file that was supposed to

Unknown Speaker  15:32
generate the cut list. And it kind of works sometimes,

Unknown Speaker  15:37
but it wasn't very effective. I uh,

Unknown Speaker  15:43
and then let's do this. So then that's, that's the work order, and then they report back. And so each of the guys also get time sheets, each of the employees every day. And so right, Ben, here's how much. So he'll write down, okay, eight o'clock, I started on the DeWalt saw, and then, you know, 10 o'clock, I did. I was working on Timmy saw, and anyway, and then, and then at the end of the day, he'll say, and I quit at, you know, five o'clock, PM.

Unknown Speaker  16:17
And then here we enter time sheets, so you put in a date, and we use a dashboard, and so you've got the employees on the left. You can see here,

Unknown Speaker  16:31
you just put in, put in the saws and the start time, and then put in the end of day at the bottom.

Unknown Speaker  16:40
And we, we auto calculate breaks,

Unknown Speaker  16:44
the kind of

Unknown Speaker  16:46
like client school time guards, yeah, yep. We just, we just need to field things differently because of the, I don't know, just entry different environments, yep. And then we have a little bit of a report here.

Unknown Speaker  17:02
This one also needs to be updated. It's not super helpful, but it does show, like today, we showed 16 hours of thawing time, but we didn't report any board footage on the brewer.

Unknown Speaker  17:16
So that's weird.

Unknown Speaker  17:19
And here we have

Unknown Speaker  17:23
that's not helpful. I mean, the board footage varies so wildly. Gangsaws, I think would typically be fairly similar, but

Unknown Speaker  17:34
yeah.

Unknown Speaker  17:36
So then that gets us timesheets, and then we also enter the cut list yield. So he'll also come in here and say, what's the cut list? And he'll go in and enter, so if it was on a sizer, he says, How many cans did we use? And what was the yield cans, yield cans and yields? And he'll input that from the same printout that the guys got

Unknown Speaker  17:57
in the morning. So now with it, go ahead. So by yield, do we mean how many pallets we were able to make with the given number of cans? No, the yield in this case, from this from the sawing side, yield is the lumber yield. Oh, okay, okay.

Unknown Speaker  18:17
And so based off of this number of cans, we ran this many, can't see the size, or we yielded this much of the the lumber dimensions that we wanted out of that. Or

Unknown Speaker  18:30
if it's in a different if it's like, let's say, the the the

Unknown Speaker  18:38
can tech we, we we don't. We only track cans on the

Unknown Speaker  18:46
sizers, and so the cantek, we just look at what the yield was for. I

Unknown Speaker  18:53
mean, most of those are just,

Unknown Speaker  18:56
you've already sized it down. It's really just, well, we need to cut it in half, or we need to, I don't know, do a cutback, or, you know, cut off the end, or shorten it up, or split it, or, I don't know, so it's, it's not that meaningful. As far as you're not, we're not tracking, can't quantity. We're just tracking the yield on these other saws.

Unknown Speaker  19:18
So this transfer company, do they buy industrial cans, or do they saw the camps from their own number? I'm guessing they buy it from other people. They buy it from other people? Yeah, yeah, that makes more sense. Yep.

Unknown Speaker  19:37
So then those two pieces, we have

Unknown Speaker  19:42
Okay, can't also for the gang saws. This is, there's a lot of information, so I don't expect you to remember it all but, but gang saws are typically tracked by linear feet per hour.

Unknown Speaker  19:56
Most of the other saws, or the other saws, were tracking by board feet.

Unknown Speaker  20:00
Per hour.

Unknown Speaker  20:02
And so we then have a sawing analysis, because, because we can see the throughput on the saw, we have the time cards to see how much time was spent on the saw. And by that, we can get an analysis saying, we we process this many

Unknown Speaker  20:19
like, let's take a look at let's take a look at Keystone,

Unknown Speaker  20:25
or even the brewer. This is pretty interesting. Like on the 15th we process 10,000 linear feet per hour. Most of the other days we're running six or eight and so And here's one for 11,000

Unknown Speaker  20:39
I'm not super familiar with this, so it's not clear if they were also running the

Unknown Speaker  20:47
I mean, the bottom line is,

Unknown Speaker  20:49
you're operating at 60 to 80% of production capacity. Very likely.

Unknown Speaker  20:56
Can tech you can see,

Unknown Speaker  20:59
you know, you're going to see a lot more variability in these saws. Most likely, right? Because they're more specialized. They're more specialized. Smaller orders, more very or smaller volume, sometimes more variability. Yeah, right.

Unknown Speaker  21:16
Do they make anything other than pallets? Or that's it pallets and crates and then some shipping parts. But it's such a it's like, I don't know, one or 2% of their what they do? Oh, okay, so they don't make general carpentry. No, no. It's strictly pallets. Yes, strictly. And

Unknown Speaker  21:39
then on the assembly side,

Unknown Speaker  21:43
we have the assembly

Unknown Speaker  21:48
tracker. So every day there's printouts that go out that say we built

Unknown Speaker  21:58
these item codes. These are finished pallets. So for this finished pallet, we built this many. And so there's a guy that the assembly manager comes in and, you know, he says,

Unknown Speaker  22:15
okay, Steve worked from 1110, to 330, and

Unknown Speaker  22:22
I mean it, if everybody has the same time, it'll just copy the time down, because they're probably working as a team.

Unknown Speaker  22:30
This is, this is like the time card for assembly. And then, and then they assembled the iron scene, 221, here's the description. They did it by hand.

Unknown Speaker  22:42
This includes setup time. We estimate setup time for assembly

Unknown Speaker  22:49
and and then, in this case, they made 120

Unknown Speaker  22:54
mats and eight pallets.

Unknown Speaker  22:59
And so we'll enter assembly work orders on a daily basis. Let me see if I can find one here for you,

Unknown Speaker  23:10
sometimes and then and so you might have here's actually,

Unknown Speaker  23:20
Hang on.

Unknown Speaker  23:23
Let me see if I can find one here. This is a

Unknown Speaker  23:29
you're making the 501,

Unknown Speaker  23:36
yeah, this one.

Unknown Speaker  23:39
So on the 20th, these two guys made 20 pallets,

Unknown Speaker  23:46
but they didn't finish the order. And so on the 21st

Unknown Speaker  23:50
so David Levi made 20 and then Steven Julio made

Unknown Speaker  23:55
40 sides and 20 tops. And so they finished it on the second day.

Unknown Speaker  24:02
And so we say they made 20 pallets, and then we link those two work orders together.

Unknown Speaker  24:09
So they made 20 pallets for this stage order.

Unknown Speaker  24:13
And this was the work. This was this completes the work that Dave and Levi did in this, in this work order.

Unknown Speaker  24:25
The reason for doing that is that

Unknown Speaker  24:29
the only way we can tell assembly speed time, time spent in assembly is,

Unknown Speaker  24:37
I mean,

Unknown Speaker  24:39
if you guys work.

Unknown Speaker  24:42
These guys, these guys worked

Unknown Speaker  24:48
less than an hour,

Unknown Speaker  24:51
and these were

Unknown Speaker  24:55
13 out 13 hours. That doesn't look right. I.

Unknown Speaker  25:02
That is not look, right?

Unknown Speaker  25:08
There's no way they worked until 11:10pm,

Unknown Speaker  25:17
okay? The, it's

Unknown Speaker  25:19
a, it

Unknown Speaker  25:21
the

Unknown Speaker  25:22
it's if you could accurately say, Well, we're 10% complete. You could look at them independently. Or, you know, I made four pallets. But that's not how it works. And so we look at the total time and then attribute accordingly for our reporting.

Unknown Speaker  25:37
The fun thing is, and there's tracking warnings, we're trying to we're trying to we're trying to tie these out to sales orders. Make sure that all the sales orders get assembled and tied out to the work orders and and all that stuff. The

Unknown Speaker  25:50
Assembly Analysis Report is a pretty fun report,

Unknown Speaker  25:56
and this one is where we look at all the time, like, let's go. Let's group by, let's group by,

Unknown Speaker  26:11
let's group by, I don't even know,

Unknown Speaker  26:17
let's group by employee by month

Unknown Speaker  26:21
As an example,

Unknown Speaker  26:25
and it's not a super fast report,

Unknown Speaker  27:00
so I mean, Just as an example, let's take a look at how August and did.

Unknown Speaker  27:08
You can see, you can see the production value per hour worked. Now some of this stuff might be because he was working on the machine a lot in January of this year, or who knows what it was. I mean, this doesn't say everything, but, you know,

Unknown Speaker  27:28
it looks like July was a lot more efficient than June, for example.

Unknown Speaker  27:35
And so it's really interesting. It doesn't tell the full story, but it is interesting to start diving in and saying,

Unknown Speaker  27:44
what's our efficiency on? I mean, you can also do by assembly method, because that's pretty useful, too,

Unknown Speaker  27:53
and grouping by customer and so, what's the most? What are the most? What are the highest value customers? What are the lowest value customers,

Unknown Speaker  28:03
yeah,

Unknown Speaker  28:11
and then this, this report, is for they have an incentive program. And so

Unknown Speaker  28:17
there's a target, there's a target, labor cost that they have. So basically, if the guys work faster and they get bonuses,

Unknown Speaker  28:29
if they're under their target labor cost,

Unknown Speaker  28:33
like they work, they work a little bit faster, they get that money as a bonus

Unknown Speaker  28:37
their paycheck. So I'm

Unknown Speaker  28:40
um,

Unknown Speaker  28:44
any questions on any of

Unknown Speaker  28:48
um, I think I've learned a lot about the process, and

Unknown Speaker  28:53
thank you for the great explanations. Okay, you're welcome. Thankfully, we also you're already, you're also recording this, so I'll have access to it later. I hope. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  29:06
So

Unknown Speaker  29:07
besides all these, I noticed that one of the catalogs that we're using the Cutlass generator, it says auto generated by ISD. What is that? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  29:22
so John Allen put together a tool that it's a little bit of an experimental tool

Unknown Speaker  29:29
that actually lets us define records and lists and fields in invest,

Unknown Speaker  29:39
and then it gets exported. Okay, so I use this because for none of these things, I don't care about layout, like it's this type of layout is great. And so what this lets me do is I just, I just, really quickly, a lot of these are simple Records.

Unknown Speaker  30:00
And so it allows me to go ahead and create a database level, throw in some fields and fairly quickly generate the catalog for it. And I don't have to worry about positioning or if I want to move stuff around. You know that's

Unknown Speaker  30:15
and I have a Python script that there is a download catalog that exports this as a catalog file.

Unknown Speaker  30:27
But I have a Python script that watches for watches activity history sees when I change one of these things, automatically downloads it and

Unknown Speaker  30:38
and drops it in. So

Unknown Speaker  30:41
that's, I guess this hasn't been, I don't know if it has been actually, if it has been, actually, publicly unveiled, unveiled, because we, I don't think we've used this ISD thing. No, it's, it is something that seems like a prototyping tool. It is a prototyping tool. It really is. The plan was, at some point I wanted to use it whenever I was involved, just because I don't like spending time trying to fix layouts and things like that.

Unknown Speaker  31:17
And excuse me.

Unknown Speaker  31:21
And yes, it is a great prototyping tool, and the plan was long term. At some point, if I ever get my hands completely off of the catalog, then we'll just stop auto generating them and start editing the catalog and just treat it like a regular catalog. Oh, okay,

Unknown Speaker  31:44
yeah,

Unknown Speaker  31:47
that makes sense. I have one last question for you, and it's probably unrelated to any of this, so I know that you had a hand in making the web framework for using an invest Yeah. So one thing that perplexed me for a long time, and still does. What do the initials iisdf stand for?

Unknown Speaker  32:12
It's a class that we keep using to reference a lot of things.

Unknown Speaker  32:16
But I can't for the life of me, figure out what means

Unknown Speaker  32:22
I'm assuming it's invest something. Yeah, it is investor tools. Something, investor tools. That is a great question. I can't even remember.

Unknown Speaker  32:32
Man,

Unknown Speaker  32:43
am trying to remember.

Unknown Speaker  32:46
So I asked chat GPT, what could the initials mean? And it said, investor tools, internet software development framework. But I have a feeling that's not it. It's not a developed I don't think it's a I didn't think it was a framework,

Unknown Speaker  33:04
I stepped it was, I mean, the idea was a core internal library, like our version of jQuery, that was kind of the idea, yeah, how we Use it.

Unknown Speaker  33:18
But let's see when the origination date

Unknown Speaker  33:22
copybook compiler.

Unknown Speaker  33:28
This problem may be solved by the istef library. I've always called it is def so

Unknown Speaker  33:37
I don't have I'm on my Mac, so I have My I

Unknown Speaker  33:57
um, this is before it was created.

Unknown Speaker  34:01
Private.

Unknown Speaker  34:07
It would

Unknown Speaker  34:09
be so, I'll bet it was so. It was probably like 914,

Unknown Speaker  34:16
2005 to 1231, 2005 you have me curious now.

Unknown Speaker  34:22
I

Unknown Speaker  34:24
Let's see if it was in a file name. Do

Unknown Speaker  34:30
you have

Unknown Speaker  34:33
any idea? Did you check when some of the files were created to see if? But I couldn't find an elaboration for the the full form, I think investor tools. I think it's something like an investor tools, internal, standard development, no development framework does kind of ring.

Unknown Speaker  34:52
Let's try if we can do, let's see if we can do investor tools,

Unknown Speaker  34:58
internal. I.

Unknown Speaker  35:02
I

Unknown Speaker  35:04
guess script or software.

Unknown Speaker  35:18
Let's go to origination date would be, see

Unknown Speaker  35:28
that here's where we're using it. That is a great question, like, I literally cannot remember. I cannot remember. I'm pretty sure it was an investor, tools, internal something, okay, but I can't tell you more than that. It's a great question.

Unknown Speaker  35:47
Maybe I'll think of it in the next week or two. I was almost about to ask just but now I realize that this was long before working with you guys, so he probably wouldn't know. I think we also wanted something that

Unknown Speaker  36:05
was very unlikely, like, we weren't looking for a fancy name, like Comet, or, I don't know, some other, something that anybody else is likely to use, like, like, there's no, nobody would ever create a global variable called, called that.

Unknown Speaker  36:26
It's better than using the dollar sign that jQuery does exactly, exactly we we steered away from that. I

Unknown Speaker  36:37
did want to run through just a few more things. I would like to go a little deeper into the item definition itself, because I think that's a core part of the system that could be useful for making making sense of some of this stuff.

Unknown Speaker  36:50
We do track outside dimensions, which is the outside of the palette

Unknown Speaker  36:58
curve we talked about. We're not going to be using optimal curve going forward, we're going to pick a curve for pricing. And so if we use a more efficient can then,

Unknown Speaker  37:12
there we go.

Unknown Speaker  37:14
We do there's some pallets. Heat treating pallets are assembled the same way as non heat treating pallets. And so we do have the ability to assemble that we're only assembly tracking. So one field above confuses me a bit. So can you scroll? Scroll up? Yes. So I see that there's a field called Total board feet without curve. So isn't curve the loss due to sawdust.

Unknown Speaker  37:43
When we're sawing, we get some sawdust, and curve is we're calculating how much is lost to that. So shouldn't board feet without curve be higher than the other fields?

Unknown Speaker  37:56
No, because this is my understanding from the client. My understanding from the

Unknown Speaker  38:02
client is that the loss it includes the loss curve is

Unknown Speaker  38:08
your curve percentage, is the percentage of relative to the original, to the to the final yield.

Unknown Speaker  38:19
So if you yield one inch and you have a 16th inch, then

Unknown Speaker  38:24
it's 116 like your curve, percentage is 116

Unknown Speaker  38:32
and so The without curve,

Unknown Speaker  38:37
I guess, excluding curve, including curve.

Unknown Speaker  38:42
Okay? That makes sense.

Unknown Speaker  38:46
Yeah, that makes sense. Why it's the actually would be a better term to say including or excluding

Unknown Speaker  38:55
it on that because actually like that. I

Unknown Speaker  39:08
there, we do have stock items which we handle in assembly tracking, like we'll they'll make a bunch and then sell them. So basically, they keep pallets, the pallets themselves on inventory,

Unknown Speaker  39:24
sample, pallets, assembly methods. So the Vikings, if you actually search this online,

Unknown Speaker  39:34
you can see

Unknown Speaker  39:36
the Viking

Unknown Speaker  39:40
No, Viking 504, 504,

Unknown Speaker  39:43
palette.

Unknown Speaker  39:56
Bomberman online.

Unknown Speaker  40:00
So this is not the most modern one. Maybe they have, yeah, but I mean, this is, yeah, that's what that one

Unknown Speaker  40:10
is, and the other

Unknown Speaker  40:12
ones are. The woodpecker is like a hand,

Unknown Speaker  40:16
a hand machine, or single, single operator, small, single operator machine champion is a newer version of the Viking 504, I believe.

Unknown Speaker  40:27
Sorry, I was on the items

Unknown Speaker  40:34
we have. So then for each of these, you have the quantity of lumber, the quantity yield, the dimensions of the yield. There are sometimes, like, for the for the floor of the palette,

Unknown Speaker  40:47
they'll accept random width. So sometimes they'll want three and a half slat inch slats, like the whole way across. Sometimes they'll have random width, which is great for,

Unknown Speaker  41:00
let's say, I mean, it is just great to use up old lumber or miscellaneous lumber, so as long as it's more than three and less than five, or whatever the number is, I don't, I don't remember specifics, but, you know, and then, and then that if it's random width, then It's treated as not as

Unknown Speaker  41:21
it's calculated as a layer. So it's a 4040, inch wide. Is a layer. Point five, five would be, I mean,

Unknown Speaker  41:31
you could see here four times it's it's 2022,

Unknown Speaker  41:35
inches

Unknown Speaker  41:39
of random width

Unknown Speaker  41:42
lumber raw

Unknown Speaker  41:45
material is something that we're working on adding for pricing purposes, the sizer. If it goes through sizer,

Unknown Speaker  41:53
what can't does it get cut out of

Unknown Speaker  41:57
this shows how many, how many times can you get a take

Unknown Speaker  42:02
this random off 1116 by five and a half out of a five and a half by six.

Unknown Speaker  42:09
Waste percentages, additional instructions for sizing, raw material for sewing. We do have the ability to

Unknown Speaker  42:17
on some like like a, especially on the splitter.

Unknown Speaker  42:25
The splitter might,

Unknown Speaker  42:29
let's see,

Unknown Speaker  42:32
actually in needle swings, the splitter never happens first.

Unknown Speaker  42:38
You might have a splitter here, and the splitter splits it in half,

Unknown Speaker  42:44
which means that if you're getting four of these, then, well, you need

Unknown Speaker  42:50
dimensions in here, but,

Unknown Speaker  42:54
but you'll only the sizer will only yield two, or saw and saw one will only yield two, but then saw two is going to yield four, because it's splitting

Unknown Speaker  43:06
raw materials you've got some experience with. That's just all the fasteners and other things required,

Unknown Speaker  43:14
the pricing then you might have gotten. I'm going to create user reports, just because there's so much

Unknown Speaker  43:22
detail and change in how we're trying to nail down the exact pricing model. I think I created the support. Yeah, you did create this report. So I'm creating custom versions. The one interesting thing, I don't know how familiar are with this one, well, this was a fun project, so based off of all our

Unknown Speaker  43:44
assembly data,

Unknown Speaker  43:47
we I wrote a Python I worked with, I use cursor, so AI worked with AI to test a whole bunch of models

Unknown Speaker  43:59
to come up with the most accurate way to calculate assembly time based on,

Unknown Speaker  44:08
you know, these factors that that you're familiar with, and then so script runs, runs, uses web services, downloads a report of the assembly data, pushes it through a whole bunch of models, picks the most, the best model out of that, the most accurate model, and then calculates these variables and pushes it back up into into settings. And then we can use that to say, you know this, this palette takes seven minutes each to

Unknown Speaker  44:41
assemble. So

Unknown Speaker  44:44
wait,

Unknown Speaker  44:48
yeah,

Unknown Speaker  44:51
yeah.

Unknown Speaker  44:55
Also the other, the other main thing, I guess also, it might be interesting to know where the.

Unknown Speaker  45:00
Project is going the other main things are as well the

Unknown Speaker  45:05
we are sorry this is the wrong one,

Unknown Speaker  45:10
score calculator prints. So we're going to be importing

Unknown Speaker  45:17
all of the prints. So currently, all of these prints are in a file drawer there. None of them are none of them were digitized as of two months ago, and they're working on scanning them in and digitizing them. And then our plan is, I don't think you'll be involved in much of this, but our plan is to be able to generate prints. When you generate the cut list will will size the original PDF down just a little bit and put a header on the top with some information, and then regenerate it using using a whiskey, a Python

Unknown Speaker  45:55
whiskey, for that

Unknown Speaker  46:00
pricing and data and pricing, pricing right now is a major thing.

Unknown Speaker  46:07
Probably end up backing off on development a little bit at that point, but there's all kinds of things down the road, potentially accounting system integration, managing inventory.

Unknown Speaker  46:22
I um, delivery scheduling, potentially,

Unknown Speaker  46:26
we'll just, we'll just see, but,

Unknown Speaker  46:30
yeah,

Unknown Speaker  46:37
good, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  46:41
all right. Well,

Unknown Speaker  46:44
any more questions, you good? Not for now I'm good. Thank you for your time. Matthias, yes, gladly. Thank you. We'll talk later. Sure. Goodbye, yep, goodbye.
