Hey John, that was supposed to be an audio message and clearly it didn't go through and I kind of forgot about that until now. And anyway, here we go. Here it is, as I remember it. The exercise is basically for each person to pick something that they really enjoy doing. Might be a hobby or just something that they really enjoy. And then have them name say five or so adjectives that describe it. So if somebody likes painting, it might be because they like life in growth and greenery or they might be HC as they like. They describe it as patient and intriguing and complex. And you have everybody go around, if you're doing it with your students, you're probably gonna want to jot down whatever the adjectives are that they're writing down the activity and the adjectives. And then once you once you do that, once you've got the whole way around and you say, okay, by the way, the adjectives that you describe, use to describe this thing that you really like to do is actually is actually describes you and then you use that as kind of a launching pad for understanding them. And if people don't, you know, if you have a lot of people you're going through, they might not all remember what they said. If you had a chance to write them down. You can remind them and they can give feedback on Yes, that's me. Absolutely. And where they might not want to think it's them. Anyway, never the Ramblers voice message in the work. Now you can read it or you can listen to it. Anyway. Have a good day.
