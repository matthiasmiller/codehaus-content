Unknown Speaker  00:33
I Hey, Ben, Hey there. Matthias,

Unknown Speaker  01:09
good morning.

Speaker 1  01:10
Hey, Mark this your face that I read the name and like, sorry, I know you.

Unknown Speaker  01:21
And well

Speaker 2  01:23
Drew is going to join us in just a minute. I think Leanne is as well. Do we want to I've got four things on my list. It's

Unknown Speaker  01:35
credits, review,

Speaker 2  01:36
the standard cost percentages, notes on vendor invoice entry, and then something else went on pass you on note holder account. So should we just quickly do the standard costs and percentages?

Unknown Speaker  01:55
Yeah, we can do that.

Speaker 2  02:05
Do you have some other other place you want to start?

Unknown Speaker  02:12
No, not necessarily.

Speaker 2  02:18
Okay, so you're saying, Do you want to also unfreeze production overhead? Okay, also, as in, what else did you unfreeze? Did you also unfreeze production, labor

Unknown Speaker  02:32
for it, for

Unknown Speaker  02:32
those like eight or 10 buildings, I

Speaker 1  02:35
haven't done anything on the buildings themselves, but, well, but when you know by I mean my understanding so ABC, those those buildings are marked frozen on both production labor and production overhead, and my understanding is we have percentages for both of those. And am I assuming right that those should not be frozen, or that neither of those should be frozen? Going forward, at least, we'll start with

Speaker 2  03:15
that. Okay, it's it. This is for it's for affordable barn company Plan three specifically for this applies, right? So if you look at that, those should not be frozen. I believe they're not frozen anymore. As of sometime in May, they were changed to a different percentage and not frozen. Is that what you're seeing?

Unknown Speaker  03:40
Let me, let me go. Let me go, pull up. Um,

Speaker 1  03:55
so ABC, three, I entered, there was no change here that I saw. So ABC three here is, here are the numbers, no freezing. But for some reasons, I go over into

Unknown Speaker  04:26
unfreeze remark, but go into here, both production labor and production overhead are frozen,

Speaker 2  04:37
yeah, and they were okay. It's okay. I think it'd be most helpful. If you go to a built buildings report for

Unknown Speaker  04:47
I go do to just plant. I. Yeah, the portable bond company plant, 3441, to today.

Unknown Speaker  05:09
No, let's just do this. And,

Speaker 2  05:16
okay, there's not a lot of buildings. But then if you go to the only college group we really want to see are the the bill date and well, I mean, the others don't really matter, but the bill date and then the standard and actual costing columns,

Unknown Speaker  05:35
which are

Speaker 3  05:40
new. I beautiful, okay, but these, these columns, typically are

Unknown Speaker  05:45
all on the built buildings report,

Unknown Speaker  05:49
like there's about eight or 10,

Speaker 1  05:52
maybe there's a different built buildings. Report, is

Speaker 2  05:55
it some call something else? Ben, it's the you just send me the report.

Speaker 1  06:01
Think last or this week for the for the build buildings report is that where? Yeah, that's automated

Speaker 4  06:11
email. No, I, I

Speaker 1  06:18
here. I'm sending you the link that I would pull to use for build buildings.

Unknown Speaker  06:24
Actually, I'll put it in the Zoom chat here. Ben,

Speaker 2  06:27
just just send him the exact same report that you did for that you had sent me for, if you still have it. Well, the link is fine. Let's just Yeah, that one that's currently set to Ohio for the month of May. So yeah, just take that report and show a date range of April 1 through today.

Unknown Speaker  06:56
Got it. That's my raw materials consumed. Or yeah,

Speaker 2  07:04
so can we and then can you, yeah? Just, just go to the ABC three buildings.

Unknown Speaker  07:11
We gotta see this

Unknown Speaker  07:18
builder. Well,

Unknown Speaker  07:39
I again.

Unknown Speaker  07:53
All right. So if we do, then we can do, I mean, not, right. We

Speaker 2  07:58
can just scroll down and there's, there's only eight or 10. Now, if you go to, if you follow those to the to the right, and you you'll see that, okay, in the actual the Okay, the production labor, actual cause, actually, if you could sort these by build date, yet, that would be,

Unknown Speaker  08:22
would be, probably helpful. This

Unknown Speaker  08:37
should be something others is something full name. Let

Unknown Speaker  08:41
me just go ahead and

Unknown Speaker  09:00
um. Live building.

Unknown Speaker  09:16
Builder equals the

Unknown Speaker  09:27
I think that's

Unknown Speaker  09:37
right. I just,

Speaker 1  09:44
yeah, okay, so then that will let us do,

Unknown Speaker  09:52
and then we can slow down, build on,

Speaker 2  09:55
okay, if you go to the right where you have the actual pause. Yes, the so we'll see that the raw materials actual cost is doing is functioning correctly. I assume that last or that we've applied actual cost through April, so I expect that's why we're why we're seeing numbers there. But if you go to the what I'm puzzled is the production labor actual cost, and the production overhead, actual cost. They're they're freezing, and then at a certain time, they switch to No, and you're saying there was no

Unknown Speaker  10:29
no. It's gonna find out. Like

Speaker 2  10:32
drew, I think you made a change at some point. I thought you made a change at some point,

Unknown Speaker  10:38
but maybe not. I think

Speaker 5  10:39
you knew the whole Well, I went to these plant three buildings, and put in the actual costs for all of them. Is probably, is just that's where my list ended. Like other the stuff that's not froze is beyond the end of the list.

Unknown Speaker  10:58
That I think I gave you a list. Well,

Unknown Speaker  11:02
somebody did something. I came up with a list of

Speaker 2  11:11
why did I Yeah, so you manually entered those off of a list I had given you.

Speaker 5  11:22
Well, or either it was I manually entered them off of going and finding all of them and but how would I have known if I would have just found the buildings based on the builder? How would I have known what they're supposed to be?

Speaker 2  11:41
Well, maybe I'm missing something it sounds like, I mean, I, what I, what I had wanted to do is just clear, all of those, clear, all of those actual cause since, for everything built since April 1, not, not the materials. Materials. Can we see? Are those only through April? The materials? Yeah, they are no. So I was looking at the invoice date. Were you looking at the bill Date column? Sorry, yes,

Speaker 1  12:18
the bill date, right here. So here, here's where it is. It's that simple.

Speaker 2  12:21
So, so that's hooray. Now I would do the same. Everything built since four one should, should have that the freeze changed to know and the actual cost is cleared out. So when we go to apply actual costs at the end of second quarter, it just handles them, same as all the other buildings.

Unknown Speaker  12:54
That makes sense. I

Speaker 5  13:01
What's special about those buildings over there? Well, I mean, they're not over there, but

Speaker 2  13:05
there's, they're custom, like, they're two story buildings. They're where we'll eventually want to do per job, like, say they're but I was thinking

Speaker 5  13:16
there was something about those buildings that was, was the reason why you wanted them

Unknown Speaker  13:22
froze like,

Unknown Speaker  13:25
you know, I wonder if it was because.

Unknown Speaker  13:29
Was there something their contractors doing it?

Speaker 2  13:33
No, no, we're doing it with employees. Was it because it was not. There was something when you apply it standard cost, it was not applying to these because of how it was set up.

Speaker 4  13:55
Maybe I don't recall, so I guess

Speaker 2  13:59
we, if we give Matthias to go ahead to do it, then we'll just, yeah.

Speaker 1  14:04
I mean, I don't mind, I don't mind doing it, as long as you guys are fine with any potential fallout,

Speaker 2  14:13
good or bad. Yeah, just go ahead and do it, anything since four one. Just take out the fees. And

Speaker 5  14:21
now, do you? Do you want the raw materials actual cost?

Speaker 2  14:25
No, the raw materials are fine, just the production, labor and production overhead. Just clear

Unknown Speaker  14:33
out the trees there.

Unknown Speaker  14:35
So good on that. Matthias,

Speaker 1  14:40
yeah, let me I'm jotting a note in right now and then so that I can Yeah,

Speaker 2  14:49
as soon as you have that down, just let us know. Then we want to run new income statements and new new reports, so as soon. This is something that you can do by or could you do this, say, in the next, I guess, by noon or so, just so we have incompleteness.

Speaker 1  15:10
Yeah. Or if you, if you guys want to wait, if you guys want to wait five minutes, I can do it now.

Unknown Speaker  15:20
Sure. Let's, let's just do it now.

Unknown Speaker  15:26
This is what works.

Speaker 1  15:28
So this is the, is this the same list? I mean, this is the list you gave me. Is that? Is that? But let's, we know for sure we need to change these anyway. So let's go change these. Um, so then also

Unknown Speaker  16:01
materials and

Speaker 4  16:36
so It works right on this one, and I'm least There

Speaker 1  16:43
we go. We've got the actual cost. I guess the basis should maybe also switch to,

Unknown Speaker  16:53
or be blank,

Speaker 1  16:55
any cost. Okay, we'll just do that. I'm

Unknown Speaker  17:18
what's the basis of

Unknown Speaker  17:32
i All right, you're happy.

Speaker 2  17:47
So okay, that also we didn't clear any before a no. This was all after a first.

Speaker 1  17:54
This is all from the this is all from the list that you gave me. Okay,

Speaker 2  17:59
yeah, perfect. One other question on this, though, is, Drew, and I were talking about it this morning. Can okay? So we get July 15, we we apply actual cost for second quarter, and then we say, Okay, now we have a half years worth of history on what our production labor percentage is, and we want to change that starting July 1. Can we go back in history and set, hey, Stan, can we on July 15? Say, effective July one. We want to use this standard costing percentage. I had thought you can't go back in history, but I guess that's the first question, is it possible, or is it not possible?

Speaker 1  18:57
Well, I mean, currently we don't have a way to we don't have a way through the interface to do it. I created the methods, method to do it. If you want to do that regularly, then we should make a way for you to do that regularly. There's a question of what happens, like, are we only updating standard cost, and if we are freezing costs as anything, oh, here's my and, and if, if there's a change in freezing, do we do anything with freezing, or is it just updating standard

Speaker 2  19:34
costs? It would only be updating standard cost. And I ideally you could not, you should not be able to, okay, if you're doing, say, production overhead, you should only be able to back date that change in history to the day the first day after the frozen period. So. Right? So I'm realizing that that's something we will want to do regularly, because we'll never have, we'll never have actual cost supplied, right on the last day of of the period, and then, you know, set at mid starts. Everything starts

Unknown Speaker  20:25
on the first day. Now, this is not a huge I mean, it's it's

Speaker 2  20:38
not a huge deal. The more we get it dialed in, you know, if we're, if we're using 11.3 and on July 15, we say, oh, it should be 11.2 then we'll probably just no big deal. We'll just start using 11.2 on July 15, and from that point forward, from your site, what would it take to make so that it could be backdated?

Speaker 1  21:17
I mean, that's, that's trivial. Hindu,

Speaker 2  21:22
okay? I'd say put it on your list and give us the ability to backdate. Okay, we're currently, you can only date it as of effective as of today.

Speaker 1  21:39
You can enter historical ones. We just don't have a process to to apply it historically. And so what we'll give you is a way to apply it historically. It's, it's kind of a here to be dragons kind of thing, like you guys are free to do whatever you want to. I mean, we can. We can only give you options to back date. I don't know. Well, we're expecting her to do this anyway. Good, backdating

Speaker 5  22:06
back to the previous applied, actual costs being applied. So if there were actual costs applied on March 31 you can't backdate beyond that.

Unknown Speaker  22:19
Yep. Now

Unknown Speaker  22:22
a lot more work to block that so we can

Unknown Speaker  22:27
No,

Speaker 1  22:29
you'll you'll just have to run it three times. You'll have to run it once for raw materials. If you want to do it, you have to run it once for production labor. If you want to do it, you have to run it once production overhead. And you'll need to do that for every builder that you change. So if you want that, if you want that protection,

Speaker 2  22:52
that sounds fair, I'd say, Yeah, we do want it just and we do want the protection.

Unknown Speaker  22:58
We won't be using it a lot. So good.

Unknown Speaker  23:09
All right, so let me make a quick note on this. No worries.

Speaker 1  23:18
All right, so I guess the plan here, Mark, clarify, this has been wrong. The plan here is, let me just walk you through how credit memos work, and you can raise any concerns. We're going to we're planning to do an update this weekend so we can get changes put in. Mark,

Speaker 2  23:43
yeah, could you just that the update this weekend is, should bring everything live that you're going to be showing us. Is that right?

Unknown Speaker  23:52
Yeah. And I think, I think most of,

Unknown Speaker  23:58
oh, wait a second,

Speaker 1  24:01
yes. I need to demo a different system. I forgot that. I forgot some of these changes

Speaker 6  24:11
one second here. I

Unknown Speaker  25:09
All right, so we vendor invoices,

Speaker 1  25:15
all right. So the way that you add vendor invoices is going to be from the vendor the credit memos is going to be from the vendor invoice itself. So you pull up the vendor invoice

Unknown Speaker  25:29
and you do Edit Mode go

Speaker 1  25:41
into credit memos and hit, create new credit memo. Actually, I guess you would have to go into edit mode to create a new one. But you say the vendor invoice ID is, you know, Lowe's credit memo, 1234, whatever they assign. And then you say, we got a, do we have any shipping? We got a $5 credit on shipping, and we got a $3 credit on the PO, and we want to reverse the amount correction so we're also going to actually I

Unknown Speaker  26:24
guess we could do this. I think we can do this,

Speaker 1  26:28
which is a total credit amount of 2499 and then your places, roofer notes. And then how do you want to this label needs to change. Let me start taking notes. And then then the question is, how are we going to use this? So on Lowe's, it would be, it's going to be returned to the original payment. For most, in many cases, it'd be applied to eight under invoice anyone, or we're going to wait for deposit, which means they were in check. So that's the credit memo creation process. We're going to say this returns the original payment. And now people credit memos. I'm

Speaker 1  27:24
you can, you can see, see the amount, amount here also the

Unknown Speaker  27:36
Worcester laws,

Unknown Speaker  27:37
so that all

Unknown Speaker  27:42
now in a different scenario,

Speaker 1  27:49
let's do, I don't know, I've been playing around with elite metal. So once you have here's some, some other kind of memos I created just for fun and testing. This one is marked to apply to the vendor invoice. So when you do that, you can go to any elite metal invoice, and if you want to pay it with credit, you will go down to pay with credit and blend this out, get the plus, select the credit memo that you want to use. It shows the amount remaining. And I want to use, you know, $357 for some reason, actually, I'm just going to go back to what I actually had, 457 and and save and if I do the wrong amount, so total payments with credits plus payment amount should equal minimums total. So in this case, 37 I sold 100 and $1,000 in one cent, I think

Unknown Speaker  29:02
so that balances

Speaker 1  29:08
then for Drew when he goes from the check. This is mostly for interest sake.

Speaker 4  29:19
Let's see. Oh, you get that done. But this thing of the what it says on checks is

Unknown Speaker  29:33
this, the rate.

Unknown Speaker  29:37
Did you put it on the printable?

Speaker 1  29:39
I did not. Let's do checks to print. Let's, let's print the check. Okay, sorry that. Sorry, vendor, sorry, I'm in the wrong place. Vendor needing payment. Oh, let's go ahead and pay. This was that,

Unknown Speaker  29:58
and I don't remember. I.

Unknown Speaker  30:03
Oh, that was shed time. Yeah, all right,

Unknown Speaker  30:09
so we go to shed time. Go down to, oh, that's why

Speaker 1  30:28
I had paid this fearlessly. So, no, there's nothing paid approved.

Unknown Speaker  30:42
Here. Here's the metal,

Speaker 1  30:48
um, it shows the available credit. It shows the balance, so it shows that we're not actually using all the credit in this case. So normally, Drew would go in and be like, Hey, we should be using the rest of the credit to pay this, but we're going to ignore that. We're going to give it a check.

Unknown Speaker  31:07
And

Unknown Speaker  31:13
that pops up over here, and let's

Speaker 1  31:21
zone the numbers so we can bypass the printing process and just put in PDF. So

Speaker 1  31:39
then the check step will show the vendor invoice total minus the credit memo amount, with the credit memo number

Unknown Speaker  31:47
with the balance, which is the check amount,

Speaker 1  31:50
just as A as a trail for vendors.

Unknown Speaker  32:00
That's another hallelujah from the day.

Speaker 1  32:09
So cross your fingers. Should be pretty straightforward. I guess Leanne would Gabs questions, feedback. I'm

Speaker 7  32:18
just here because I was told to be here. I don't, I don't see anything here as much even I'm not sitting in the credit seat right now writing the check. So I'm sure this is a lot bigger to Drew. And who have more to say on this specific one, for sure,

Speaker 5  32:34
the on the the creating the credit memo side, you know where you're getting this credit memo from vendors

Unknown Speaker  32:44
to be entered? Like,

Speaker 2  32:48
should we? Should we do one for lows, which is notorious for credits, like, if there were we're applying it to the original

Unknown Speaker  32:59
payments. So

Speaker 2  33:05
oh no, actually, pick one in North Yeah, North Carolina, North Carolina, where they're prepaid,

Unknown Speaker  33:19
supposed to be repaid. But,

Unknown Speaker  33:22
yeah, yeah, that looks good.

Speaker 1  33:27
Sorry. Okay, so this one, this one's marked prepaid under if I we get a credit memo, we'll create a new credit memo, and it will be whatever, you know, Lowe's the annual credit memo, whatever number date assigned to it. It's the vendor number.

Speaker 7  33:47
Is this live currently in this office? Okay, so every invoice doesn't yet have the Create credit memo on it at this point.

Unknown Speaker  33:56
No, it will go live on Saturday. Gotcha. So,

Speaker 1  34:08
here let's actually you can also jump back to the original vendor invoice this way. And so we've got some insulation, and we're going to say,

Speaker 1  34:29
we're going to say they're 3094 each, so we're going To do a credit for one of them,

Speaker 6  34:40
which is in this account. Oops, I'm sorry I clicked the wrong button.

Unknown Speaker  34:50
So find the account.

Unknown Speaker  34:55
Why is it not?

Speaker 1  34:58
Oh, these are non po credits. Nevermind. Yeah, we don't care about which account it was, so we have a credit for the court po items of 3954

Speaker 2  35:10
if I ask, can you explain to Leanne when, when? Like, the use case for, yeah, those two fields when to which to use.

Speaker 1  35:19
Okay, so shipping tax and discounts, if there's any adjustments to any of those, that's what we've used in that case, the reason being, those costs get distributed to the PO items, if we have po items, otherwise the non po items. Po amount gets distributed only to the PO items. The non po credits gets applied to the account, to the non po account that you specified. So if you've got a non PO line item on the invoice, you can just just see those that way,

Speaker 5  35:56
and that should always be the same account as on the index right? Yeah, the non po should match the non po on

Speaker 7  36:07
right. And so when you're doing it as a purchase order, amount that's linking to the entire purchase order, but not necessarily to specific product,

Speaker 1  36:20
correct? So I guess you guys might need to fill in the process that when you get two things need to happen. I don't know who does it, but let's say we got we ordered 60 bags. We thought we got 60 bags. They gave us 59 so two things need to happen. One, we need a credit appeal, credit for this amount. But then we also need, we also need to adjust. And if you refresh, you'll see there's now a discrepancy because of the credit that the invoice does not match the selected product. And so we also then need to go back.

Speaker 7  36:59
You're really handling it the same as when we were doing it manually to make it match. You're going in, you're adjusting the product amounts, either by value or by quantity or both, depending on why they're not matching. And that is all that reconciliation is a completely manual process, and is, you know, pretty much unchanged,

Speaker 1  37:29
correct. And the difference then is, how do you get the credit, the how do you account for the credits, in terms of reconciling the original vendor invoice total with what should be paid. And then, yeah, and solves, how much credit do we have outstanding? Sure, and in this case, because it's Lowe's,

Speaker 7  37:58
you're gonna it's already tied into automatically return no but

Speaker 1  38:02
we should do that. We should have a setting on a vendor to save the default credit usage, right?

Speaker 7  38:09
I mean, it wouldn't hurt if it's not a two time.

Speaker 5  38:17
Well, basically default would be, did you have a default there?

Speaker 1  38:24
It does default to apply to vendor invoice.

Speaker 5  38:27
Yeah, okay, so that would be great. There's only going to be a handful that that's not what we're doing, so

Speaker 7  38:38
only a handful of companies who they order from a lock. We do a

Unknown Speaker  38:45
lot of good clarification.

Speaker 5  38:53
In fact, it might only be about, well, it's about a handful because I guess he closes has its own right.

Unknown Speaker  39:06
Cool

Unknown Speaker  39:09
makes sense. I mean, I don't know what else to explain. I

Speaker 7  39:13
don't think there is anything else too. We're just now not creating additional we're not creating negative vendor invoices, and, you know, posting to the verification report and then just showing up under that builder ID, you now actually have a credit memo and it it ties in more smoothly. Makes a lot of sense.

Speaker 2  39:36
Is there? Matthias is there? I think we talked about having reporting to show available credits, like, for a builder, like, is there any reporting like that? Or,

Speaker 1  39:48
currently, Josh said he was going to do it, and so I don't, I don't manage any of Josh's stuff. If he says he is, he's going to do it sometime, and I don't know it's a black box. Bucks, so talk to him about it. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  40:01
um,

Speaker 5  40:03
just a question that I came up with, if, if it's just a credit in general from the company, and at least they don't tell us if it applies specifically to a specific invoice that that they're crediting us on, can we create like a zero. How would we do that, create a new invoice for zero and then create a credit memo from that invoice? Or how would we create a credit memo that that doesn't apply back to any particular

Unknown Speaker  40:41
when? What's the real life scenario? Real life scenario

Speaker 7  40:46
is they shipped more product than we ordered, and when we said, hey, we didn't order that much, they said, Just keep it for free.

Speaker 1  40:54
So then you would have you still, it still needs to hit inventory. Like, wouldn't you want to have a have a PO for free product and a vendor invoice with a $0 amount and a credit member that zeros it

Speaker 5  41:08
all out, yeah, probably or change the original po to just include those extras and

Speaker 7  41:14
make everything cheaper by the amount that you were crediting.

Speaker 2  41:22
But you're thinking through something like, I don't know, they, at the end of the year, they give us a

Speaker 5  41:29
kickback for, well, no, it's more a thing where they just don't tell us, like they're they're saying, hey, our account shows that you're overpaid by X dollars. You know, here's, here's a credit, and we it might be an accumulation from five different things, and they don't the five different invoices, and they don't tell us what it is like. It's, it's more just we're missing information. It obviously does apply to something somewhere, but we don't have a way to well,

Speaker 1  42:03
but so you're still going to have to make a decision where you're going to apply it to. So it still seems like you need to have it under invoice that that

Unknown Speaker  42:15
well you like,

Speaker 5  42:16
in a way, I guess you could just take, just take any your most recent and

Unknown Speaker  42:22
just right, I

Speaker 7  42:24
think that's what I mean, that that's would be the deep the default workaround that I would probably default to, if it was something that we didn't know, picked the most recent or, you know, largest invoice in the last month, and tied off to that. Yeah,

Speaker 1  42:42
no, I think the largest, largest invoice, this is well versed in this is doing the largest invoice seems like a logical way to do it. It distributes it approximately across appropriate bounds to get you

Unknown Speaker  42:57
appropriate accounts.

Speaker 5  42:59
Yeah, that's all the questions I have. I think it should looks like, I mean, looks like a wall working

Speaker 4  43:06
system. Okay, good.

Speaker 2  43:15
I know that on our last call in drew it asked, like we talked with Dwayne about how we're going to start using this and what drew you just asked that, you know what, through the, I think, through the month of June, whenever you do a credit, just Yeah, copy him on it, so that he can, he's aware of it, and can track see if The accounting transactions are all time out correctly, as opposed to, you know, mid July doing reconciles and saying, Oh, this, this wasn't quite working like it was supposed to. So I think that's about the only thing we need to get started,

Speaker 5  43:53
yeah. So, yeah, just so I can kind of check them live that the accounting is happening correctly, because it's we can't really check it without doing it. So, yeah,

Speaker 7  44:06
all right. Well, otherwise, I feel like it seems pretty intuitive, and, you know, goes very well with everything else we've been doing. I don't see it being problematic.

Unknown Speaker  44:18
Very well, good. I

Unknown Speaker  44:22
think that's all we, we had for you land. So,

Speaker 7  44:25
all right, well, I will, I will leave and let you to the rest of your time.

Unknown Speaker  44:29
Thank you. Thanks. Thank you.

Unknown Speaker  44:37
All right, so we got

Unknown Speaker  44:40
vendor invoice entry drew you just wanted to add wanted to ask

Unknown Speaker  44:43
that. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  44:45
did that get added that quick vendor invoice entry thing?

Unknown Speaker  44:51
I'm pretty sure. Let me

Speaker 1  44:57
reconcile here. Let me pull the test system. I'm not sure if it's not sure if it's live or not because of reconcile transactions.

Speaker 4  45:14
Let's see I'm very chipping. You. All

Unknown Speaker  45:31
right, wait for the load.

Speaker 5  45:32
I thought it was pretty intuitive to put it in here so that you don't have AP entering them that way, that was good.

Speaker 1  45:44
So, yeah, I mean, here you go, quick enter, payment method. So primary checking default date. There is no default date on this for some reason. Well, it's because there is no end, I don't even know. Oh no, yeah, yeah. So six, five. So here's your quick Enter, and then you just go in and,

Unknown Speaker  46:03
right,

Speaker 1  46:05
put in the vendor account, the notes and payment ID,

Unknown Speaker  46:11
so the Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  46:14
let's Make sure this actually works.

Speaker 5  46:20
I used it, it just wasn't quite effective, because when I when I posted to Uncategorized expense my Uncategorized expense report needs to have notes, or it has notes. That's how I tell the managers what card was actually used to make this payment so that they can figure out, like it was this vendor, it was this person buying so then it's probably goes in this account. That's why I need notes. But those are, those are line item notes, right?

Speaker 1  46:57
I mean, they're line item notes, yeah. So do you need to change the uncategorized expenses report?

Unknown Speaker  47:05
Well,

Speaker 5  47:08
I mean, shouldn't if it's if it's line item notes that will, well, those line item notes come through to the transaction.

Unknown Speaker  47:16
No. So,

Speaker 5  47:22
because these line I'm notes here are coming off the transaction like, that's what that's the information there that I need, having coming through.

Unknown Speaker  47:38
Well, you

Unknown Speaker  47:42
them, where is a

Speaker 5  47:44
I mean, I need a way to be able to fill that space. I don't know how that would be done.

Unknown Speaker  47:48
So it's coming off the chat for the deposit as well.

Speaker 4  47:59
We need a vendor invoice.

Unknown Speaker  48:20
We could see,

Speaker 2  48:27
oh, it's on that quick vendor update, but you can't see them on the uncategorized expense. It doesn't pull in terms of the transaction. So what you're the way you're using this is you go to do a reconcile, and you have 28 items that are missing. Rather than create transactions, you create vendor invoices.

Speaker 5  48:48
Well, isn't on the vendor invoice, isn't there a a line, a memo or something in the non po lines? Can you actually pull that?

Speaker 1  49:07
Can we just give you a report of vendor invoices with Uncategorized expenses?

Speaker 5  49:17
So we just have two we'd have Uncategorized vendor invoices and Uncategorized transactions. Like would be two ways to go to it. Like, this is Uncategorized transactions, basically

Unknown Speaker  49:34
like literally pushing that stuff across.

Unknown Speaker  49:46
Are we doable? But a little No, I mean,

Speaker 5  49:53
like, there's still times where I do write the transactions i. Mostly it's because, like, okay, so take Google ads. AP is never going to get a receipt for them, so it's not a confusion issue for them and it's and I don't need to push an update if I write a transaction. Right uh, but then again, a lot of those I'm not writing to Uncategorized expense because I'm not expecting to ever, you know, I'm writing it right to the account, um, an Uncategorized a vendor invoice report showing Uncategorized expense lines. I think that would work,

Speaker 5  50:48
as long as it, you know, gives me the notes the report, gives me the field that we fill in on that quick entry

Speaker 1  51:02
that seems to me to be like, Okay, so let's say we did that. You would want to see what, what old do you want to you would want to see the date, the invoice date, the vendor invoice number, well, the vendor name, vendor invoice number, the vendor

Speaker 5  51:21
invoice. A lot of times, I'm not going to know the vendor invoice number because I'm getting off the statement, the bank statement, or the credit card statement. So the date of the transaction or of the vendor invoice, I guess, is what we would call it, at that point, that day, the vendor, the amount and the notes is that's the only information that I'm going to have. So, I mean, I guess, well, and

Speaker 5  52:08
I'm just thinking if there would be a way to know so that I could see on this report, if, if somebody did come in and change some information but never applied the correct account to it like so in other words, it's still an Uncategorized but they Well, okay, no, we want it sorted by payment method, then that would be another piece of information. I um,

Unknown Speaker  52:49
I think that's all that we're going to need to see.

Unknown Speaker  52:54
Okay, yeah,

Speaker 5  52:59
yeah, if that's a faster fix, let's just go with with the vendor or with the Uncategorized vendor invoice

Unknown Speaker  53:09
reporting that

Speaker 2  53:21
node holder account. Should we? Should we cover that now? Should we do later this afternoon, prepare for maybe we have another 35 minutes just kind of

Unknown Speaker  53:31
walk through what it is, and maybe we're just

Speaker 5  53:35
okay. That's all that was, all the things. The other thing that we

Speaker 2  53:39
had, yeah, yeah, okay. Did you have anything else? Do you have anything for us?

Unknown Speaker  53:47
No, I

Speaker 1  53:51
think I've got, I know exactly what it should be doing, and I think you've got running into,

Speaker 2  53:58
okay, well, here's one thing we want to run past you is so we have private node holders that have money, typically employees or, well, not not just employees in the companies. And so currently, if you look at, oh, well, you can look at like, if you look at time, there's going to be we have loan on the balance sheet. You'll see those note holder accounts. And at the end of every quarter, we mail out a statement of activity to each Yeah, let's take a look at one of them do. Maybe I'll just, I don't know, just pick one off the balance sheet,

Unknown Speaker  54:49
like you want to general ledger for one of these. Yeah.

Speaker 1  54:59
I. Uh, wow, this is painful. We've got VAs in India, or, you know, running these reports in the back end. Um, just kidding. Okay, um,

Unknown Speaker  55:18
do like a

Unknown Speaker  55:21
no, not. It's

Unknown Speaker  55:24
sure,

Unknown Speaker  55:30
no, that it's not

Unknown Speaker  55:33
user liabilities.

Unknown Speaker  55:41
Wait, why is it

Speaker 2  55:49
not easy? Yeah, like that. Daniel Bontrager, tomorrow,

Unknown Speaker  56:24
do a race here.

Unknown Speaker  56:28
Maybe it's

Unknown Speaker  56:33
yep, yep.

Speaker 1  56:36
Contact, where's the name, account type, account names, and these are account names, okay,

Speaker 5  56:43
do do shed time up for your company. There you go. And then, and

Unknown Speaker  56:52
then it'd be a what you said to like,

Unknown Speaker  56:55
long term notes.

Unknown Speaker  56:59
Well, we can actually do,

Speaker 5  57:03
I mean, you just select them there, yeah, oh, you don't you want to undo that liability, because you're bringing in all a thing, yeah, you're right, yeah. Now you're good to go. You Yeah, after

Unknown Speaker  57:24
this a minute, take up plan a helicopters, all right.

Unknown Speaker  57:30
Oh, so here is

Speaker 2  57:35
actually we should do one that has some has some additional transactions. If you go to a J there's a J something or

Unknown Speaker  57:42
Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  57:54
Okay, so,

Speaker 2  57:55
so what happens here is, basically, you put money in the company and then, like he's paid 6% quarterly. Most people are at the end of every quarter, this 6% will just be compounded onto their balance. And then we'll send out a, what do you call it? Like a statement activity or an activity history of,

Unknown Speaker  58:25
here's,

Speaker 2  58:26
here's what happened to your you know, here, here's the deposits, here's the here's the money you took out, if you took out any, here's the interest you were paid on. And so, so there's, there's kind of two things that, long term, what we want is, I'm imagining these node holders might be their own contact type, and we want to, at the end of the quarter, just, ideally, just render report that gives us, for all node holders that calculates the the interest they've earned and knows whether it's compounded or paid out, and then also creates a report for that period. Typically, we go, I don't know, I've been probably just rolling one year, just, yeah, like a rolling year of what happened in the last year. So that that then that's so there's really two Well, three things. One is calculate the interest. Two is pay out the interest if, if need be like by check, and three is create all of the reports to be mailed out. So we have a manual process we're using. We did that in the first quarter. We're getting to the end of second quarter. We were thinking long term. We want it to be done in here. We just wanted to get a feel from you on how much time it would take to to build something like this. Well, if, if you say you can have something, you know, up and running and working by

Unknown Speaker  1:00:25
July, you know, July 1

Speaker 2  1:00:30
or July 5. Then we would wait on that, if you say it's, you know, much longer than that we have to shuffle other things around. Then we would probably look to improve, make some improvements on what we have currently on our manual process, and wait to do this until the third or fourth quarter.

Speaker 1  1:00:51
Is the are you paying? Do you have to handle what happens if somebody invests money in the middle of like, do you do prorated periods? You have GM people withdrawing with the period, so you need to account for a balanced variable. Balances.

Speaker 5  1:01:11
Yes, yeah, because you know, if they take money out or add money in the middle of the period, you know, prorate your interest rate for the are not per at the rate, but per rate. Your time for the

Speaker 2  1:01:23
basically per day. But how many days was this money?

Unknown Speaker  1:01:29
We got this balance.

Speaker 5  1:01:36
I would also add, you know, if there are certain parts of that that you're saying, Well, this part's easy, but in order to print a report, it's going to take a lot more. Like, there's pieces that can be done simply, you know, like, let's say the interest calculation. You know, if we can get a report that that calculates interest for us, well, that's, that's huge on the manual process. Yeah,

Speaker 1  1:02:01
can we does the is this compounded quarterly, right? Yeah, it's compounded, yeah, okay, so, so we could do an average daily balance times interest rate divided by four, correct? I

Unknown Speaker  1:02:24
So,

Unknown Speaker  1:02:27
okay, you're saying you would you would calculate.

Unknown Speaker  1:02:36
You're saying that would get us the same net result as interesting.

Speaker 2  1:02:45
I don't know if it does, then we've been making it way harder than we would have had to, like you're saying on this one. Yeah, the beginning balance was 22,000 it increased 10,000 in this quarter or in this Wow, in this time frame. Okay, I guess yeah. Let's say an increase 10,000 in this time frame. Okay. If, if starting balance was 20, it's beginning of a quarter, and the ending balance was 30, then you would say 25,000, times 6% divided by four.

Speaker 1  1:03:26
No, it's like it's like this, if it was so a quarter has about 90 days, just to keep it simple, so we had a $20,000 balance for for 60 days, we had a $30,000 balance. We were saying we we withdrew, or we deposited 10,000

Unknown Speaker  1:03:46
deposits, probably more likely

Speaker 1  1:03:47
so, so we had $30,000 balance for 30 days. We're total 90 days for the quarter. Round numbers to keep things simple. So the average daily balance is this, times this, this times this

Unknown Speaker  1:04:05
divided by

Speaker 1  1:04:09
two. Average Daily Balance was 23, 333, 6% rate. It's this times this divided by four, is the 6% an annual rate, and that gives you a $350 payout,

Unknown Speaker  1:04:24
makes sense?

Speaker 5  1:04:25
Yeah, that's that's not how we were calculating, but we were needing to make all the entries just like that. You know, say this was added? Well, what we did is this much, there was transaction for this much at this day in the period. So we're we're needing to enter all that information, whereas, like in assist, you already have all that information, so it keeps us from moving over all that information manually. So.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:00
We don't want to try and put that on the tlacono thing. The only reason we're showing the percentage here

Unknown Speaker  1:10:08
is just a

Speaker 2  1:10:12
just to know what percentage that could also, I don't know that that's, I mean, it's, it's okay there, but I think

Unknown Speaker  1:10:22
it would be nice to not have it there. Yeah,

Speaker 1  1:10:26
um, well, so I guess my thought is, it sounds to me a little bit like an asset, because Daniel might have two notes at different rates,

Speaker 2  1:10:47
which is true, I think there's there's one, yeah, there are some people that might have two notes, maybe affordable. I think there are.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:59
And so I wonder whether

Unknown Speaker  1:11:04
having a

Speaker 1  1:11:09
here's a note, here's the contact, here's the payment method,

Unknown Speaker  1:11:16
here's the account. I Yes,

Unknown Speaker  1:11:23
excuse me, rate, and

Speaker 2  1:11:26
then also the idea of the payment schedule like, or the payment like, you said, payment type like, or is it? Is it compounded, or is it paid out? And then we have one, which would would be nice, if this one gets a little complicated, but there's one widow that has money here that she she wants paid out like and the first quarter and the third quarter and then the other two quarters is just compounded. Now that I know that's an edge case, and we don't have to solve for that, but the edge cases like that are the ones that also get us in trouble, or we all be.

Speaker 5  1:12:03
Could you just do by each quarter, like first quarter compound or payout, second quarter compound or payout? Sure,

Unknown Speaker  1:12:14
for all the rest, but it's all so

Speaker 1  1:12:18
cutting, cutting through all the noise. The bottom line is, I think more design is required on how we actually want to model notes to make sure that we handle this. I think interest calculations on a per account basis makes sense to me. I mean, and if that's, if that's where the big headache is, that's easy, I think easily delegatable, Jonathan. I actually notes, there's a bigger conversation that could take us down a little bit of rabbit rabbit trail. Well,

Unknown Speaker  1:12:52
that's fine with me. I mean, I think,

Speaker 2  1:12:54
and it's not throw it's not throw away work that you're doing, like, right? It's a step. So how would you okay? You're saying you would when completed. How would you expect this to work? Like, how would drew calculate the interest

Unknown Speaker  1:13:12
so

Unknown Speaker  1:13:16
drew would go to

Speaker 1  1:13:22
accounting? Interest calculator. He pull up the company, and he say, he would say, calculate interest on, you know, he would select long term notes, probably,

Speaker 2  1:13:34
and then he could just exclude, like, the founding that the bank loans are losing.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:42
Yeah, yeah,

Speaker 5  1:13:45
might as well just do. Just select individual accounts.

Speaker 1  1:13:49
Select, okay, great. Even better, selects an individual account and it defaults to prior quarter. It would do, it would it could show the transactions. Well, this is even easier. Show the transactions, show how many days it was, and then and then it would total based on the average daily balance at the bottom. And you would have a

Speaker 4  1:14:22
do and you would include the,

Speaker 1  1:14:32
okay, I have it in my head, but basically, I think you would actually include, you would include the prior, the latest transaction prior to the start of period interest calculation. And then you would show number of days, you know, times number of days within period, or number of days balance was held in period. So. Yes, and then you have all the transactions within the period through the end. And then you you get the daily average, and you multiply it out by the interest of

Speaker 2  1:15:15
it before when you're creating that report, could you also make so that that is the report we could then print off and send along to the node holder.

Speaker 1  1:15:26
Sure we could do that, so we could have, we could show one year's worth of history and for each transaction, that would actually work. I mean, you don't have any accounts. I guess you might have accounts. Okay? Would you be okay if we just show, can we just show literally full history? Show what full history?

Speaker 2  1:15:49
Yeah, because nothing's beyond. I mean, currently it all just goes to one, 123, or 24 so, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:57
So very simple way to do it would be full history for any given item. How long was the how many days was the balance held in the period?

Speaker 1  1:16:08
And you do an average, that's, that's, that's nice. And then if we ever want to narrow the scope, then we would still want to have the last year's history, or the prior, like, if they paid 20,000 in in 2022 and nothing's happened since, we would still show that transaction on their report, because we need it for calculating the daily balance.

Unknown Speaker  1:16:36
I like it,

Speaker 5  1:16:38
and you're still just calculating the new interest entry based on the prior order, not all history.

Speaker 2  1:16:50
I think we should send Matthias. We should mock up, or maybe take a look at what we send out last time. I think we want to make a few changes to that and send him a mock up of, you know, here's kind of what we'd like to see. Or is it? Are you thinking Matthias? It's just a like a transactions by contact report? Could it just be that?

Speaker 1  1:17:11
Well, I mean, it isn't that, but it's something similar to that.

Speaker 5  1:17:14
Well, it'll kind of have a similar look to it.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:21
It's actually pretty close, though.

Speaker 2  1:17:23
Well, okay, the only, I think the only change to this is, is we don't want it grouped by, like payroll, STP. We just want take all the subheadings out and sort by in order of date, right? And obviously, you know, after that we the interest would need to be applied, but we

Speaker 5  1:17:48
may want a different name at the top, instead of debit and credit. It would be like, you know,

Unknown Speaker  1:17:58
draw, withdraw, or, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:18:06
is it? Is investment the right term for it?

Speaker 5  1:18:08
I think so. Because, like, even if it's a an interest compounding, that's an investment too. And, and I put it in the notes that showed up.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:20
Um, like your your interest, yeah, with

Unknown Speaker  1:18:22
the balance column,

Unknown Speaker  1:18:24
would you want this to, well,

Speaker 5  1:18:28
that would be fine, right? And the actually, the account name could come out, really,

Speaker 2  1:18:32
yeah, the true take the account name out and they don't. We don't want to show the transaction ID to like has no value,

Unknown Speaker  1:18:41
right? And

Unknown Speaker  1:18:43
then a heading, I don't know, like be nice to have the

Speaker 1  1:18:49
I like this. Could we is this? Is this too weird group by the account name?

Speaker 2  1:18:59
No. Can you take off the prefix? Is that, is it easy to take off the prefix?

Unknown Speaker  1:19:17
If it's hard, it probably doesn't matter. Yeah,

Speaker 1  1:19:21
no, some kind of account name. There's, there's a way to see it, not see it on the label. Yeah, yep, the label, you're right. And when we would do something like we could do, we could do interest.

Speaker 6  1:19:47
The How much do you care about rounding discrepancies,

Speaker 1  1:19:54
I guess, I guess interest earned could be, it's a fractional amount. We could show interest you. We can show days balance held so interest earned on that balance for that period, which is balance times days held divided by total days and period times interest earned divided by four

Unknown Speaker  1:20:21
and then, and then it would be some

Unknown Speaker  1:20:27
for the interest payout.

Speaker 2  1:20:33
I mean, I think it'd be great. I think drew you probably would as well. But I don't think the people getting these are, yeah, I

Speaker 5  1:20:44
mean, the thing, if they're it's going to be, like, if they're just randomly doing draws, or, like, randomly having those transactions, I don't know. I mean, do they want to see that I earned so much interest before I put this in, this border, and this much after I put this in. And I don't know Well, this would

Unknown Speaker  1:21:07
only be for the current period.

Speaker 2  1:21:11
I think it would have value, because most people like this is one of the one of two people that take out of every paycheck to put in, like, almost, like a 401, K or something. But most people just do sporadically when they have

Speaker 5  1:21:25
like for this guy, would be nice to see, I can see if I had this, then I would be interested in seeing how that.

Speaker 1  1:21:34
But for other guys, it doesn't matter. They're going to have one row that has this filled in. So it's going to it's going to show whatever the balance is. This was held for 90 days this period, and the interest earned was this amount. And yes, why do you have an extra column? But you have to put interest earned somewhere. And so there's one on this line and there's one on the green

Speaker 2  1:21:54
table. And then can you so are you thinking you would would add another line item like so when Drew calculates the interest and shows that, would that show up as another line item, or would it simply be investment plus interest earned, and then another, like a grant total at the bottom? Now, you probably have your journal entry done before you print this, showing the interest earned, right?

Speaker 5  1:22:16
It would need to be on there. Yeah.

Speaker 1  1:22:19
Never mind. This would calculate the interest earned. The weird thing is, as soon as you add an entry for 531, 21 your balance is going to go up and your payment is going to be a penny less, or whatever it is from the check that you're writing. Then, so whatever. Well,

Speaker 5  1:22:38
do we do? We need to write the interest? No, be best to expense the interest during the quarter?

Unknown Speaker  1:22:50
Yeah, on the last day of the quarter, right?

Speaker 5  1:22:52
I'm just we would solve that problem there if we could write it the next day as the beginning of the but

Speaker 1  1:23:02
were you could say that you don't start earning interest until, until starting next day, which means, if you deposit $20,000 you don't earn interest on that, like Jay may not Start earning interest on this until the first

Unknown Speaker  1:23:21
Right. Right?

Speaker 5  1:23:29
That would, that would solve the problem here, I don't know. Is that the proper way to do things? Is it not the proper way? I don't know. Investment guru. I mean,

Speaker 2  1:23:40
I think the important thing here is that the numbers that that the rounding is done, so the numbers add up. So if you look at your your interest earned, we add that up, that it all adds up. We don't want two, you know, two cents. If somebody does the math with a calculator and says, Oh, I got chip two cents, then we don't want that like it, it, we need to make sure the rounding all totals up. I think other than that, it's,

Speaker 1  1:24:07
I mean, we can show fractions, fractional sense. We could show it to the 1000s of a penny.

Unknown Speaker  1:24:17
Um, and kind of solve that, solve

Unknown Speaker  1:24:21
that. Maybe that might, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:24:26
I think we're good with I mean, good with that.

Speaker 2  1:24:30
The can you take away the detail screen? Yeah, wording over there? Oh, I'm

Unknown Speaker  1:24:34
sorry, yeah, I wanted to do this. I

Unknown Speaker  1:24:47
I don't put it on the date. I guess

Unknown Speaker  1:24:57
you probably want to switch investment and draw. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:25:06
oh, I don't know.

Speaker 5  1:25:12
I mean, is it going to make more sense to them? To me, it's going to make sense if we actually have them in debit, credit order, but

Speaker 2  1:25:21
that's all like a checkbook. Yeah, that's how I checked

Unknown Speaker  1:25:28
over. By the way, the

Speaker 1  1:25:35
interest payments are not going to show up here if it's not reinvested, which is correct,

Unknown Speaker  1:25:41
right? Okay.

Speaker 2  1:25:47
Oh, now you're okay. So, so I don't know if you want to do this now or just later, but I'm curious, like the balance and the the interest earned, the interest earned will only show

Speaker 5  1:25:59
well, okay, no, so what I was doing is I was applying it and then I was drawing it for my check. So if this guy would receive a check for his interest, there would be another line as a draw for 382, 18,

Speaker 2  1:26:19
oh, you show the interest as an investment and then a draw again, to

Speaker 5  1:26:24
take it on that way, it showed up on the, you know, as the history of the of the account.

Speaker 5  1:26:36
And it's just same day, so it doesn't change calculation at all.

Unknown Speaker  1:26:49
Sorry, one more I

Unknown Speaker  1:26:53
apologize. One more time.

Unknown Speaker  1:26:57
What I'm sorry.

Speaker 1  1:26:58
What can you run that. I apologize. I got distracted.

Speaker 5  1:27:02
So what I was doing, what I was doing is this guy doesn't get paid out, so it just compounds. So it's an investment. If he were paid out, then I would there would be another transaction as a draw for 382, 18, like for all of them, I create the interest investment so that it shows up in the history of the account. And then I create draws for the guys that get paid out.

Speaker 1  1:27:32
Got it, okay, well, that's, that's great. I mean, in that case, so in that case, they would have two line items. One is, one is, is the investment for interest paid. The other would be a draw, paying the interest back out. Yeah,

Speaker 5  1:27:54
good. They're the same date, so it's not going to change our our balance and all that. Right?

Speaker 2  1:28:03
Okay. Now I want, no, that's so, so true. What you would do is, once this is done, you would run the reports, then you'd see at the bottom the interest earned for that order. Then you make all those journal entries. Then you'd run this. You'd run these reports again, so they now show the journal entries, and then you kind of all put them in envelopes, and away you

Speaker 1  1:28:25
go. Okay, but if you want to avoid questions, if you dated on the 31st with with end of day balances, you're going to show a discrepancy between what you paid them and the interest that they earned. No because it would be dated on the you would withdra that back out. Never mind. Okay, for the people who compound, you generate the interest amount, then you market an investment in the last day of the period, which is going to increase the like, let me show you. This was the Excel one. So this one's, this guy's interest payment was, was 350 now, if I, if he actually held now, if I put this 350 straight back in there, then he actually had a 30,033 $50 balance for one day. He actually held this for 29 days. So in this case, my new interest rate, you should get paid three $50.06 and so they're going to see that, and they're like, what happened with my six cents? Makes sense.

Speaker 5  1:29:44
So, and what you were saying is, if we make it, if we make investments, calculate the next day, starting the next day, that would solve this, right, correct? Yeah.

Speaker 1  1:30:00
Which means that on a sorry point o6, divided by No, divided by 365, which means that somebody is going to lose, you're going to, you're going to shortchange somebody by the $5 that they're owed on the day that they deposited their

Unknown Speaker  1:30:18
their investment. I

Unknown Speaker  1:30:27
How did you

Unknown Speaker  1:30:29
How was it handled? On your calculation?

Speaker 5  1:30:38
I don't know. I'd have to go figure it out, my estimation is that this is probably more correct than what has been used. I mean, I'm using the template from Whitney, and it goes by the days in so you there was a $10,000 investment and that was in for, yeah, the 29 days the period. I think it's pretty much just that. I think it was just not downtown because, because it was done in Excel. And then you go create your entry, and Excel doesn't know about that. There was a last day investment,

Unknown Speaker  1:31:35
I'm pretty sure so

Unknown Speaker  1:31:37
is there? Is it wrong to just

Speaker 2  1:31:40
calculate the interest on 30,000 you're and now we're basically saying you're $350 of interest earnings does not you don't start to earn that. You don't earn interest on that until day one of until the following day. It's basically what we believe was at

Speaker 1  1:32:02
That's correct. And the question is, are we can we apply that same rule to big investments as well? We write a check for $20,000 we deposit it. You don't start collecting interest until the following day. Well,

Speaker 2  1:32:21
again, I'm not a banker, I don't know, but I'd say that's perfectly fine, the logic. So, so with if you do that, then your columns where you're showing date dates like days interest earned, or days balance held in days balance held in period. So something deposited on 531 and let's say this is the end of the period. Is 531 then you would say that's zero days.

Speaker 1  1:32:46
Yeah, I think what you might want to do is something like this. I don't know if this is it, but

Unknown Speaker  1:32:55
I would just to clear up confusion. Transaction Date. Here's the effective date, the effective date, after the investment, before the balance, but here's the transaction date. Good.

Speaker 2  1:33:18
Should we say Transaction Date. Should we instead say deposit date? That's always going to be deposit date. Well, here's

Speaker 8  1:33:26
one able style, and then here's the raw modern style. We did pass this, but in your well, if

Unknown Speaker  1:33:33
it's a draw, it's also the check date. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:33:41
is this is,

Unknown Speaker  1:33:49
I don't know.

Speaker 2  1:33:51
I almost think taking the effective date column out and just showing days held in period, balance held in period, you just subtract one there. If everybody you know, if somebody ever asked a question, then you

Unknown Speaker  1:34:04
say, What's I

Speaker 2  1:34:06
almost feel like that would be less confusing than having to date columns. But what do you think?

Unknown Speaker  1:34:20
Yeah, I mean,

Unknown Speaker  1:34:24
I think that works.

Unknown Speaker  1:34:27
I mean, that's based on I don't, I don't know if that's the normal people's investments or not, but

Speaker 1  1:34:36
I don't know if there's a right or a wrong way. I think there's a here's the expectation. Here's how we're going to pay you. Do you agree or disagree? And if these guys are quibbling over a $5 loss, anytime they make the investment, just ask them if they would like to cover the interest for the first day and they can invest $5 more. Like,

Speaker 2  1:34:56
yeah, I agree. I think. I think. This was more. We won't lose anybody because of this.

Speaker 1  1:35:09
I think it's usable too. Sorry. You can one more thing, if you really need to make an argument, it's not going to post to your bank account until the day after you deposit. Anyway, I know so

Speaker 5  1:35:22
not usable by us until that day. Anyway, right?

Speaker 1  1:35:28
I like it. I can. I'll spec this out. And I'm pretty sure this is something that Jonathan can just put his head down and figure out how to make it happen. And, yes,

Speaker 2  1:35:40
so an ETA on it is what, like two weeks you're thinking, or gonna

Speaker 1  1:35:45
guess something like that. I don't know if we're gonna do Yeah. Sometimes it just depends on what his workload is. Sometimes he picks up out pretty fast.

Speaker 2  1:35:55
But Well, if you see that it's going to go late, let us know. Because so that we can what we don't want is on July 4, say, I got pushed out. I don't expect it to happen. It's basically and then we have to scramble and try to do something in our site.

Speaker 1  1:36:13
Okay, well, let me, let me come from something. He can do this as a we can start this as a user report, and I will send a note to him and tell him that if he doesn't believe he can get to by July 1 or by end of June. Please, please let us know so we can.

Unknown Speaker  1:36:36
Yeah, great. Good.

Speaker 2  1:36:39
I like it. This is good. Should we the afternoon call? Do we need that? Or do we not need it?

Speaker 1  1:36:50
I don't need it. I could use it for wrapping up. I mean, just straight up working on this stuff. So okay, but let's do that good.

Speaker 2  1:37:01
So we'll cancel that call and take the time to work.

Speaker 4  1:37:07
All right. Good. Thank you. See you. Then bye.
