Unknown Speaker  00:42
To work.

Unknown Speaker  01:20
Rocky, Hallowed, hello.

Speaker 1  01:23
Finally, around, I plugged my headset in over the weekend, and I did not so I'm sitting close to my PC so my little cord reaches

Unknown Speaker  01:33
very Is it

Matthias Miller  01:37
a standard cable, or

Unknown Speaker  01:40
is it like a special USB C.

Matthias Miller  01:43
Oh, well, they make

Speaker 1  01:44
like I don't I know they have long ones. I thought I had one here. The only one I'm seeing is short.

Speaker 2  01:54
Well, let me here. Give me 20 seconds, my backpack. I

Unknown Speaker  02:50
Yeah, no luck. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  02:58
where do you want to start?

Matthias Miller  03:01
Let's just pop into the proposal. I don't mean to run, yeah, why don't you run?

Unknown Speaker  03:17
I tried to

Unknown Speaker  03:20
hop on Zoom a second time instead of going To the proposal

Unknown Speaker  03:26
like that'll work very well.

Unknown Speaker  03:32
Okay.

Speaker 2  03:40
Okay. All right,

Unknown Speaker  03:51
contract definitions, contracts products are some of the main places I think.

Matthias Miller  04:06
Sorry, what were they again?

Unknown Speaker  04:09
I mean, sort of the contract definitions, contracts and products

Matthias Miller  04:15
start with contract definition,

Unknown Speaker  04:34
share my own screen.

Speaker 1  05:06
I don't even know how close these are to each other or not,

Unknown Speaker  05:14
suspect we've got

Speaker 1  05:32
Okay, so NSF, that's just don't need to do that yet, right?

Matthias Miller  05:39
Do we know there's an NSF fee on here. There is, we haven't talked about how to apply the NSF fee, right? So that would be a to do. How to apply it.

Speaker 1  05:58
Yes, probably wouldn't go to the contract definition, but that in contract,

Unknown Speaker  06:09
yeah, that would make sense,

Unknown Speaker  06:18
like we've done with everything else. Pounds, okay, payment cycles. Have we nailed down how we're handling over and under payments?

Matthias Miller  06:32
I think so. I mean, we're floating due dates,

Speaker 1  06:45
yeah, are we always doing floating due dates?

Matthias Miller  06:51
No, I mean, there's a, there's a there's going to be a fixed versus floating, okay, if there's not yet, I

Unknown Speaker  07:18
contract tapes. I think this is working. Are

Matthias Miller  07:32
you simultaneously double checking that the detail screen actually matches?

Speaker 1  07:36
I'm not keeping I'm trying to, I'm not going super, super careful on like RG, sorting and stuff, but just that fields and stuff are the same. Then we have the rent to own financials, which is the terms and length, cash price, rental fee, divisor, requires balloon payment, minimum price, percent of

Matthias Miller  08:04
we're not handling. We don't have the,

Unknown Speaker  08:09
okay, well, yeah, man, like, what?

Matthias Miller  08:12
We're not actually applying balloon payments yet, right? Which goes to the contract, which goes contract? I

Speaker 1  08:28
we have, we have bounty house payments along as the balloon payments,

Matthias Miller  08:32
exactly, just tickets and wristbands. That's all you get. I it

Unknown Speaker  08:43
Okay, minimum down payment.

Speaker 1  08:59
Oh, I think you thought these guys were, these are MRG, I guess

Matthias Miller  09:08
I'm going to assume or they should be,

Speaker 1  09:15
yeah, but we need to make that clear, right? Um,

Speaker 1  09:28
I just add a label above it, above these two, that was your thinking.

Matthias Miller  09:34
I wish I had a better, I mean, a better solution. I don't really, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  09:41
May, I think we go with that for now, and if we come on exploring, this is a

Unknown Speaker  09:55
village reduced. SAS,

Unknown Speaker  09:58
my own comment about it.

Unknown Speaker  10:03
Now I gave this change to Sean,

Unknown Speaker  10:10
Sean Rick

Speaker 1  10:13
once he's back in, which reminds me, I should message the chat that he's not in today either.

Matthias Miller  10:19
Yeah, I already had a proposed table.

Unknown Speaker  10:21
That's insane.

Matthias Miller  10:26
I know. Thanks. I forget that a lot, but never enough.

Speaker 1  10:33
I want one minute to message the code drafters USA chat saying, Yep, Sean is i

Unknown Speaker  11:07
Okay, rental fees,

Unknown Speaker  11:12
well, this is very different

Matthias Miller  11:16
fee type,

Unknown Speaker  11:19
like repayment cycle. We don't have

Unknown Speaker  11:25
B type is there,

Speaker 1  11:29
except it's only late fee right now. Damage Waiver is down here.

Unknown Speaker  11:35
I thought Damage Waiver, it's not.

Matthias Miller  11:38
It used to be way up top, and then we said, look, it's not that different than anything else that we're doing. So why don't we just

Speaker 1  11:46
or these other so why is, why is this? Why do we have Damage Waiver down here and not in here?

Matthias Miller  11:58
Because it's the same thing. So because damage waivers a monthly fee, there is no grace period. It's just you need to pay it. Right? The reason we have an RG for late fees, which you could argue, do we actually need that? Or should we just have a I mean, I think you can argue you should, but the repayment cycle really is like weekly late fees

Unknown Speaker  12:29
versus monthly fees. So then shouldn't we? Shouldn't the

Speaker 1  12:36
fee type? Well, I guess we could be type is irrelevant. I know that's what I was thinking. Shouldn't I would label this as a late fee? RG, somehow,

Unknown Speaker  12:47
yes, just

Matthias Miller  12:48
put a label above it. I mean, maybe just change rental fees to late fees and put a section in for other fees.

Unknown Speaker  12:55
Sure. Yes, 100%

Unknown Speaker  13:01
do Sean change

Speaker 1  13:05
rename rental fees section to relate fees? I think I want to actually create a PC. Oh, there you go. It'll be easier. I

Unknown Speaker  13:24
Oh, here's the

Unknown Speaker  13:29
it's not the hierarchy view, but anyway,

Matthias Miller  13:40
while you're doing that, let it be known that switching brands of barefoot shoes is a royal pain. Oh, sorry. They have an automatic sizer, and it was off by a complete size. And so I'm sending back my I got twelves,

Speaker 1  14:04
barefoot shoes the wrong size. Sound worse than other shoes the wrong size.

Matthias Miller  14:07
It was like I couldn't I only wore them Sundays, and so I didn't realize how bad they were until I went to the expo. I was I was genuinely in pain. I didn't have any other shoes to wear.

Unknown Speaker  14:17
Oh, it was not cool. What do you wear?

Matthias Miller  14:20
I've been wearing flip flops. All my friends are joking about me being on the slippery slope and expecting me to go around barefoot soon. So

Unknown Speaker  14:34
man, are you searching to Hawaiian shirts soon to the office.

Matthias Miller  14:42
I don't know if my stereotypes are right. That is hilarious, though. Doesn't matter if they're right, if it's funny, exactly,

Speaker 1  14:54
relatable error messages, relatable the error. Fields,

Unknown Speaker  15:04
the Matthias is spec

Unknown Speaker  15:32
dice.

Speaker 1  15:34
I know this is my favorite, my favorite thing that I figured out yet in design, I think okay, label error, fields

Speaker 2  15:48
Change, rename, separate the rental fees section into two sections.

Speaker 1  16:03
Rental, late fees, other fees,

Unknown Speaker  16:10
remove the B

Unknown Speaker  16:16
type field from the first

Unknown Speaker  16:18
star gene so

Unknown Speaker  16:29
fees.

Unknown Speaker  16:32
Need to add the field.

Matthias Miller  16:35
Do we? Do we have a list? Do we have the list?

Unknown Speaker  16:38
It's not one that I'm familiar with,

Matthias Miller  16:45
maybe a weekly or monthly list in the catalog,

Unknown Speaker  16:49
just weekly or monthly I think,

Speaker 1  16:57
can't we do? What's it? What are like, semi monthly payments and stuff?

Unknown Speaker  17:03
Oh,

Unknown Speaker  17:05
it's going to happen there. We're

Matthias Miller  17:09
going to have different late fee calculations. I don't know.

Speaker 1  17:16
We have a payment terms list, bi weekly, monthly, semi monthly. Well, why don't we get weekly first there, please.

Matthias Miller  17:27
Sorry, why don't we? Oh,

Speaker 1  17:28
it's bi weekly monthly, then semi monthly weekly is semi monthly. The rate semi monthly would be every two weeks, and bi weekly is every two weeks, right?

Unknown Speaker  17:44
Weekly definition of semi once, oh, it is yeah, twice a month.

Unknown Speaker  17:53
Yeah, just wrong.

Matthias Miller  17:55
No, once first in the 15th or something like that, yeah?

Speaker 1  17:59
But what's the difference between that and bi weekly? Bi weekly, oh, bi weekly is literally every two weeks.

Matthias Miller  18:04
It's a difference of like, it is three days, three days a month, or something.

Unknown Speaker  18:08
Oh, blast things. Blessings on your head. Muzzle, top, muzzle, top, something

Speaker 1  18:16
like that. From anyway, didn't we sort this in some sensible fashion, instead of going bi weekly, monthly, semi monthly weekly, or are we trying to,

Matthias Miller  18:31
I would do monthly, semi monthly, bi weekly, weekly, or monthly weekly, semi monthly, bi weekly. I'm not sure which monthly seems to be like the most No, I would do monthly, semi monthly, weekly and bi weekly. But is bi monthly? One of those things where, like, biannual, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  19:01
monthly

Matthias Miller  19:04
is right? Bi monthly can mean every twice a month or every two months, right? Just just dumb. Welcome to the English language, semi monthly. But semi monthly is actually technically a word, one word, oh, I believe

Matthias Miller  19:27
does look like that as is bi weekly, like we don't need the dash in there. If somebody mispronounces it, that's their problem.

Unknown Speaker  19:49
This job needs to be closed when we have these long running jobs, it's a little

Unknown Speaker  19:58
little much. I.

Matthias Miller  20:09
It it's hard to maintain clarity and momentum. Yes,

Unknown Speaker  20:29
what? Why? Wouldn't

Unknown Speaker  20:31
Seth use this? I thought that's what it's called.

Unknown Speaker  20:34
I would just have a

Speaker 1  20:43
it's literally in the order we wanted. It was just offending instead of, unless you want weekly instead of bi

Matthias Miller  20:50
weekly, it makes what I have no idea which is more. Oh, but this was goes to least the previous way was from least the most frequent, right? Like it generally. I mean, I just, I don't, I don't think I like that. Just, I'm happy with that.

Unknown Speaker  21:16
So can we not use this for

Speaker 2  21:21
late fees. Late fees, I think we should. That's what I thought.

Unknown Speaker  21:31
Every payment cycle field, the late fees. Archie, i

Unknown Speaker  21:44
The list should be terms,

Unknown Speaker  21:53
payment cycle list of

Unknown Speaker  21:56
payment terms. Sean,

Unknown Speaker  22:14
account, size,

Speaker 1  22:22
okay, account flash contract we don't have

Unknown Speaker  23:12
grace period days we have. This is

Unknown Speaker  23:26
is this is required, presumably,

Unknown Speaker  23:28
should be yes,

Unknown Speaker  23:32
wired list of or

Unknown Speaker  23:41
just let's do that options. I

Matthias Miller  23:49
mean, it's very curious how this would work with per account. Does this actually belong in here, or should this be outside? DRG, because what do you do that's per account?

Speaker 1  24:07
Oh, yeah, and a bi weekly that's per contract.

Unknown Speaker  24:14
That's weird. And

Matthias Miller  24:18
is it per account per state? That's an answer. Well, that's got to be clarified.

Unknown Speaker  24:29
Okay, this guy, I

Speaker 1  24:44
to do. IDD, we think this field should be outside of the outside of the RG, how does it work? Is it her? Account, if it's per account, is it per account, per state? That enough?

Matthias Miller  25:11
Yeah, yes.

Speaker 1  25:14
And I think I'll have Sean add it as a non RG field for now.

Matthias Miller  25:18
I think it seems sane, or move it out of the RG.

Speaker 1  25:23
It's not in the RG, right now, late fee type, oh, it is in the RG.

Unknown Speaker  25:34
I'm blind, but now I see move late B type

Unknown Speaker  25:43
out of the erg.

Unknown Speaker  25:51
That is, keep it.

Unknown Speaker  25:56
That is, don't

Speaker 1  25:58
remove the field, but take it out of the RG, I feel like I'm being redundant, but I don't Want him to just nuke it.

Unknown Speaker  26:12
Method

Unknown Speaker  26:15
we have

Unknown Speaker  26:22
the E, mint V, Max fee

Unknown Speaker  26:24
tax.

Speaker 1  26:35
You want this labeled account slash contract, or are you fine with late fee type I'm going to go with like, Well,

Matthias Miller  26:44
no, it's, it's a, it's like a deduplication. But that's weird to say. I mean,

Unknown Speaker  26:59
so should I what do we call it?

Matthias Miller  27:09
All right, what are some bring ideas late fees apply to limit late fees. I

Matthias Miller  27:26
um, the weird thing is, then we're still going to apply it to a contract somewhere, somehow. I'm just not sure how. How do we want to even represent it? Uh, huh, it.

Speaker 1  27:47
Is it a state late fee requirement that it's, yeah, per account or per contract? Yeah. Can we call it something like that,

Matthias Miller  27:58
like, like a what I

Matthias Miller  28:04
I mean, instinctively I would say no because, I mean, just configure it so it can comply. We have other settings here, there that are regulating. I

Matthias Miller  28:28
What did we just call it? Apply to and then account and contract. I?

Matthias Miller  28:40
But, but then, if we do this, why don't we just make it a checkbox like

Unknown Speaker  28:51
where you can only check one or the other?

Matthias Miller  28:54
No, it's checkbox like limit late fees to one contract per period.

Matthias Miller  29:11
Isn't that this is me drinking my own kool aid on a Monday morning, but isn't that a lot? I think we should run it past Duane, but to me, that's a lot simpler. And then we're free to say, yeah. We just pick an arbitrary, arbitrary contract. And if you forgive one contract, you might actually, you know, you might be forgiving multiple. You do not our problem. Yeah, you said limit.

Speaker 1  29:40
Limit. Late Fee to one one

Matthias Miller  29:44
per period.

Unknown Speaker  29:50
That's a doozy of a name, but I think you're right. I.

Matthias Miller  30:38
Yeah, yeah, we either probably run it passed away into kit,

Speaker 1  30:46
so I should wait to have him code this, yeah, yeah, I think so, and I have him kill the other field for now, yeah, I think we have it tied

Unknown Speaker  30:55
in anyway, Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  30:58
okay, dwf short code, I think we're using, yep.

Matthias Miller  31:06
What is the tap? Remind me of the tax on the late fee drop list.

Unknown Speaker  31:11
I think it's like, non taxable, and then remove from your at,

Unknown Speaker  31:29
the freezing the values On the contracts probably needs to be SPECT yet to

Matthias Miller  31:43
take, yeah, no idea which. If that's actually done,

Unknown Speaker  31:50
we leave

Unknown Speaker  31:52
that for now. Or do you want to work

Matthias Miller  31:53
on that now? Let's leave it

Unknown Speaker  31:58
other fee type. I I believe you should not be in this list.

Unknown Speaker  32:05
No, it shouldn't be. Others.

Unknown Speaker  32:27
Late Fee

Unknown Speaker  32:28
should not be in the list. Yeah, help the list. So

Unknown Speaker  32:45
here so we have processing, delivery, redelivery,

Unknown Speaker  32:51
insulation, repossession, damage, waiver, accessible. Oh,

Speaker 1  32:59
right now, this is just a checkbox. Should this be the same sort as this or not?

Matthias Miller  33:10
I don't think it's nauseous.

Unknown Speaker  33:15
Is it fine? We never

Unknown Speaker  33:29
or added other fees are due to the contract.

Matthias Miller  33:32
I don't think it's necessary. But what could check with, sorry, using the list, yeah, because I don't think I think Leafy is the only one were you ever going to want to

Unknown Speaker  33:43
right, okay,

Matthias Miller  33:48
by the way, are you able to open app posting stuff like, what? Obviously, you saved the record

Unknown Speaker  33:57
here just like zch, yeah. I mean, yeah, it's

Matthias Miller  34:05
on my end. That's weird. Okay,

Speaker 1  34:13
good, so we need to figure out freezing these values on the contract. We apparently want another fees. RG, right.

Matthias Miller  34:24
We need a way to actually add these fees to the RG, somehow, I think we actually had a different methodology. That's a contract discussion. Yeah, so move that to the contract, and it's probably duplicate, but yeah, do

Speaker 1  34:35
you want, should like this also go on the contract? Or does this stay here? Or does it just this one line? I don't care about the freezing, but that line in particular is very clearly easy

Matthias Miller  34:48
to show from the payment record as other fees in the RG, I think that one might the next comment,

Unknown Speaker  34:55
these are, this is bogus anymore, right?

Matthias Miller  34:58
And the next one's bogus too. Oh

Unknown Speaker  35:01
Yeah, correct.

Unknown Speaker  35:06
Let's guys go

Unknown Speaker  35:07
down here as

Unknown Speaker  35:12
I could probably be,

Unknown Speaker  35:48
okay, This is

Unknown Speaker  35:54
ready for Sean.

Speaker 1  36:19
Me, Oh, if I rent to rent financials.

Speaker 1  36:43
This is the medical system. Alaska is going to have a rent to rent.

Unknown Speaker  36:54
Okay, so rent to rent currently has

Matthias Miller  37:00
early termination fee, it has a dwf.

Unknown Speaker  37:03
We don't need the dwf, right? Because it's in the RG, yeah. Oh, no, we

Unknown Speaker  37:16
never mind. Yep. I move

Unknown Speaker  37:28
and then

Speaker 1  37:30
credit card convenience fees. Are we wanting to add this now?

Unknown Speaker  37:38
Oh, I thought we had a hidden I

Unknown Speaker  37:46
yeah, I mean, we can, okay,

Unknown Speaker  37:49
is this presumably another catalog

Matthias Miller  37:53
I would probably do

Speaker 1  37:55
something like that, easiest way. And this is its own faction on the contract definition. Is this right? Yeah,

Speaker 1  38:18
I'm gonna say this. Is this fact enough that you're good if we try to

Unknown Speaker  38:23
add it, yeah, the basic

Matthias Miller  38:28
except for the Sure, yeah. And then the following payment methods get shipped. I think so. So, literally, it's a side note. Literally, go ahead, customers can say it's a debit card, and even if it is a credit card, we're none the wiser, and they won't get charged convenience fees, and it's just going to be a loophole.

Unknown Speaker  38:59
So

Speaker 1  39:02
does this? How does this tie in elsewhere? Is this only on the contract definition for now? It

Unknown Speaker  39:07
is for now and then. This determines

Matthias Miller  39:14
that's a good point. We need to it

Matthias Miller  39:20
needs to tie into the payment whiskey.

Unknown Speaker  39:23
Yeah, it does add.

Speaker 1  39:30
I'm going to put this one in my court for now, and if I get it, I should get it spiked out enough that they had it off. But it's just something I don't want to get built into the other one, and it wouldn't be a big deal. Let's add this in its catalog.

Speaker 1  40:01
So this, I'm going to just leave here. I have a job for it, so I'll get to

Unknown Speaker  40:20
it a EPO stuff.

Matthias Miller  40:26
We have an EPO method

Unknown Speaker  40:29
coded,

Unknown Speaker  40:30
right?

Matthias Miller  40:32
Here's the frustrating thing. These three methods are variable by pennies, like, oh my word it's all rounding like, how do you account for rounding stuff? Let's let me confirm

Unknown Speaker  40:52
with

Matthias Miller  40:54
feel like this needs to be confirmed with Dwayne. And I would like to know which method we actually coded.

Unknown Speaker  41:05
Do we only we only coded one method?

Unknown Speaker  41:08
Yes,

Speaker 1  41:24
so this guy is a to do IDD, s needs to confirm lane

Matthias Miller  41:39
that ready move this up in the top section somewhere, project management, yeah,

Speaker 1  41:52
you care where? No but at the bottom of your or is that too far back? That's fine. I I'll make it black, because everything else is black.

Unknown Speaker  42:16
Hey,

Unknown Speaker  42:25
you could have price increases, but,

Matthias Miller  42:30
oh, RTR, price increases, duh, what you're gonna lock in your price in perpetuity.

Unknown Speaker  42:42
It Dwayne,

Matthias Miller  42:44
yeah, this is rent to rent pricing. This is rent to rent, rent increases, ie, you know, X percent every year, or, you know, question mark, question mark, 80% Yeah, per year, yeah, we're rent sharks. Man, I'm sure there's some kind of state legislation that would, I hope so. I hope so people actually read their contracts.

Speaker 1  43:21
Oh, wow, I was oh, so convenience fees are not frozen on the contract.

Unknown Speaker  43:27
No, so

Matthias Miller  43:30
Well, actually, hang on. Then, why do we have an x 30 if it's not frozen?

Matthias Miller  43:40
I think we have a

Speaker 2  43:45
contradiction, but there should be frozen or not. Oh yeah, excuse me, I think the I think it should,

Matthias Miller  44:06
I think it should never be turned on until you run the x 30, but I think it should be turned off if you ever turn off the system switch.

Unknown Speaker  44:18
Sorry, what? Well,

Matthias Miller  44:23
I think if you, if you, maybe I should confirm this with Dwayne. It seems to me like you should never okay. If you turn on the, if we add the catalog for the convenience fees, I think you should have to manually run a button to say, Yep, I'm going to start charging this all the customers, because we don't know whether that was actually in their contract

Unknown Speaker  44:53
that way.

Matthias Miller  44:55
And secondly,

Unknown Speaker  44:56
so make it clear, so that the blame is very clearly on their head.

Matthias Miller  45:01
Yeah, right. And then if you remove, remove the catalog, we just stop it all together. And if you want to start, stop charging convenience fees, you just, you should turn it off the settings. And either new contracts will stop doing that, or or you run the x3 to terminal off.

Speaker 1  45:22
This system switch would only turn off if we did an actual system update for them.

Matthias Miller  45:28
Yep, this is considered a big, scary event, and only we'll have them sign a contract that says I know what I'm doing and I'm fully legally responsible for we take no blame, no blame.

Unknown Speaker  45:57
Okay,

Speaker 1  45:58
well, we potentially have times where so you want to make sure that,

Unknown Speaker  46:09
trying to track

Speaker 1  46:12
you're concerned that if they change settings, like to try to turn it off, just on the contract definition, that we give them a button that says this will actually go turn it off. Is that what you're saying?

Matthias Miller  46:25
Well, I think the checkbox should be something like enable convenience fees for all new contracts

Unknown Speaker  46:34
for all new

Matthias Miller  46:36
and then the button is updates. Well, if it's enabled, then it's then it's enable, enable convenience fees on existing contracts. And if it's unchecked, it's disabled, convenience fees for existing contracts.

Speaker 1  46:54
So basically, we have an you're we have a new field

Unknown Speaker  46:59
for the checkbox, right?

Unknown Speaker  47:06
Enabled. Well,

Matthias Miller  47:08
we have no we have the RG,

Unknown Speaker  47:12
hang on.

Matthias Miller  47:16
I don't think Dwayne and I know what we want, because we have an RG here. David, method, fee type,

Matthias Miller  47:29
hang on, no, we said it's not sort on the contract. Where does this comment about the button even come from?

Speaker 1  47:41
Don't know. Is it an old one? Let me do this. Do we remove the this section, this part of the comment, and remove the button, and then just are we scared that we're gonna start running on existing contracts? Is that the fear? Yeah.

Matthias Miller  48:03
I mean, well, I guess the question is not, we know we will depending how we design it, so that's not right. But the question is, do we need to when somebody turns on convenience fees? Do we need a way to that? It only applies to new contracts only. That's the question.

Unknown Speaker  48:21
I do IDD

Unknown Speaker  48:29
to me, You know what?

Unknown Speaker  48:30
I think this gets to be a child section.

Unknown Speaker  48:37
Look at you go, man, I know

Matthias Miller  48:41
stepping out of the long, rambly proposals. This

Speaker 1  48:45
one just makes a lot of sense for it to beat someone. Oh, perfect. It is its own thing very much. I like it. No way for

Matthias Miller  48:54
convenience fees to only be added slash removed to new contracts versus all existing contracts. I

Unknown Speaker  49:42
Okay,

Speaker 1  49:47
contract definitions, I think we're essentially done. I mean, we still have a few things to clean up. There's a couple to do, Dwayne's. Other than that, it's. Basically,

Unknown Speaker  50:00
oh,

Speaker 1  50:03
optional late fees. Do you want this to specify in here, in the project management plan that

Matthias Miller  50:18
needs to be on the contract record somewhere. Okay, it's something like, what would be the check box? Sorry, I'm sorry. The contract definition, I'm sorry, is contract definitions. It's a check box in the leafy section. That's something like,

Unknown Speaker  50:39
like the RG,

Matthias Miller  50:41
No, it'd be across all late fees. Okay,

Matthias Miller  50:59
a lot. I mean, okay, this is really dumb wording, so maybe you can one up me on this, please, but allow deferring late fees until end of contract, then

Matthias Miller  51:18
there's a question of, how do you want to represent this? Because if they incur a late fee every single month, fee every single month on the payment records,

Unknown Speaker  51:28
you're gonna have

Matthias Miller  51:30
3036 to 60 rows.

Unknown Speaker  51:33
Gracious.

Speaker 3  51:40
I Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  51:48
that's gonna be interesting.

Matthias Miller  51:53
So do you have a

Speaker 1  51:57
I do not have a better idea for naming, but so is that what you're wanting? Yeah, I mean, incredibly

Unknown Speaker  52:07
obtuse, but,

Matthias Miller  52:12
but then, I mean, there is this question of, how do you actually want to handle that? Because do you then just show a lump sum account, late fee, subtotal, close the contract. I think for now, we just do it the janky way, as Dwayne says, We gotta have someone, something, leave something for cool features after we're live.

Unknown Speaker  52:37
Oh, we're gonna have plenty of that, I think, yeah,

Matthias Miller  52:43
but then functionally, right? Because normally, we require you to pay the late fee first, before you you have to pay the entire period. Yeah, it's something like that. Use the robust wording. We can always change it. And then Jonathan needs to implement it in the payment whiskey, where you can keep paying contracts forward. You don't have to pay the late fee. I think you would still pay it by default, but it just wouldn't be required do

Unknown Speaker  53:24
which means I should be adding,

Speaker 1  53:34
system is interconnected.

Matthias Miller  53:38
Is very interconnected. Okay?

Unknown Speaker  53:55
Add a new field while deferring late, fees.

Speaker 1  54:12
This should be in the late fees Section, but not the RG.

Unknown Speaker  54:38
You shop

Unknown Speaker  54:59
okay, there's a lot. Of stuff that needs to be we're

Speaker 1  55:07
gonna have to go over. How everything's copied over. Does the copy happen? Are we expecting that's only through our contract entry process, which hasn't happened

Matthias Miller  55:18
yet? Yeah, there's a checkbox, I thought that updates.

Speaker 1  55:21
That's true. Do we want that's what I had initially added? Do we want to keep

Matthias Miller  55:25
that? I think so. To me, that's the most modular, reusable

Speaker 1  55:30
way to do it. It's true. Which issue good? Should it be an on Change button? Then so that we can, well, no, if it's checkbox, we can hit that from a x 30x, 30.

Matthias Miller  55:45
Yeah, that's what I would think.

Unknown Speaker  55:48
I'm going to

Speaker 1  55:52
add a child to the contracts job, assign it to me to figure out what we need to be copying over in art.

Unknown Speaker  55:58
Is there?

Matthias Miller  56:02
I think the answer is no.

Matthias Miller  56:09
But there is a part of me that really wishes for there's I think I hate this, but what if? What if the contract definition and the contract were both the same record level? I called

Speaker 1  56:37
it, I guess, guessing. That's what you're gonna say. It's so Josh is done with some stuff in zfv.

Matthias Miller  56:45
Then, yeah, where it's almost like a building, right? And then you literally could

Speaker 1  56:56
you share a base detail screen

Unknown Speaker  57:02
with all the settings, right?

Matthias Miller  57:04
So literally, you're just copying and then, yes, you need to enumerate all the fields in your copy, which is weird. Do you Well, when you need to refresh, if you ever need to refresh it from the oh,

Speaker 1  57:20
that way. So this would simplify the initial Well, the first time you create it, but not after that. Is that what you can right?

Matthias Miller  57:33
It would also mean you always have one.

Speaker 1  57:37
You always add stuff. You're not having

Matthias Miller  57:40
to double add stuff, but it does mean that you can accidentally. It does mean you have to it well, and the data model is always right, and then when you change the right, and then you only do migrations in one place. The downside is that on the contract def, you have to be careful that you don't accidentally reference actual contract stuff. And vice versa or not vice versa. But what do you mean on the contract definition?

Unknown Speaker  58:07
I mean, don't

Matthias Miller  58:09
do something stupid, like, like, we're not going to validate against Well, there's a few things. One, when you create reports, you to make sure to Yeah, which is confusing for end users who are writing reports, but it is pretty confusing.

Speaker 1  58:28
I feel like that's a big enough change. We should ask Dwayne, because he cares about how easy it is for people to write report, doesn't he?

Matthias Miller  58:37
Yeah, I kind of think we

Speaker 1  58:40
like, I like the idea, but it also I also don't. I

Matthias Miller  58:45
know I'm kind of the same way. I

Speaker 1  58:49
mean, I love it from a data model perspective, and if it was just us doing report development, that I wouldn't care. Okay, yeah, I have

Matthias Miller  58:59
another bonkers idea, okay, what if you have a way? What if you still have a contract and a contract definition, uh huh, but you have a general contract definition, which is what people visibly see, and then you have a per contract definition, and then you have macros on the contract. So, so you say, go look at the definition record for my contract, nem ID, and get me this field off of it.

Unknown Speaker  59:38
Does that make sense? No, I'm not tracking, sorry.

Matthias Miller  59:41
Okay, so instead of creating fields, okay, so okay, you have the contract definition and the contract, but instead of adding special contract definition fields to the contract, you say, no, no, it's actually going to live on a separate record. I'm going to take the contract definition, I'm going to copy it, I'm going to assign my contracts ID to it, to link. Get so you have a contract specific definition,

Speaker 1  1:00:08
as users will never, probably never be creating reports off of contract definitions.

Matthias Miller  1:00:13
Very unlikely, extremely unlikely, right?

Speaker 2  1:00:20
But hmm, but even if they do, you know, go ahead, okay, what that?

Speaker 1  1:00:33
What that says us is duplicating the fielding, what that costs us is needed. You can't look up those values every time,

Matthias Miller  1:00:51
yes, and you can't do field changes, or you can't write indexes based on contract information fields and okay, I tried,

Speaker 1  1:01:04
you tried. It was a good idea, but it wasn't fully

Matthias Miller  1:01:09
baked. It's well, it was a good idea with, you know, debilitating limitations. So besides that, it was excellent.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:18
It's okay, you can be honest.

Speaker 3  1:01:20
Ah. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:01:29
good, yeah, so I'm

Speaker 1  1:01:36
I'm just assigning a job to myself to review what stuff is cached and make sure

Unknown Speaker  1:01:41
we're where we should be. I like it,

Speaker 1  1:01:46
because I think it's mainly specked out through here, and I'll probably have couple questions then when I actually go through that, but we don't have to. I don't think it's worth us going through right now.

Matthias Miller  1:02:04
That's, I think that's fair. Oh boy. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  1:02:16
So do we want

Speaker 1  1:02:18
to look at the contract record? Do you want to look at the contract record. You want to look at the product trick first, because it's easier.

Matthias Miller  1:02:30
That is, contract is the next. Let's do contract. We're gonna we're gonna go, we're gonna do the you know, Brian Tracy, eat the frog, cure your biggest headache. I don't know what I'm feeling. You're feeling

Unknown Speaker  1:02:50
awake, alert, alive, no,

Matthias Miller  1:02:51
we're just feeling like for punishment. I don't know

Unknown Speaker  1:02:59
where do we even start?

Unknown Speaker  1:03:03
Start at the beginning, a very good place to start.

Matthias Miller  1:03:14
So helpful. You're welcome. I feel like I've gotten so much clearer. Yeah, ready?

Speaker 2  1:03:22
Oh, hey,

Unknown Speaker  1:03:31
this is still a To Do. Sean, is

Matthias Miller  1:03:33
there a product change for it? Think so. Because

Speaker 1  1:03:42
I think my to do after the call is to close out this contracts job, and we can have later parts. What is, what if I literally close it out right now?

Matthias Miller  1:03:57
Is there stuff that's undone on it?

Speaker 1  1:03:59
Well, okay, what we're going to do is we're going to, I think what I want to do is just copy it over to a main contracts job, as in the to do's, and we can all sort through it Then after the call.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:12
Yeah, but I think it's I

Unknown Speaker  1:04:26
and then,

Unknown Speaker  1:04:28
because somehow it just it gets hard for me to keep going on it when it gets so

Unknown Speaker  1:04:35
huge. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:04:39
closing, this was the first

Unknown Speaker  1:04:43
contracts

Unknown Speaker  1:04:47
moved a

Speaker 3  1:04:48
bunch use to

Unknown Speaker  1:04:52
new umbrella so.

Speaker 1  1:05:04
Then I love that I'm reviewing this as individual one and individual two. I

Speaker 1  1:05:34
Okay, so then this guy, I'm going to create a child job

Unknown Speaker  1:05:40
on tracks, add helpful lookup macros. YouTube is just

Unknown Speaker  1:05:53
never endingly growing

Unknown Speaker  1:05:56
well job security.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:15
Okay, so that then is Q.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:22
This copy the product changer.

Speaker 1  1:06:39
They're joking over there that I don't program anymore. I'm just it's getting closer to true than I would quite wish.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:49
But you wish

Matthias Miller  1:06:52
I understand, Okay, sweet,

Speaker 1  1:06:57
things are just better about the world that now that this is that first contract job is done,

Matthias Miller  1:07:04
isn't it amazing what happens?

Speaker 1  1:07:06
Yeah, well, there's not a big 199 BMF job floating around under 99 revision job, right.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:16
Anyway, okay, good. All right,

Matthias Miller  1:07:23
that's in y'all's court. Yeah, I feel like, I feel like there's going to be, there is going to be a wrap of stuff around contract design, yeah, and I almost wonder if we should push it. Can we create a new section up top, or let's, let's put it the top of the contract. We can move it later. Can move it later, or

Unknown Speaker  1:07:44
something that's just seeing this scenario down here. God gets building. I'm pretty sure that's some of your

Matthias Miller  1:07:57
your handiwork. I

Speaker 1  1:08:05
Okay, so you're saying, just put your thinking, have a big section up here of design that needs to happen.

Matthias Miller  1:08:14
Yeah, I think so let's start with that, and then we can move it. I

Unknown Speaker  1:08:27
Okay, this guy looks like a bit of a confusion

Matthias Miller  1:08:36
override due date always for the earliest period. I don't think we need handle forgiveness and late fees in the next 30 I don't know what the override due date means. Do we handle the due date override? Let me ask Jonathan.

Speaker 1  1:08:53
Jonathan, do we handle safety override at all? We don't

Unknown Speaker  1:09:02
want the whiskey side at least.

Matthias Miller  1:09:04
Well, okay, so we need a, we need a to do, to handle that.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:10
I'm going to I'm

Speaker 1  1:09:20
for now, I'm going to be putting some stuff here, because I'm not sure where else to put it, sure, and we can clean it up then, but this will help, I think, overriding, um,

Unknown Speaker  1:09:44
um, always for the earliest unpaid period.

Matthias Miller  1:09:49
Yeah, when you override a due date, you can't, you can't change the due date. You can't have unpaid period. Unpaid period, okay, March was the page. Oh. Right? Yeah, it was a paid and then let's move the May thing,

Speaker 1  1:10:03
delay, whatever only override the due date for the the earliest unpaid period, right? These guys, elite can have it up there.

Speaker 2  1:10:19
Forgive me fees. Yeah, so

Unknown Speaker  1:10:26
x 30

Matthias Miller  1:10:27
Yes. We need an X 30 button that's called Forgive, and you prompt for a fee type and an amount. We have x 30 validation to make sure that we won't over forgive. I assume

Unknown Speaker  1:10:40
30 button

Unknown Speaker  1:10:43
label, hold forgive.

Speaker 1  1:10:47
Is why they say handle late fees as well. Is that to forgive?

Matthias Miller  1:10:52
Well, theoretically, if you wait, why would that? I don't know why that's related to forgiveness. Can you incur a late fee because of forgiveness? No, it's forgiven.

Speaker 1  1:11:04
Like, yeah, that's there. Yeah. Forgive the oldest news based on not for fee, type and amount. Well, actually,

Matthias Miller  1:11:19
and I don't, I don't think we actually have to validate you, just it would be really nice. Is there a good way to show the the the outstanding fee amount? I mean,

Speaker 1  1:11:37
we could pretty easily sum the rows for the type. That's not hard.

Matthias Miller  1:11:44
And then would you throw it the show at the drop list so it show late fees, Dash $14.97 or, how would you model that?

Unknown Speaker  1:11:57
Because you

Speaker 1  1:11:59
we can't easily show it in the press. Can we what?

Matthias Miller  1:12:03
Can we know this isn't a, I mean, it's an X 30 button, right?

Speaker 1  1:12:08
What I'm saying is, could you, if you pass in the contract ID, you could look up, you could show just a label, couldn't you? Yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:12:23
with the amounts for all of them,

Speaker 1  1:12:25
they're just the total amount. But you might be you're saying giving, there's a whole bunch of different fee types. You can forgive

Matthias Miller  1:12:33
a processing fee, right, right?

Unknown Speaker  1:12:37
So if you set the I see, I see,

Unknown Speaker  1:12:42
I see, sorry,

Unknown Speaker  1:12:50
focus, see, that's where,

Matthias Miller  1:12:56
if you would throw it In the drop list, like, you know, fee, forgiveness, dash balance of 1573 retrievals, or, you know, redelivery, $50 processing $25 and then you would see what it actually is. And then the amount you would put in the amount

Speaker 1  1:13:18
you default the amount when you set the fee. I mean, you can't do that, though. Wait, here's an idea.

Matthias Miller  1:13:28
Yes, here's the idea, can you do these, these level of dependencies? Actually, I don't think you can. You can't have a Dependent List, box dependent on something else. But if you could, you would pass in the contract ID, you choose the fee type. No, it's easy. It is easy. You have a fee type that's all fees, and then you select the fee type, then you have a secondary drop list with the amount, which is the full amount or the remaining balance, and other like dollar $14, or 1473 73 full balance or other, and then the other makes a editable box pop up, and you put in the other amount.

Speaker 1  1:14:10
I'm not sure you can have a macro that's or an aspen that's visible, dependent on a sometimes visible aspect, like I don't think you can go multi layers on that. But maybe

Matthias Miller  1:14:21
you know you can't do you don't need to go multi layers. The fee type is always showing all available fee types.

Speaker 1  1:14:28
Oh, so you're not limiting it for the contract.

Speaker 2  1:14:32
No, gotcha.

Matthias Miller  1:14:40
So anyway, I would argue putting it all into the single list of fee types, any fee types with an outstanding balance, that's really the way to do it, I think. So we don't default it. And if you can't type the number twice, we'll just say it's a confirmation that you for sure forgive the right amount. And who cares? And also, we don't actually need validation that you don't over forgive. We'll just, you can't forgive more than the fee, and we'll just forgive up to the fee and quietly keep going. I think, I don't know, argue with me. You want to add validation? I don't care. I would prefer to for paper trail, validate.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:30
Don't spend lots

Speaker 1  1:15:33
of time on this, but see if you can add validation if they try to forgive more than the

Unknown Speaker  1:15:44
scanty

Unknown Speaker  1:15:47
amounts, The amount for

Unknown Speaker  1:15:55
fee type, all

Unknown Speaker  1:16:02
is it all overdue?

Speaker 2  1:16:05
Yeah, well, outstanding, well,

Unknown Speaker  1:16:12
except not rental.

Matthias Miller  1:16:16
No, you can't forgive rental fees. You can defer it, or you could override the cash payoff. Or, I don't know what that's weird. I don't even know if you can forgive dwf. You should maybe ask,

Speaker 1  1:16:36
that's it. Yeah, IDD can. I don't have to put it to do IDD by each of these. No, you don't do like you get a

Matthias Miller  1:16:44
bullet a piece the former. Lauren, Lauren, great uncle. Your great uncle. Lauren's co executive director was a guy by the name of Levi summers, the most incredible man. He's just a great dude. He would, he would refer to these bullets as peace dots. Dot, not a bullet. We're, you know, in the realm of, you know, pessimism, if you're looking to be

Unknown Speaker  1:17:19
great, that's great.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:26
Okay, sweet. I'm

Unknown Speaker  1:17:30
going to move this comment up to the dev section, and I'm going

Speaker 1  1:17:41
to have to come through and create product changes for these Sure, I have to figure out how much I want to how much we want the number of product changes to balloon or to lump stuff together.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:56
That's another question. Yep,

Unknown Speaker  1:18:04
main detail screen show calculated next due date. Aren't we showing that

Unknown Speaker  1:18:12
maybe we're not. Okay, fine, we're not.

Matthias Miller  1:18:19
It's not even if you scroll down. No, I guess not. If you're searching useful to do,

Unknown Speaker  1:18:28
possibly I'm

Unknown Speaker  1:18:48
Do you still want?

Matthias Miller  1:18:50
Yeah, that needs to go up there.

Unknown Speaker  1:19:01
Go on. And

Speaker 1  1:19:03
then how to apply NSFs as well. Yes, kind of like having check boxes. It makes it easier to see what's done or not. All good. Then balloon payments, yep.

Unknown Speaker  1:19:27
Formatting is amazing. Is it still to do IDD, or do you figure out how to or is this a depth thing?

Matthias Miller  1:19:40
Oh, yeah, we need to wait. Well,

Matthias Miller  1:19:50
should it be that, or should it be next 30 button, ad fee?

Unknown Speaker  1:19:55
I don't hate that. I

Matthias Miller  1:19:58
wonder we could do an ad fee. And then you have a drop list of fee types, and then you have dwf just shouldn't be done, like, that's rental fee, and dwf, again, should

Unknown Speaker  1:20:06
not right, right? But

Matthias Miller  1:20:09
anything else, go ahead. Do we store

Speaker 1  1:20:12
other fees or that's just from no cash we just incurred here. We need to cash it somewhere, right.

Matthias Miller  1:20:23
Gosh, what? Where? How the

Speaker 1  1:20:24
Other fee? RG for settings or not.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:28
Oh,

Matthias Miller  1:20:31
like, how much is a processing fee? Yeah, and do, do we allow them to override it? Say the processing fee? Well, it is $25 but we actually wanted to change it to I wanted to

Speaker 1  1:20:45
change it to be able to configure everything everywhere.

Matthias Miller  1:20:53
Well, I do wonder whether these other fees really need to be configurable,

Speaker 1  1:21:00
but maybe they do, what about damage waiver? Or is that very standard across the state? That's probably

Matthias Miller  1:21:07
standard you should not be able to. I mean, damage waiver is, it's the contract. You either get it or you don't, and we set the price

Unknown Speaker  1:21:13
right

Unknown Speaker  1:21:16
then. Do we actually need to cash the other fees?

Matthias Miller  1:21:21
Okay, by cash, do you mean copy them onto the contract record? Or by cash you mean, do we even need it?

Speaker 1  1:21:25
No, like we just need to go look it up from the contract definition.

Matthias Miller  1:21:31
Well, okay, but there's a commercial world in which they rewrite contracts right, different fee amounts, and in that case, you actually do want to cash it right

Unknown Speaker  1:21:44
this RG should, straight up, be copied across, yep.

Matthias Miller  1:21:50
But isn't there this question of whether you want people to be able to override these other fees, or allow admin to do it or,

Speaker 1  1:22:02
I mean, don't we let their Superman admin

Matthias Miller  1:22:09
do that? Probably, somehow, probably go into the RG and change the amount. Yeah, that's on you. We're at a row. That's on you.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:20
I think it's sane. Okay, how do we want?

Speaker 1  1:22:23
Where can we have all the contract definitions of cash in, like one place it's easy to get

Unknown Speaker  1:22:28
to? Yes,

Matthias Miller  1:22:30
there should be a good how do we do that? Where would you? Why would we just do details? Why would you, once you make details to basically be a look alike

Unknown Speaker  1:22:43
of the settings of the contract definition.

Matthias Miller  1:22:48
By the way, we're going to need more than 27 minutes to wrap this up, aren't we? Yeah, let me check. Can we move our video?

Unknown Speaker  1:22:59
We're nowhere close to done with

Matthias Miller  1:23:01
contracts duty this time to work on CRT Seth, anyway, let's bump to tomorrow.

Matthias Miller  1:23:27
Here to screw off just a couple admin stuff with Audra. I

Unknown Speaker  1:23:46
Okay, good.

Matthias Miller  1:23:53
We got we got until we're good to go until a meeting with Dwayne at like 12, sorry, 1115 Central. So we can

Speaker 1  1:24:07
crank for another hour and a half and a half. Let's go look at that. Let's go. Awesome. We're making good progress. I just yeah, I'm glad to have things starting to clean up. Yeah.

Speaker 1  1:24:32
I think we still have some confusion here between how we want to do it and how zfp did it. Like that's worthy. That's why we have like inputs, output that stuff.

Matthias Miller  1:24:47
So here's what I think, conceptually, let's just do number one, conceptual issue number one, create a clone of the contract definition. Just straight up, clone, same layout, same. Columns, same. Anything that needs to be cash should be as identical as possible, just with light name variations dropped it simple. Then

Unknown Speaker  1:25:10
what would go ahead?

Speaker 1  1:25:13
I mean, there's some variations, like the contract type is now a field instead of NRG.

Matthias Miller  1:25:20
Sure that's fine. I don't mind that, but let's create as much similarity as possible, right? I mean, sure, so maybe, maybe those are fields, but let's put them in a similar set. I mean, we can do section ordering, can still be the same, right?

Unknown Speaker  1:25:38
And then these

Matthias Miller  1:25:44
calculation values and divisors and all that stuff. Sure, that's great. I don't mind if that's in that same detailed section, but, I mean, I don't know. Do they go with the

Speaker 1  1:25:59
this comes across this, one of these rows, essentially, yep, one of those rows, these rows, yep, where's I wonder if we don't have that right now, we don't. How about, how about I pull up while we're talking about it. Anyway, how about I pull up the job I just wrote up. Look at that. It's in there. Look at that. What we're

Matthias Miller  1:26:27
getting smart now. It's like we're pros or something.

Unknown Speaker  1:26:34
Exactly

Unknown Speaker  1:26:37
so. Contract type

Unknown Speaker  1:26:47
R zero,

Unknown Speaker  1:26:49
type RG row,

Matthias Miller  1:26:54
contract Term or Term in month or G row, term, a

Unknown Speaker  1:27:05
down payment. R zero balloon,

Matthias Miller  1:27:14
I don't know. I think it could be a filtered list, because we have a max

Speaker 1  1:27:23
can a contract that comes from a contract definition that doesn't require balloon payments? Have a balloon payment?

Unknown Speaker  1:27:32
No, wait, that

Matthias Miller  1:27:41
was a weird question. I'm thinking my brains, I tell you now and like, what would that even be? Like? A balloon payment? By definition,

Speaker 1  1:27:52
that's a state, essentially a state. It is a statement, right? State requirement. I think we don't

Matthias Miller  1:28:00
know the down payment types. RG could be a filtered list only the ones that are relevant based the width of the product or the price, but there's still a hypothetical scenario in which you could have three of them that apply. And so that has to be an RG, doesn't there have

Unknown Speaker  1:28:19
has to be an RG,

Unknown Speaker  1:28:22
and then you select whichever one applies or what.

Matthias Miller  1:28:28
Well, I suppose you could, oh, as opposed to, let's go do an eval and find out what the minimum, what the minimum, actual payment, dollar and cent amount, is it only store that? Is that what you're thinking?

Speaker 1  1:28:47
I don't know what I'm thinking. I'm just not sure. I'm not sure what the cleanest way to field that across is.

Matthias Miller  1:28:58
Do we need to if you change the contract amount, but contract value? Do you need to recalculate, update calculations and pull stuff from the contract definition? Probably Okay. If that's the case, then you go, you know, down payment, type, number of payments, a down payment, percentage. Down payment, number, Max price.

Unknown Speaker  1:29:40
Why would there be multiple down payments?

Matthias Miller  1:29:45
You could require three down payments for anything. I'm not completely sure if I believe in this, like it's not multiple down payments, but it's like you need to pay three months as your down payment.

Speaker 2  1:29:59
You. Ah, okay, okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:30:05
that wasn't clear to me.

Unknown Speaker  1:30:13
Like you need to pay one down

Matthias Miller  1:30:21
payment up to 25k or 14 wide, you need to pay 30% cash price. I'm not convinced. I'm slightly confused. I really hope we okay. I think on the minimum down payment type. I think we can reduce it down to

Matthias Miller  1:30:57
I need I need clarity. This is confusing to me how it's set up. I don't even know how to know which applies and what error message to show. So this needs to be a design thing. And I think, for the sake of I think we might still need an RG, but it might not be the actual settings.

Unknown Speaker  1:31:21
Where do you want the note in the in here?

Matthias Miller  1:31:24
Sure

Speaker 1  1:31:28
you do. I do. When you finish these reviews out here, are you going to move the answers to the right places, or

Matthias Miller  1:31:37
what's the I mean, I should? I um, what it would probably almost

Speaker 1  1:31:47
or should you tell me when you gone through stuff, and I come back through and try to put it in the right place, and then I can delegate changes and stuff. I would prefer that if it's not too confusing, that's fine. I think as long as I know what the plan is, then, yeah, that's fine To do IDD finalize work through design for down requirements.

Speaker 3  1:32:20
Contract

Unknown Speaker  1:32:30
bias

Unknown Speaker  1:32:33
that's enough, you know what?

Unknown Speaker  1:32:38
Okay, um, so

Unknown Speaker  1:32:43
down payment fields wait and Matthias to get

Unknown Speaker  1:32:51
eased more figured out, yep.

Unknown Speaker  1:32:58
And then do we copy the late fee and other fear G's across.

Unknown Speaker  1:33:06
Well, the

Matthias Miller  1:33:08
late fee would be the RG row based on the payment terms, I suppose. But then do we really want to recalculate that when they switch? Or should we copy the late fee calculation across? All. Sorry, the late fee RG does not show the weekly versus monthly late fee right now. So do we want to copy the entire RG or just the

Speaker 1  1:33:35
do we allow you to? You can't have multiple rows for the same type or the same repayment cycle, can you

Matthias Miller  1:33:48
you shouldn't be allowed to Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:34:06
validate that

Speaker 1  1:34:09
there is Only one row per you came In cycle the origin.

Unknown Speaker  1:34:31
One row I'm

Unknown Speaker  1:34:46
a late fee.

Unknown Speaker  1:34:59
RG. Oh,

Unknown Speaker  1:35:05
why is there a min fee and a max fee?

Matthias Miller  1:35:13
Like, if there's increment per day per payment,

Unknown Speaker  1:35:15
applied a per payment dollars? Should it?

Matthias Miller  1:35:20
No, doesn't make sense to

Unknown Speaker  1:35:40
only be editable, and the method is

Unknown Speaker  1:35:48
only be visible

Unknown Speaker  1:35:50
if it's

Unknown Speaker  1:35:55
increment per day or per payment.

Unknown Speaker  1:36:04
Repayment, percent, aim for Max fee dollars.

Speaker 1  1:36:13
I think that I'm pretty sure that was spec. I think it's just one of the things that's not, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:36:45
um, so

Unknown Speaker  1:36:52
we're going to copy Across the late VRG row.

Speaker 1  1:37:00
At some point we should go, I don't know if this is Dwayne or who, but should go through the records, like a contract definition record, etc, and make sure we require or warn all the fields that are expected, like this record. I would think if you create a new contract definition we should be valid, giving at least a warning if you don't have, like, contract type rows or term rows,

Unknown Speaker  1:37:28
stuff like that.

Matthias Miller  1:37:31
Is that something that well put in the design the design section

Unknown Speaker  1:37:39
on just in here.

Matthias Miller  1:37:43
Okay, well, either, I mean, we're making the bigs,

Unknown Speaker  1:37:48
maybe in here.

Unknown Speaker  1:38:00
Make sure

Unknown Speaker  1:38:04
the expected fields are required.

Unknown Speaker  1:38:20
This in should this be in y'all's court, or is this in our court to tell it, to say what's

Matthias Miller  1:38:27
required? I mean, I don't. I think it should be in our court to go through, create a new record, and save and say, Okay, what's not

Unknown Speaker  1:38:37
Yeah,

Speaker 2  1:38:38
that sounds right. Not getting triggered. Sounds right. Okay, so

Unknown Speaker  1:38:55
we're going to copy across late CRG row, and then other fee. RG, Rose, it's just a whole other fees. RG, right, yeah.

Speaker 2  1:39:12
Why is NSF not we don't have an NSF fee type.

Unknown Speaker  1:39:21
Why not switch it to that? I like that better.

Matthias Miller  1:39:26
I mean two to design, but I don't know why we wouldn't. Let's just this is like a one of those things,

Speaker 1  1:39:35
and NSF, ba, fee type in the other specified in the other fees. RG, instead of its own field, it's been its own field for ages. I'm sure it doesn't need

Unknown Speaker  1:39:58
to be. I would love that. That would be the key. If we do.

Matthias Miller  1:40:01
I mean the even, even the adding fees then is like, Oh, you just add it as an FP, when you get it like, of course, somebody has to, for great.

Speaker 1  1:40:16
We need to copy this guy across. Cross

Unknown Speaker  1:40:35
ink, that's most of them.

Unknown Speaker  1:40:39
So you would should these?

Speaker 1  1:40:42
How would you feel them on the contract? That's still where I'm not. It's like we have contract, although contract definition fields, contract, customer, product, and then we have our RTO contract details

Matthias Miller  1:40:56
here, yeah, put in the details, child screen.

Speaker 1  1:41:00
In the child screen, okay, and can we get rid of the input, output thing?

Matthias Miller  1:41:07
I don't know. I have no idea, like I would think the output. In my mind,

Unknown Speaker  1:41:14
the output is

Matthias Miller  1:41:17
something that happens at the bottom below, like contract calculations or something like that. So you have the definition fields, then you have whatever the output section is that calculates how this stuff gets, whatever,

Speaker 1  1:41:28
like you'd put it down here, yeah. But I with stuff being in this child screen instead of because people aren't going to actually work in here, most likely.

Matthias Miller  1:41:44
You mean with the copy values from the contract

Speaker 1  1:41:47
definition, aren't we going to, I guess they might a bit, but aren't we? Isn't most this gonna happen in the entry process? Yeah, okay, I guess we don't know what, exactly what that looks like yet, so maybe they will be in here.

Unknown Speaker  1:42:10
So

Speaker 1  1:42:12
this currently we field some things like the RTO type, which is that's from here. We feel this on the main section, same for term length.

Matthias Miller  1:42:25
Do we just show those in

Speaker 1  1:42:26
two places? Would you move these? I mean, these are these make sense to show on the main screen. They also definitely shouldn't be. Why? No, you shouldn't be, shouldn't be editable on the main screen. No, there's a lot of things like that.

Matthias Miller  1:42:40
I think I agree it makes sense to show

Speaker 1  1:42:47
it can we have limited editing after the contract starts? Is that the right way to go?

Unknown Speaker  1:42:55
Most like

Unknown Speaker  1:43:02
contract?

Matthias Miller  1:43:06
I would even almost question that. If somebody says, Okay, well, it depends on what the reason is. If they say, Oh, 30s, I meant to put in something else. Well, it's fine, but

Speaker 1  1:43:19
what I was meaning was like, we allow the payments RG to get changed, resolution could be changed. Like, what's the best way to lock down most of the fields? Maybe it is limited editing. That's what I was wondering.

Matthias Miller  1:43:40
And then have an admin, super user,

Speaker 1  1:43:42
admin, that just overrides everything. And can I

Matthias Miller  1:43:48
like that?

Speaker 1  1:43:50
I think the override everything should be, know what it should be, but it shouldn't even Shouldn't it be something that the admin goes and temporarily adds to for themselves, or something temporary, like, I don't think you want anyone moving through the system and always having it even

Matthias Miller  1:44:14
maybe I'm wrong. What if you had a an X 30 button visible for super admins that say allow editing that sets a, you know, a lot field that makes it editable. And then that field gets changed to false on say, via field change expression. So they go in, they say, I want master controls. They go in and make changes. Save it goes away. They have to click the button again to get it

Unknown Speaker  1:44:44
back. You'd have to make sure it doesn't trigger

Unknown Speaker  1:44:46
on import.

Matthias Miller  1:44:49
You do that. Make sure what doesn't

Unknown Speaker  1:44:54
trigger on import. Do.

Matthias Miller  1:45:05
Are you poking holes in my glorious ideas?

Speaker 1  1:45:07
I mean, you could, what you could do is you have your field change just look up to see, was it checked last time? Right? Exactly. That's easy enough. That's easy enough,

Matthias Miller  1:45:22
so a lot to be turned on, but then turn it off.

Unknown Speaker  1:45:26
Yeah, so,

Speaker 1  1:45:28
but then, then, don't you and Dwayne, need to talk through what is actually editable and what's not.

Matthias Miller  1:45:35
So let's, let's in the design, design thing. Let's, let's create a proposal, or, like, let's do it. Let's just outline this proposal so figure out what should be edited post contract start, and then proposal have a button to temporarily allow full editing by Super Admin.

Unknown Speaker  1:46:01
Edit a button to visible for Super Admins.

Unknown Speaker  1:46:14
I wonder if we should add a Well anyway, I was wondering if we should add

Speaker 1  1:46:22
a macro for now. Well, yeah, that's the side point A button visible for Super Admins to allow editing.

Unknown Speaker  1:46:33
This turns.

Speaker 1  1:46:37
This would turn off after the first save, they could push the button again if they're desperate,

Unknown Speaker  1:46:48
if they need To, yep,

Matthias Miller  1:46:50
desperate, exactly.

Unknown Speaker  1:46:58
We do IDD, what fields are reasonable to be, to normally be editable

Speaker 1  1:47:09
after contracts start, yep, transfer contract, payments, RG, etc, well, and I

Matthias Miller  1:47:19
think some of that might be, if you have X 30s for forgiveness and fees, then the RG itself shouldn't really normally be editable interactively, right?

Speaker 1  1:47:31
So make sure there's an in import condition, yep. Maybe do you? How do we think through that's a permissions question. But I was thinking like the payments. RG, do we have a permission plus in import, probably. Or do we say, figure out how to create an import you can do whatever you want?

Matthias Miller  1:47:56
I think yes, I think so. And listen, there's only so much stupid that can be cured.

Unknown Speaker  1:48:03
It's very true. What

Unknown Speaker  1:48:06
was the thing about shooting off your toes? That was,

Speaker 1  1:48:14
oh, wasn't it? We're talking about you, if you can, like you can put a safety on a pistol, but if someone turns the safety off, has a bullet in there, points at their toe and pulls a trigger, there's nothing you can do about that. And then we were talking about, well, maybe the we were talking about refunds then, and we're saying someone actually shot their toes off and they need their last payment refund this they can go to the ER, I think that's how it went.

Matthias Miller  1:48:42
That's hilarious. Anyway, when you have a spare minute, watch the YouTube short that applies directly to you, shoot up your toes and join the world's largest minority group. Anyway,

Unknown Speaker  1:49:00
which reminds me, I should send you a short that Joel sent.

Unknown Speaker  1:49:10
Where was it?

Matthias Miller  1:49:13
Why you look that up? I need a quick break. You'll be right back.

Speaker 1  1:49:19
It's a video from Troy. Nice. Illustrating software release process.

Unknown Speaker  1:52:30
Okay, I'm back. That was appreciating that YouTube shirt.

Matthias Miller  1:52:38
It's great. It would no other person could have delivered that without getting canceled. I

Unknown Speaker  1:52:44
think that that with some reason,

Matthias Miller  1:52:51
with some reason as well.

Unknown Speaker  1:53:00
Oh, man, okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:53:03
all right, where did

Speaker 1  1:53:08
we were done with this, right? We're gonna, yeah, put the output just as a separate section down here. Essentially, yep, I think so. What should we call it?

Matthias Miller  1:53:21
Payment breakdown or payment calculations.

Unknown Speaker  1:53:40
And the first section

Unknown Speaker  1:53:45
fields cashed from the

Unknown Speaker  1:53:50
contract definition would be a contract details section

Unknown Speaker  1:53:57
that fair. Just call

Unknown Speaker  1:54:00
it contract details and then payment calculations,

Matthias Miller  1:54:05
yeah, yeah. Contract details are even like, yeah, or contract details colon and just replicate the sections from

Unknown Speaker  1:54:14
Oh,

Speaker 1  1:54:16
so you'd be anything like contract details rent to own contract type, yeah, contract details, rental and financials,

Unknown Speaker  1:54:24
or Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:54:27
contract details, late fees, contract details, other fees. Sure.

Unknown Speaker  1:54:43
As you need to think through rent to RTR,

Unknown Speaker  1:54:47
remember how much we have,

Unknown Speaker  1:54:48
right? That's beautiful. Probably shouldn't be visible.

Matthias Miller  1:55:01
Probably, probably not, unless there is dump. Yeah, right. No, no, that's hilarious.

Unknown Speaker  1:55:15
I'm trying to remember where we I would almost just fix that myself.

Unknown Speaker  1:55:27
This guy right now,

Unknown Speaker  1:55:31
it's right to oh,

Speaker 1  1:55:34
these guys, yeah, yeah. What if we do

Unknown Speaker  1:55:38
that? There we go. What?

Unknown Speaker  1:55:44
Oh, it's the button, not the wait

Unknown Speaker  1:55:51
a second, what am I missing?

Unknown Speaker  1:55:54
Oh, it's down here.

Speaker 1  1:55:59
Oh, it's because the field is the RG we're showing,

Speaker 1  1:56:13
perfect and the RG will be cleared if hidden. So it only would happen if you switch RT and RTR. But doesn't

Matthias Miller  1:56:26
hurt to bulletproof, got

Speaker 1  1:56:27
it probably would have never happened. But, well, not never, but basically, so this one we talked that one we talked about already. We have a note for you all calculating early payoff.

Speaker 1  1:56:55
We have some we do calculate EPO.

Matthias Miller  1:57:00
It's just not documented how it works.

Speaker 1  1:57:04
So should this be a two Seth document?

Matthias Miller  1:57:11
Why can't? Why can't Sean? Can Shawn look at the macro and and document how it gets calculated?

Unknown Speaker  1:57:25
Probably

Speaker 1  1:57:30
the guy just literally has so much to do. I'm not sure when he'll be able to get to it. He'll get to it like at some point I'm gonna actually have more ability.

Unknown Speaker  1:57:41
Well, that's

Matthias Miller  1:57:43
what. What is

Unknown Speaker  1:57:45
the this is not

Speaker 1  1:57:46
bad. This stuff is going to bump to three because it's, well, I

Matthias Miller  1:57:51
was talking to Ellis last week. Elaine Hostetler, y'all really going to be in pain. Oh, my lands, I

Speaker 1  1:57:59
don't know how we're gonna, like Jonathan and I are not touching c plus, plus, pretty much that's not just doing components.

Matthias Miller  1:58:10
As much as I love working with you. For your sake, I think you would just arrive and love i i

Speaker 1  1:58:19
love it. I just, I have not gotten anywhere close to touching it for a while. Well, not quite true, but pretty much. Yeah,

Speaker 2  1:58:26
so which it's, I mean, between RTO, at,

Speaker 1  1:58:32
if we're doing what we said, 20 hours a week, and then zfp, also 10 hours a week,

Matthias Miller  1:58:37
there's nothing changing a bit. No, I mean, if you're teaching,

Speaker 1  1:58:41
there's nothing else meetings and some reviews, there's literally nothing else to do. Yeah, I am over here trying to make some coffee so that i Nice.

Unknown Speaker  1:58:55
Oh, fun times.

Matthias Miller  1:58:59
Did I tell you I have a lead on a pole barn. Yeah, I don't know

Speaker 1  1:59:03
if you told me, but your older brother did.

Matthias Miller  1:59:06
My older brother. That could be another interesting,

Speaker 1  1:59:13
yeah, how would you how would that work? Is that like you do the design and manage it, and then hopefully, I

Unknown Speaker  1:59:24
just think it's too Yeah, anyway,

Speaker 1  1:59:29
what sort of skill would that be? Any idea is that like a potentially CFP at some point, or like a,

Matthias Miller  1:59:37
well, I don't see that's what I'm not sure about. They have a company here locally who does kits, which is like the backbone of every pole barn company. Like most pole barn companies, don't do squat. They just they go ask the kit company, what's it going to cost, and then they mark it up by like 20 to 30% and sell it. Yeah. And so

Unknown Speaker  2:00:05
what do you build? It's,

Speaker 2  2:00:08
is it like their stuff? Well, I mean, it's inventory on your kids.

Matthias Miller  2:00:18
That's, that's where there's a, well, here's the thing. I don't know what all it is, but there's software that they're paying $7,000 a month per salesperson for. And I don't there, I don't know what.

Unknown Speaker  2:00:30
Yeah, that's 84,000 a year per salesperson.

Matthias Miller  2:00:38
Yeah, but these are, these are, these are like, bottom, I mean, they're 50 to 250k projects.

Unknown Speaker  2:00:47
Wow. I think that's what Josh

Matthias Miller  2:00:54
the other Josh, I've got three Josh's in my life. It gets confusing. That would get confused. I'm sorry that is completely bogus. It's 7000 a year,

Unknown Speaker  2:01:03
okay,

Speaker 1  2:01:05
but still attend sales people. That's still a lot, but that's not quite as minor. It's

Matthias Miller  2:01:12
not that's not bad. I can't read anyway,

Unknown Speaker  2:01:22
all right, okay, so this is a

Speaker 1  2:01:32
here, here Seth is going to create a task, contracts. This would be contracts, first contracts.

Speaker 1  2:01:56
Research document how contract EPO

Speaker 3  2:02:01
is currently calculated. Here,

Unknown Speaker  2:02:07
I'll bet you, do we have a

Matthias Miller  2:02:13
where's the macro? Even if we had the macro

Speaker 1  2:02:18
contract, I don't know what it is. I haven't I think you or Jonathan,

Matthias Miller  2:02:24
I'll bet it's in the early

Unknown Speaker  2:02:26
payoff amount, contract. It's this guy,

Unknown Speaker  2:02:35
contract,

Matthias Miller  2:02:37
early payoff amount, internal. But we should check the only system.

Matthias Miller  2:02:52
So here, let's do this. Let's do chat GPT. Can you please write user readable documentation for how early payoff gets calculated based on this macro

Unknown Speaker  2:03:21
thinking

Speaker 1  2:03:38
most of this part is just display stuff. It is just display stuff.

Unknown Speaker  2:03:54
Can you?

Matthias Miller  2:03:58
Can you save for a minute? Yeah, I don't know if this is any good damn out. Oh, my God.

Unknown Speaker  2:04:17
Edit.

Matthias Miller  2:04:37
Okay, refresh. I mean, it's horribly formatted.

Matthias Miller  2:04:49
We could simplify each for the EPO section in second row. Oh,

Unknown Speaker  2:04:58
I see. No. I. Don't see EPO

Unknown Speaker  2:05:05
here. Let's

Matthias Miller  2:05:10
actually, I might have a better option you have in the project management plan or something right there.

Unknown Speaker  2:05:16
Oh, that second row.

Matthias Miller  2:05:20
Whoa, that's too in depth,

Unknown Speaker  2:05:25
very let's try this. Would you

Matthias Miller  2:05:32
like to put it in a branded PDF? No, I wouldn't really.

Unknown Speaker  2:05:39
That's so sweet,

Unknown Speaker  2:05:41
so sweet.

Matthias Miller  2:05:43
Let's create a second version.

Matthias Miller  2:05:51
Now refresh and do the v2

Matthias Miller  2:06:04
maybe we wouldn't have to

Matthias Miller  2:06:16
give a sack customer face, okay, can we take this version. Make it not be customer facing, but make it be objective about how the software.

Matthias Miller  2:06:35
Can we take this version, but make the customer be the rental company, not the renter.

Matthias Miller  2:06:51
There you go. That's better.

Unknown Speaker  2:07:19
Have closed his host. Settler did

Matthias Miller  2:07:22
well, they were like reviewing the contract line by line, but okay, but

Speaker 1  2:07:27
it's been a little while that they've been doing that. Right? It has been a little while.

Matthias Miller  2:07:34
Okay, so this could be cleaned up, but this probably is actually pretty close

Unknown Speaker  2:07:39
which one the

Unknown Speaker  2:07:40
v2 the v2

Speaker 1  2:07:51
and is this? Are we needing to add more settings, or is this?

Matthias Miller  2:07:57
This is the current EPO doc calculation as it stands now

Unknown Speaker  2:08:04
and then we can decide if this is what we want.

Matthias Miller  2:08:11
Yeah. I mean, this is, this is a correct method of EPO calculation. I'm not sure which one it is, but it is

Unknown Speaker  2:08:20
a, yeah, yep,

Unknown Speaker  2:08:24
okay. And then this guy, I'm going to just nuke, unless

Matthias Miller  2:08:27
you want to nuke it.

Unknown Speaker  2:08:39
This guy, I think I want to archive. This is

Unknown Speaker  2:08:42
old stuff. That's fine.

Unknown Speaker  2:08:53
Okay, the back here,

Matthias Miller  2:08:59
this the Calculate early payoff amount needs to can just disappear. Document how we are. Can disappear.

Unknown Speaker  2:09:10
Wait, this was also part of it, right?

Unknown Speaker  2:09:14
Yeah,

Speaker 1  2:09:30
a CRA conversion, something we were supposed to do at some point.

Unknown Speaker  2:09:46
An outcome, yeah, exactly.

Speaker 1  2:10:04
What, what is this stuff down here? Are these? All right? Of I

Matthias Miller  2:10:15
think this is contract,

Unknown Speaker  2:10:19
where does the charge?

Unknown Speaker  2:10:20
CRA conversion, stop

Matthias Miller  2:10:23
CRA conversion stops up a little bit right there. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  2:10:39
This one is still a to do

Matthias Miller  2:10:49
this to me, should be a building and contract closure to go up in Dwayne and I,

Unknown Speaker  2:10:55
which just like just from

Matthias Miller  2:10:57
the to do IDD all the way down to the table through the table, you

Matthias Miller  2:11:13
created a new section for this One. It's big enough. Oh yeah. Perfect contract. Contract closure.

Speaker 2  2:11:30
Okay, and then

Unknown Speaker  2:11:41
you handle the paper contract values.

Unknown Speaker  2:11:45
Yeah, so

Matthias Miller  2:11:56
the bottom line is that sales people do funky things, and they'll swap numbers on the like, they'll just write wrong payment for contract total amounts. And so if it's payments, well, but then, then, then, when you do contract entry, you got to reconcile like, what's what, how? What? How are you going to effectively calculate the the contract? So sometimes, if it's a lower payment, I think typically, what you do is you just extend the terms. So instead of 36 turn, you know, 36 months, you do 36.7 month terms or something. You I don't know what happens to the way, especially if the contract value is correct, if they mess up the contract value and the payment monthly there, you know the monthly payment amounts, it might end up being shorter terms, or you might reduce the monthly payments. Or like you

Matthias Miller  2:13:09
but the company, but you always should take the lower of all of that stuff,

Unknown Speaker  2:13:16
right? So I

Matthias Miller  2:13:19
don't know that. We need to figure it out for the state, for the sake of now, right?

Unknown Speaker  2:13:23
So, just be a section down here. Do you want to

Matthias Miller  2:13:31
open the design? No, let's do it in here. I think that's good in paper, contract values or something. This is why you don't do manual stuff like this, because it's

Unknown Speaker  2:14:02
the this stuff is this, can we just

Matthias Miller  2:14:07
throw this into a due date calculation thing? Yeah, because I feel like we're instinct here is still not right. I mean, I

Unknown Speaker  2:14:17
don't think it is.

Unknown Speaker  2:14:36
This is just permission.

Unknown Speaker  2:14:44
I've got a text

Unknown Speaker  2:14:53
those random things like this that need to happen.

Unknown Speaker  2:15:11
Are, I can do this later.

Speaker 1  2:15:22
RTO, RTR. This should happen in my object definition, caching job, yep,

Speaker 1  2:15:47
Okay, and this these sections are going to change some

Unknown Speaker  2:16:07
we still have term length records. We don't, do we?

Matthias Miller  2:16:10
No, we don't. Term links records are gone, which so then this is right. Do we even? Do we even care about this whole section here in my mind?

Speaker 1  2:16:24
Just ignore and we go code what, yeah like, and then update

Unknown Speaker  2:16:29
something like that.

Speaker 1  2:16:40
Am I being too? No, I think that's fine, all or nothing here. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  2:16:52
I want to do this. Yep,

Speaker 1  2:17:00
do come back through and rewrite, rework this back after

Unknown Speaker  2:17:17
that. Sound right? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  2:17:28
rental fees. See this, even this stuff is just sort of,

Matthias Miller  2:17:38
see that needs to be implemented. I think that's ready to

Speaker 2  2:17:40
implement. No, oh. Yes,

Speaker 1  2:17:54
I'm going to create a child job for that section that's easy enough to do contracts

Unknown Speaker  2:18:05
Add macros to

Unknown Speaker  2:18:10
fill out rental fees. Section,

Speaker 1  2:18:21
the design, is we are missing a bunch of macros. We should be displaying a bunch more macros in the rental fees section. Be the spec you I think it's

Speaker 1  2:18:48
going to be easier for us to get stuff done if I have it broken now into these little jobs and we just go and do it, and then it's done, instead of having a big job with 100 to do's languishing. Yeah, I like it. I like it. I agree, because I want to start making some hay, getting going again. Yeah, me too, yep. So, contract resolution, we have payments. This is just different fees and payments. We have an update fees on Save I assume that, is

Matthias Miller  2:19:27
that for like, late fees or something?

Unknown Speaker  2:19:30
I assume it's adding rows to here

Unknown Speaker  2:19:34
manually,

Unknown Speaker  2:19:36
may ask Jonathan, the update fees on Save checkbox, is that

Speaker 1  2:19:45
assistant? Okay, so if you add a row, like there should be a row middle of the day, you could check that safe.

Unknown Speaker  2:19:55
Is that the idea?

Unknown Speaker  2:19:58
Are we displaying it on the right? Her, maybe during the

Unknown Speaker  2:20:14
Okay.

Speaker 1  2:20:27
It's currently just there, because that's how we update the record with the import. We don't, we don't actually need

Matthias Miller  2:20:35
it to be visible, to be visible.

Speaker 1  2:20:37
I mean, it's kind of nice for testing, but I wonder if we should.

Matthias Miller  2:20:40
Well, we should be for testing that we should, we should change the RG to a child screen and put the checkbox in there. And if it does, it just add late fees.

Speaker 1  2:20:55
Think so, or no, not just late fees. It's like rental fees and stuff. Rental fees, sure, it's just adding rows to the RG, anything that or damage, like rental Damage Waiver, if you'd have a late fee, right, that sort of thing.

Matthias Miller  2:21:14
Okay, yeah. I mean, I like, I'd be a fan of doing something like that. Update.

Unknown Speaker  2:21:27
A contracts.

Unknown Speaker  2:21:32
Contracts section are

Speaker 1  2:21:38
you? Do you like that name for the section,

Unknown Speaker  2:21:41
oh, fees and payments off.

Unknown Speaker  2:21:47
Change

Speaker 1  2:21:48
View fees and payments. Should that just be fees and payment? Oh, wait, we have a fee and payment history.

Speaker 1  2:22:01
Because this is, surely, this is a very admin. Only thing,

Matthias Miller  2:22:04
it is a very admin. Only

Unknown Speaker  2:22:08
good child detail screen, admin only

Unknown Speaker  2:22:18
if you wonder if

Unknown Speaker  2:22:21
we're going to want to rename

Speaker 3  2:22:22
it. To

Unknown Speaker  2:22:35
rename it. I don't

Matthias Miller  2:22:39
know we could just add A admin only to the end i

Unknown Speaker  2:23:14
and then I

Unknown Speaker  2:23:23
or G

Unknown Speaker  2:23:27
update, Say, visible, I'm i

Unknown Speaker  2:24:04
A this is just

Unknown Speaker  2:24:19
use

Unknown Speaker  2:24:21
list fields and Energy. Guess sound right.

Unknown Speaker  2:24:35
Link to

Unknown Speaker  2:24:37
whiskey.

Unknown Speaker  2:24:43
I have to say, autofills customers. If you do, they take a payment. Do we show all contracts for the customer?

Speaker 2  2:24:52
No, yeah, that's easy to do.

Speaker 1  2:25:04
And and presumably we want to this, isn't we want the report to stay? Do

Matthias Miller  2:25:13
we? We have a user report that we were working on trying to remember where it was at in the process.

Matthias Miller  2:25:38
Me see if I can search. Ah, I did not mean to save. Actually saves.

Unknown Speaker  2:25:47
I don't think I have a whole lot

Matthias Miller  2:25:49
try saving. I It might not have done anything. Do anything, you're good, okay,

Unknown Speaker  2:25:58
I only had a little bit if I had anything,

Matthias Miller  2:26:00
okay, two day calculations, payment record, no, it was in signal

Unknown Speaker  2:26:06
Dwayne.

Matthias Miller  2:26:13
I sent it this guy. I

Matthias Miller  2:26:26
Okay, I'm tagging you in signal. This is the report that we need with some cleanup,

Matthias Miller  2:26:39
and it's all flagged as to do Kansas for what needs to be updated. Just run it on anything, everything. It's not required, but it should probably be. I

Unknown Speaker  2:27:19
There's I have too many tabs.

Unknown Speaker  2:27:24
Oh, that's the problem. I opened this 1b,

Speaker 1  2:27:40
and payment history, which presumably this just replace. We have something right now, I think what's it? I'm assuming we don't really want that the current one. It

Matthias Miller  2:27:53
replaces this report. Yes, standard event history. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  2:28:07
To replace standard event history

Unknown Speaker  2:28:14
with this

Speaker 1  2:28:23
with a standard contract fee and payment history.

Unknown Speaker  2:28:34
Base it

Unknown Speaker  2:28:35
off this user report,

Unknown Speaker  2:28:48
a word link,

Unknown Speaker  2:29:00
handle I need to do,

Unknown Speaker  2:29:04
answers, items, make the report Okay.

Speaker 1  2:29:22
Presumably, we should spec out that report, then too, or how much, yeah, we should,

Unknown Speaker  2:29:29
well, I mean,

Matthias Miller  2:29:30
again, this is where. But I think presumably we should, I

Speaker 1  2:29:49
like, after you save a payment, yeah, Jonathan's wondering if we want to be able. Able to change payment impact after in the first phase. So, like, if you make a payment and then you want to say, Oh, wait, I want to go pay some of this to the other contract instead of this one, we support that.

Matthias Miller  2:30:14
No for the first first period, period that can, as long as we can do that through the RG, somehow.

Speaker 1  2:30:21
So for the first phase, no, if we can just manually jigger it in the RG,

Unknown Speaker  2:30:25
right? I think, Yeah, I'm

Unknown Speaker  2:30:30
good with that

Speaker 3  2:30:39
report. We're

Unknown Speaker  2:30:43
just gonna here. This is

Unknown Speaker  2:30:56
right.

Unknown Speaker  2:30:59
Fill out the spec,

Unknown Speaker  2:31:02
to match, not the

Unknown Speaker  2:31:08
report spec.

Matthias Miller  2:31:13
So is it fair to say that whether that you guys will have more than enough work between now and Wednesday or Thursday,

Unknown Speaker  2:31:21
yeah, yeah, definitely.

Unknown Speaker  2:31:25
I mean I think, yeah,

Matthias Miller  2:31:27
oh, we should take a step back, just one quick step back, yes, or finish your thought, and then let me throw out mine. I

Matthias Miller  2:31:54
Where are we at on the demo stuff? The demo stuff is actually still waiting on me

Speaker 3  2:32:01
for, um, yeah.

Speaker 1  2:32:04
So configuring the field Sean is out yet today, so I'm not unless one of us does the mock up, we won't have that mock up to you until hopefully tomorrow, sometime for auto pay. Other than that, we're waiting on you to fill out the fields and then we can standardize the impact reports.

Matthias Miller  2:32:25
Who's going to do the let's see

Unknown Speaker  2:32:31
impact reports? Yeah, they're not. It's

Speaker 1  2:32:40
not it's not going to be that bad, is it? It's mainly just going to be replacing

Matthias Miller  2:32:45
accounts, precondite macros and then cross reference between, hopefully, between the fields. And what I thought I would do is probably go through and find a

Matthias Miller  2:33:03
I mean, maybe, why wouldn't I just, why wouldn't I just update the macros when I it's not going to take me that much. Let me just update the user macro, and then it's literally just standardizing. It's

Speaker 1  2:33:14
nothing, sure. Okay, so it's gonna say otherwise. I think it kind of impact will look a little big, like I want to I wonder if I should have taken but if you do that, then it should be super easy. Should be super easy, standardized macros and reporter, yeah, yeah. I mean, I'll do it nick or Sean, whoever we were trying to push pretty hard to get that out. No, yeah, Sean job, unless he's to load it down, yeah, but

Speaker 2  2:33:48
we wanted that, like, sorry, go ahead. Yeah, go ahead.

Speaker 1  2:33:52
You want to live by I mean, demos. What next Friday?

Matthias Miller  2:33:57
Next Friday and I'm out Monday through Thursday. Oh, you

Speaker 1  2:34:01
want to live this week ideally, ideally like live by Thursday fixes on Friday. Yeah, okay, I did not realize the community days, okay, yeah,

Matthias Miller  2:34:19
but it was so it was the auto pay mock up. Well, we need the auto pay market so we can sign off, so we can get the fielding in, which is what we need. And then we need the accounting impact fields in. There was there anything else that we needed for the

Speaker 1  2:34:32
for the demo? I don't think I mean, Dwayne had wondered about color stuff. We got that done. We got that done. Okay, which that was easy. So essentially, accounting impact is that's waiting on you, yeah, and then we just need to standardize, because the fields are in place, auto pay. I'm waiting on Sean to be back to do mock ups, and then we'll send them to you, and then we'll field it out, yep, so I'll have Sean focus. On that first thing tomorrow, probably get that done, set it off to you all, and then if you all can get it back to us by end of day, then we can

Unknown Speaker  2:35:06
work on it Wednesday.

Matthias Miller  2:35:10
Let me see if we could. I

Matthias Miller  2:35:53
Okay, I like it good. I just want to make sure we're on the same page. Yes. Okay, so let me go ahead and cancel Dwayne. I

Speaker 2  2:36:04
Good. All right, where to next?

Speaker 1  2:36:23
Coming back to this, we have a job written up. This is not a to do set. This is a To Do. Whoever codes that job, right?

Unknown Speaker  2:36:38
Well, I mean, that's

Matthias Miller  2:36:41
that Jonathan's court to document

Unknown Speaker  2:36:44
new Kansas. Sure, I don't care. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  2:36:56
so label the button as change

Unknown Speaker  2:36:59
make is, Oh, I get it,

Unknown Speaker  2:37:03
because we're making some minor coding changes visible for admins only. Should it just be? Admins? Should it be? Should this be to do permissions?

Matthias Miller  2:37:17
I would almost leave it as A to do permissions. I i

Unknown Speaker  2:37:56
Three, what if we did? What?

Matthias Miller  2:38:08
What's the ideal time for you to get sign off from us on the auto pay stuff? I agree is probably too late for you guys. Or does it or not?

Unknown Speaker  2:38:20
Um, I just if you guys don't get to

Matthias Miller  2:38:26
till Wednesday, it's fine, okay, so you're

Unknown Speaker  2:38:33
not going to be looking at them until Wednesday.

Matthias Miller  2:38:36
We'll look at them Tuesday, and you guys can cut them on Wednesday, okay? And we'll have another shot to look at them Thursday. But that

Speaker 1  2:38:43
sounds good because it's adding Fielding, and then it's also adding reporting, right?

Matthias Miller  2:38:49
No, I think he just wanted to be able to have fields to enter it. Oh, no, he did he want to? Did he want to report to preview?

Speaker 1  2:38:56
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So okay, work.

Matthias Miller  2:39:01
That is a lot more work. So let's do, I mean,

Speaker 2  2:39:05
I think, just tell me when, when you think you'll be done with the mock up.

Speaker 1  2:39:11
If I tell Sean that that's what he hits first thing in the morning, then I don't know. Was it two hours for a mock up? Maybe, sure, like like, it should have them to you by 10 or 11, unless he has fires to chase. But I, I think I'm gonna say that this is like priority. So I'm gonna do

Unknown Speaker  2:39:30
1230

Matthias Miller  2:39:33
Eastern Time auto pay mock ups review actually. Why wouldn't I do it? I'm gonna do it 12pm his time, because that's better for me,

Unknown Speaker  2:39:48
mock ups.

Matthias Miller  2:40:01
Gotta love the juggles.

Unknown Speaker  2:40:16
I said this. There

Speaker 1  2:40:25
this is not assigned to set label, update back list the RG fields in this spec.

Unknown Speaker  2:40:40
Okay,

Speaker 2  2:40:44
this one's here documentation.

Speaker 2  2:40:53
Are we ever I hate how skinny these are G's are, but hey,

Unknown Speaker  2:41:17
this is not just a memo anymore

Unknown Speaker  2:41:20
to do Nick update, shooting the message. Update notes back.

Unknown Speaker  2:41:42
Hey, okay,

Unknown Speaker  2:41:51
here's an s3 have an s3 section,

Unknown Speaker  2:41:58
right? Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1  2:42:03
It's not configured. But that's a whole other thing. Well, I mean, that's part of s3 setup, exactly. We need this

Unknown Speaker  2:42:20
contract.

Unknown Speaker  2:42:22
Wait, we can't do RGS, can we?

Unknown Speaker  2:42:25
Yeah, we can Okay,

Unknown Speaker  2:42:27
contract, attachments, contact, drivers, license, right? Those are the two I know of right now, right?

Unknown Speaker  2:42:54
Yeah, look at that.

Speaker 1  2:42:56
Look this records, like we can. I need to clean this up, which is kind of the core of it, to be fair, but

Speaker 1  2:43:07
All right, well, it's so much better.

Matthias Miller  2:43:10
How are you feeling? Do you want to take a quick break and hit products yet? Or June? It Okay,

Speaker 1  2:43:20
that's it right back. How fast to break like, like, 40 minutes. Okay, sounds good. So, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  2:47:00
Okay, I'm back.

Unknown Speaker  2:47:02
All right, man, this just makes me feel happy.

Speaker 1  2:47:06
Same. I feel much better about the project.

Matthias Miller  2:47:10
Yes, 100%

Speaker 1  2:47:13
okay, okay. And to be fair, we have stuff to work through here,

Matthias Miller  2:47:19
but it's organized. It's

Unknown Speaker  2:47:23
some of this is,

Unknown Speaker  2:47:25
well, do we need this stuff? This is just old,

Matthias Miller  2:47:35
like that. Can that can be archived, or whatever? Just uncheck the active if you want,

Speaker 1  2:47:40
yeah, I'm gonna just say this is old archiving. Yep.

Matthias Miller  2:47:52
We are going to okay. But seriously though, if we are legitimately going to have this live by December,

Unknown Speaker  2:48:09
I'm

Matthias Miller  2:48:11
we are going to have to take a major act like, could we defer contract entry as an example?

Speaker 1  2:48:19
Oh, I um, I'm not even close to thinking about contract entry this point. No, we're not. And I think you like also like, do we need deposits and checks and stuff like that

Matthias Miller  2:48:35
kind of well, that's a fair question, because why would you just do general ledger entries or All right, I'm going to send a message to Dwayne. Two things, two things. We are going to need more design time if we are going to hit our December target,

Matthias Miller  2:49:13
especially with me being out next week, I do that

Unknown Speaker  2:49:20
we need to stack up as much as we possibly can this week,

Unknown Speaker  2:49:25
which it's true. We've got a

Speaker 1  2:49:27
I mean, I think on our side, we have a fair bit stacked up. That amount. Was amazed how Wait, once you have two or three people working out, Whoa, it's like gone,

Matthias Miller  2:49:35
right? So

Matthias Miller  2:49:47
um, well, I am not unhappy about this position, but Strasbourg still going on site to Strasbourg, okay? And is that what's happening next? Week. That's what's happening next week, nice, and I'm pushing all kinds of changes through until then, nice, to maximize that. So I'm happy it's billable hours, which has been in low demand parts of this year. So I'm not complaining, but it's going to be a very interesting week,

Speaker 1  2:50:19
because you're on site there, and then you come back and have a busy Friday.

Matthias Miller  2:50:25
Busy Friday. I don't think it's actually that. Well, I don't know how much time it is. I think it's only 90 minutes.

Unknown Speaker  2:50:30
But

Matthias Miller  2:50:32
okay, you know how these things go. I don't Right, right? We get an interesting conversation. It goes for three hours.

Unknown Speaker  2:50:41
That'd be great. I mean, I hope that happens,

Unknown Speaker  2:50:44
yeah, all right,

Unknown Speaker  2:50:51
products,

Speaker 1  2:50:52
I think you were expressing fear, uncertainty and doubt about right?

Matthias Miller  2:50:58
Well, I don't know if it's as bad as, like,

Matthias Miller  2:51:07
some of this is design stuff, so like,

Unknown Speaker  2:51:11
resell and buy back

Unknown Speaker  2:51:14
is just non existent. Well, hey, this field's here,

Matthias Miller  2:51:21
drop list of product resell methods. Well, okay, but is this, can we do a to do Sean to mock this up? Yeah, because that's that's a cheap way to get feedback, cheaper than me trying to wrap my head, yeah, cheaper than us trying to wrap our heads around it, exactly.

Speaker 1  2:51:41
And Dwayne and I can section, Exactly, yep, and I'm going to make a task for that. That's think that'll help

Matthias Miller  2:51:49
help with this stuff. I like it,

Speaker 1  2:51:51
yeah, because it's terribly hard for me to stay on top of what needs to happen. If it's all scattered, to do's in the spec. But once we have a client scope, then I can much more easily see where we're at, what's remaining. Yeah, we I mean, honestly, it should have done this a long time ago, but we're learning,

Unknown Speaker  2:52:13
hey,

Matthias Miller  2:52:16
iterations, man. And I really feel like I'm very glad with, I'm very happy with what, what Melissa came up with on the development models. But I really feel like this is, like the enterprise development, you know, we're learning, if we do host settler, it's going to be, we're going to we're going to benefit, they're going to benefit from this. Yeah, yeah, for sure,

Unknown Speaker  2:52:37
this is a to the section is marked up in this spec.

Unknown Speaker  2:52:51
Is spec? Please,

Speaker 1  2:52:56
a proposal. Please create a markup I actually, let's just check and make sure it's not ready in the

Speaker 2  2:53:08
might be, it might be. It totally could be

Matthias Miller  2:53:19
okay. So this is a to do, to do IDD, to make sure that we like the mock up in the is there? That's hilarious. I

Unknown Speaker  2:53:29
feel so smart right now.

Unknown Speaker  2:53:39
Does the fielding? Right?

Unknown Speaker  2:53:42
Saying that, yep,

Matthias Miller  2:53:47
okay, depreciation, I don't want to think about, I'm happy with what we have elsewhere on that you are happy. I mean, we'll get to there. I think, I think we have that way. We have something somewhere that needs to be, yes, we do need to calculate the pre we need to handle the depreciation at some level, but

Unknown Speaker  2:54:08
lost where I was

Unknown Speaker  2:54:11
product.

Unknown Speaker  2:54:15
What in the world? Does this mean invoicing when we don't know.

Matthias Miller  2:54:24
Well, that's from August, which is two years in RTO times.

Unknown Speaker  2:54:34
Oh, why is this in dev spec? Yes, comes off the RTO company.

Unknown Speaker  2:54:49
It's not right now it should. So doesn't that mean we need to field

Speaker 1  2:54:59
depreciation on. RTO company, don't we? No, we don't. Right now, we talked about this last week or

Matthias Miller  2:55:14
Okay, I am just fair. I'm losing small threads of tenacity that I have. I so we dropped, can we throw all of the depreciation stuff, I mean, to a child in a big bucket that's basically slow, yeah, exactly, because it's, this is a huge it actually is a huge project. I'd say huge. I mean, it's a week. Maybe there should just be a

Unknown Speaker  2:55:42
child of product for now. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  2:55:44
child of product for now. And let's move all the discussion, all the conversation and everything, into there.

Speaker 1  2:55:53
And this is also depreciation, as is this one I don't care about. I don't think maybe we right.

Matthias Miller  2:56:06
Yeah, I don't think so. I

Unknown Speaker  2:56:33
Okay,

Matthias Miller  2:56:35
good, helpful, macros, oh, go ahead. No, I'm sorry. I'm jumping. Keep going.

Speaker 1  2:56:43
So overall, you don't want to just go through this. Like, I think the product record is actually very close to what SPECT I think so pretty sure, will we

Matthias Miller  2:56:52
potentially have multiple invoices for product? I mean, I don't know. I wouldn't What if you have a correction need to issue a correction invoice. I have no idea. Like, probably normally not, but

Speaker 1  2:57:06
what we did is auto push. Yeah, auto push if there's one. And, yep, I don't think we need to even say that. Like, no, I'll just say, if there are any voices, should we call it? View invoices, pluralize it if there's multiple

Unknown Speaker  2:57:25
I don't care.

Speaker 1  2:57:29
And I don't care either. Someone can complain in the future, and we can

Unknown Speaker  2:57:34
do it by back

Speaker 1  2:57:38
this one. Why is this a simple string field for now, right now?

Matthias Miller  2:57:48
I mean, wouldn't it be if they issue the invoice? I mean, I think this is a two to IDD like, will, will the manufacturer in invoice issue the invoice, and do we need to handle an invoice number based off of that. Wait a minute, cash collected a new invoice

Unknown Speaker  2:58:17
that wouldn't that's backwards.

Matthias Miller  2:58:25
Because in our system, we would create a bill and assign an invoice number on on the RTO company's behalf, or, I'm sorry, the manufacturer's behalf. This feels to me like one of those things that Dwayne really doesn't want to think about. And I wonder if there's any, it's probably barely fair. Just leave it to the IDD. I don't know what else to do. The question is, is this the manufacturer's i

Speaker 1  2:59:03
Yeah, did you IDD, is this section right? That fair sure you're doubting the invoice stuff, right?

Unknown Speaker  2:59:13
Yeah,

Matthias Miller  2:59:24
that, right? Yeah, it's fine. It's good enough. I just don't have a thought through and I don't care enough to, yeah,

Speaker 1  2:59:32
a lot of this is not completed. I think we have the invoice. That's about it,

Unknown Speaker  2:59:37
yep, well, I think I

Matthias Miller  2:59:47
Patrick RG, we have, we noted

Unknown Speaker  2:59:51
these macros. Are they? I

Unknown Speaker  2:59:53
don't think they exist. This guy could also be. Is it? Closed.

Unknown Speaker  3:00:18
Boom, I

Unknown Speaker  3:00:43
Yep,

Matthias Miller  3:00:47
and there we go. Is there anything below the depreciation on the live detail screen?

Speaker 2  3:00:54
Notes, notes, okay, well,

Matthias Miller  3:01:01
I'm very happy with the progress. Yeah, it's not, is it perfectly clean? No, is it way, way, way, way

Speaker 1  3:01:08
better, much better. And we have stuff broken off into chunks that we can actually work

Matthias Miller  3:01:13
on. Yeah, exactly. So, so big questions are so, so as long as we have the meat, we have, we have we have stuff in play to get the demo stuff done by the end of the week. The big remaining question is, Can Dwayne and I stack up enough work for you guys to stay busy all of next week so that we don't lose time on the development side? Yes, so Exactly, and and Jonathan's probably a fairly big question mark on that front as well, you're saying portal stuff. Portal stuff. Yeah, like he's been chomping at the he's got Go ahead.

Speaker 1  3:01:53
I'm also we have a lot of work to do to make non monthly calculations work correctly, which is probably

Matthias Miller  3:02:01
right, but that, but let's but again, scoping, do we actually need that before spring?

Speaker 1  3:02:06
Oh, that way. I mean,

Unknown Speaker  3:02:14
I'll add a section.

Speaker 3  3:02:20
None. Is

Unknown Speaker  3:02:26
it non monthly payments? That? Right?

Unknown Speaker  3:02:38
Yeah,

Speaker 1  3:02:46
okay, is this a good is it good to just have it in a section like this? That's fine. I'm happy

Unknown Speaker  3:02:53
with it. Okay?

Speaker 1  3:02:57
Because if we don't support it, we should hide list items, presumably,

Matthias Miller  3:03:01
yes, we should see. I mean, I here's what I feel. This is not getting very practical, but philosophically, I feel like we started in white knuckled and lean, and then we had a ton of ideas because of everything that's possible, yeah, and then we then we narrowed scope to demo. And then we said, okay, let's put everything back on the table, but we need to contract again and say, Nope, focus, yep, yep, yep, I think you're exactly right.

Unknown Speaker  3:03:29
Good. I'm gonna just write up a job for the student. Handle on monthly payments. I'm

Speaker 1  3:03:48
if we don't have this for phase one for December, we should hide the other payment option, right? Good. I think that's pretty key. Otherwise, it gets very confusing. Otherwise, it's a bug, right? But if we hide it, then it's just an upcoming feature. It's an upcoming feature,

Unknown Speaker  3:04:21
okay? Wookie. Okay, good. Well,

Unknown Speaker  3:04:27
should we call it a day for now,

Matthias Miller  3:04:30
I would call it a day. I would call this an extremely productive I would say so day. I gotta tell you one quick story so I am working on automation to I created SMS automation so I can create my own little work list dashboard within since I created automation with an SMS that feed stuff into a weekly task list so I can shoot reminders to myself. So it's asking Ella. I was like, this phone number needs a name. What should we call it? And she. Was like, You should call it Todd. I was like, Oh, that's great. The only problem is, I've got other Todds in my phone. So I was like, hey, what do you think? Should we give him a last name? Should we call him Miller? She's like, Yeah, sure. So I have a todd miller in my phone, who's my little assistant that puts stuff into incidents. And I could just say, you know, text, text Todd to remind me to do such and such, and it goes and puts it in, and then that wasn't personable enough, so I had chat GBT come up with 50 different Okay, I did it like I added to the list, like, quirky, funky, funny ways to say that he got it done. Put in the list randomly, sends back, sends one back, anyway. So you ever hear that's fantastic. Hear me talking to, talking to Todd. That's who Todd is. That's That's awesome. Oh, that's great. Sounds good? Thank you. Have a good one, yeah. Bye. Bye.
