How to play the middleman. When you're negotiating among

Unknown Speaker  00:09
several people,

Unknown Speaker  00:13
my sister

Unknown Speaker  00:13
recently shared a humorous story at work

Unknown Speaker  00:17
when

Unknown Speaker  00:18
she received conflicting

Speaker 1  00:23
advice from from two different people. And she, she ended up needing to play an issue. And she ended up meeting to go back and forth until she was able to resolve the situation.

Unknown Speaker  00:37
And

Unknown Speaker  00:39
even though it ended well, I

Speaker 1  00:42
realized how difficult it reminded me how difficult it is to negotiate

Unknown Speaker  00:45
between two different parties.

Unknown Speaker  00:55
You may have heard that

Unknown Speaker  00:59
the reason is, that is because each

Unknown Speaker  01:01
of the two different parties have have

Unknown Speaker  01:03
articulated expectations and assumptions

Unknown Speaker  01:05
of what they're looking for. They have

Speaker 1  01:06
certain things that they want to achieve, there's something certain things that they would want to have. And

Unknown Speaker  01:14
and

Speaker 1  01:15
many times those those don't don't align as, and so you end up going back and forth between the two parties. And, you know, the first person says, Oh, I need this and you take it to the second person, they say, Okay, well, yeah, that won't work. Because of this, as you go back to the first person. And you say, well, they said that you can't do this, because of and so you end up going back and forth.

Speaker 1  01:38
Now, here's here's the approach that many people take No, I was just scratch that don't say

Unknown Speaker  01:47
our first reaction

Speaker 1  01:47
sometimes is to try to persuade one party or the

Speaker 1  01:51
other. And so we use kind of a heavy handed sometimes we might use a heavy handed approach

Speaker 1  01:55
such as, such as relying on our

Speaker 1  02:02
on someone else's authority, or, or, or leveraging our own authority

Unknown Speaker  02:09
to, to get what we want.

Speaker 1  02:11
And and even though this may achieve results in the short term, it doesn't,

Speaker 1  02:15
it doesn't create healthy outcomes. In the long term.

Unknown Speaker  02:22
JOHN Maxwell once

Speaker 1  02:24
famously said that leadership is influence. And even though this is a fantastic way of looking at how leadership is not a position, I like to suggest to you, that influence actually isn't the highest value of a leader, that there's something that's, that's more important, more foundational, and if you if you use this tool, you'll be able to, when you do have opportunities to influence you'll be able to influence much more effectively. So what does that tool that tool is alignment, one of the most powerful things you can do as a leader is creating alignment within your organization.

Speaker 1  03:03
Let's jump back to this example that we looked at a little bit ago, when you're negotiating between two different parties and their needs, what you're actually looking for here know what what's what's actually most effective in this situation

Speaker 1  03:15
is not to influence one party or the other, but to identify what each party what he's pretty he's looking for, and what he's party the party needs, and then helping the party's themselves find alignment. So that in

Speaker 1  03:31
and helping them discover an outcome that aligns with

Speaker 1  03:34
each of the goals and what they're looking to accomplish. Now, sometimes this isn't possible, and

Speaker 1  03:42
we have granted this isn't always possible. But when you're able to do this, you're able to influence much more effectively, I want to take a look at a few other examples.

Unknown Speaker  03:51
Many times

Speaker 1  03:52
when I see young and marketers get into the one of the mistakes made mistakes I made as a young marketer was trying to persuade,

Unknown Speaker  04:00
persuade people

Speaker 1  04:02
and influence people. And this is actually it's not that this actually isn't a bad thing. And but but I missed the more foundational layer, that once I want, that when I aligned with people's

Unknown Speaker  04:16
virgin needs,

Speaker 1  04:19
with the future that they wanted to achieve, then I have the influence that I needed and demonstrated that I could help them get there, then I have the influence that I needed to, to persuade and motivate them. And that's the same way with the leader. When you understand when you deeply understand

Speaker 1  04:38
what your organization needs to move, what your business organization needs to move forward. When you deeply understand

Unknown Speaker  04:46
what what's your

Unknown Speaker  04:51
what's your employees need

Unknown Speaker  04:53
to do to move forward,

Speaker 1  04:55
you have the ability to create alignment among those situations, or among those people. Yeah, factors, I don't know, which is what you call it.

Speaker 1  05:08
Now, keep in mind, if you start looking at the issue of alignment, you might find certain individuals in your

Speaker 1  05:17
in your sphere of influence that are misaligned. I think it's important to remember that we are not we're not supposed to serve everybody, there are certain client service line that we should not be serving there, certain team members are certain people who are misaligned should not be serving on our team should not be helping us there are certain influencers that are not aligned with us and we shouldn't allow them to, to, we should we should be able to be aware of,

Speaker 1  05:51
well, no, sorry. There are certain influences or influencers who are deeply aligned, and we should intentionally pursue influencers who the line with our values

Unknown Speaker  06:04
when you're negotiating among multiple parties,

Speaker 1  06:17
start taking a look not only at how to influence people towards the outcome that you want, but start taking a look at how to create alignment between among the outcomes that that each each party is looking for, as you lead

Speaker 1  06:32
don't don't merely lead from a from a place of desiring influence lead from a place

Unknown Speaker  06:35
of

Unknown Speaker  06:36
of creating alignment, you'll find that the influence comes

Speaker 1  06:40
and you'll find that influence comes naturally as a byproduct.

Unknown Speaker  06:50
Take a few moments right now

Unknown Speaker  06:54
to consider your life

Unknown Speaker  06:59
whether it's your professional life or your personal life,

Unknown Speaker  07:07
what are places that

Unknown Speaker  07:10
take a few minutes to think about

Speaker 1  07:14
what places are out of alignment for yourself and what are people what people in your circle are out of alignment with you and and then let's take intentional action.

Speaker 1  07:26
What is it going to take to to create alignment in your life and either to create alignment with these people were to or to give these people opportunity to plug into a place where they are better aligned.
