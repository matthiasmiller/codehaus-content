Put some defining characteristics to your outcomes. In the last email, we talked about

Speaker 1  00:20
the process for defining clear outcomes, and how you can peel back the layers to go from a task to an outcome. It's like It's like taking a step back and looking at the

Unknown Speaker  00:30
at the forest instead of just the trees.

Unknown Speaker  00:32
This is how you enable your

Speaker 1  00:34
team members to take ownership of their respective roles.

Speaker 1  00:39
However, it's very important when when you do this, that you that you clearly

Speaker 1  00:46
defined these outcomes in the last thing that we talked about the example of a team member who's responsible for getting more leads. The problem is, how does your team member know when they are successful?

Unknown Speaker  00:58
You tell them to get more leads?

Speaker 1  01:02
How many more? Are they getting one more than less than last month? Are you looking to double it? Are you looking to triple triple it?

Unknown Speaker  01:11
What are the specific outcomes that you're looking for?

Speaker 1  01:16
if you're if you're delegating a task that can definitely be measured, you can set clear clear outcomes of

Unknown Speaker  01:25
have specific timelines

Unknown Speaker  01:27
that that you that you needed done

Unknown Speaker  01:29
by you can coordinate

Speaker 1  01:30
that that timeline with your team member to make sure that it's it's reasonable and it's and it's attainable

Unknown Speaker  01:45
look at the world around you

Unknown Speaker  01:49
is desperately lacking. clarity.

Unknown Speaker  01:55
One of the

Speaker 1  01:58
powerful traits of leaders is the ability to take

Unknown Speaker  02:03
something that's fuzzy

Speaker 1  02:04
and to define it and clear, articulate terms.

Unknown Speaker  02:13
Let's take a look at another example.

Speaker 1  02:24
Let's say that you're setting up a training program for new staff, you assign one of your experience team members to help to develop a training program for your staff.

Speaker 1  02:34
What's the clear outcome that you need to define obviously,

Speaker 1  02:41
is it just to develop a training program? No, that's actually the task, the outcome that you're looking for

Speaker 1  02:47
is a simple repeatable way that you can onboard new employees

Unknown Speaker  02:55
while

Unknown Speaker  02:57
so that

Speaker 1  02:59
so that new team members have a 90% or higher success rate.

Speaker 1  03:07
That's something that's clear. It's something that's measurable,

Speaker 1  03:15
you may have other requirements. The training needs to be accessible from the employees home

Speaker 1  03:22
or the or the training needs to be completed at the employees on pace, or maybe your requirement is that the training must be must be completed within one day,

Speaker 1  03:38
the more articulate you are as a leader in your expectations and the outcomes that you're looking for. The more you empower your team members for success. Pharisees kill organizations

Speaker 1  03:56
and they kill team morale because nobody knows whether they're winning. Get clear, be articulate, and go win.
