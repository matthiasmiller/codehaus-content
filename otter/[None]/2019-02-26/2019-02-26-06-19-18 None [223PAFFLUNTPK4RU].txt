delegation reactivity,

Speaker 1  00:05
you're working on a project and you got a looming deadline. And, you know, you desperately need work to get things done. But you feel like you just can't achieve achieve it, you know, you should hand some things off to yourself. But, you know, with a tech tight deadline, you're not sure if you're actually going to going to achieve your goals.

Speaker 1  00:26
This is this is a common enemy of delegation. It's easy to get stuck in the cycle of the day to day and and get caught in the in crisis mode and never actually

Unknown Speaker  00:40
delegate the things that we need to delegate.

Speaker 1  00:43
Ironically, this is a self repeating I mean, a self defeating cycle because you can't get out of your crisis mode unless you start delegating

Unknown Speaker  00:51
effectively.

Speaker 1  00:52
And you can't delegate effectively unless you get out of crisis mode.

Unknown Speaker  01:00
So which one do you do first?

Unknown Speaker  01:06
Now,

Speaker 1  01:07
how do you begin to unravel this catch 22.

Speaker 1  01:15
This takes deliberate effort. But I think it's critical that you

Speaker 1  01:18
focus on the things that are truly important, and allow some things that are

Unknown Speaker  01:26
urgent and unimportant. To fall by the wayside

Unknown Speaker  01:34
in all of

Speaker 1  01:34
life. And especially in business, we fight a constant battle against the tyranny of the urgent against doing things based on other people's expectations, and other people's demands, and other people's schedules.

Speaker 1  01:49
At the end of the day, you're the one who are responsible, who is responsible for your life, your business and your team's outcomes.

Speaker 1  01:59
It's only by becoming proactive that you're able to keep these deadlines at bay,

Speaker 1  02:07
they give yourself and your team the margin that you need to delegate effectively, and, and, and to get things done

Speaker 1  02:14
and to create a sustainable pace

Unknown Speaker  02:19
of growth.

Unknown Speaker  02:21
delegation hates reactivity,

Unknown Speaker  02:25
and it

Unknown Speaker  02:25
means that

Unknown Speaker  02:27
sorry, scratch that

Speaker 1  02:29
delegation hates impossible deadlines because impossible

Unknown Speaker  02:32
deadlines create reactivity.

Speaker 1  02:37
Choose today to focus on the things that are truly important.

Unknown Speaker  02:45
If you only have

Unknown Speaker  02:49
if you're if you're only getting

Speaker 1  02:52
if your day is full of demands. simply start by setting aside 30 minutes to work on the things that are truly most important.

Speaker 1  03:03
If you continue this habit on a daily basis and continue growing the amount of time you spent focusing on the things that

Speaker 1  03:09
are truly important. You will put an end to

Unknown Speaker  03:14
the reactivity.

Unknown Speaker  03:20
