How to Set effective outcomes.

Unknown Speaker  00:05
When you delegate

Speaker 1  00:08
in the last email, we looked at, at what it takes to

Speaker 1  00:13
in the last email, we looked at how to determine whether

Unknown Speaker  00:19
sorry, in the last email, we we learned

Speaker 1  00:22
how to identify when when we're micromanaging. And we discussed the difference between delegating tasks or delegating outcomes. The question, however, is how do you said Executive Outcomes,

Speaker 1  00:37
many times effective outcomes are peeled back in layers. And let me just start start with a simple example.

Unknown Speaker  00:46
When you've got to build a peg,

Unknown Speaker  00:48
you might call it

Speaker 1  00:50
one of your team members and ask them to take a check out to the mailbox. And that's

Unknown Speaker  00:57
and really

Speaker 1  00:59
one outcome that you want is that you want the check to be in the mail. However, you can peel back the layer and what you actually want, you actually want you actually want your vendor to receive payment let's and so you you you may,

Unknown Speaker  01:17
if you peel back that layer, you can

Unknown Speaker  01:19
tell your team member

Speaker 1  01:20
to make sure that your vendor gets paid and they get to choose the process whether they use bill pay or whether they cut a check or whatever mean means they use you can step back a bit and you can say that what you're actually looking for is you want to ensure that your vendors get paid

Unknown Speaker  01:37
on time

Speaker 1  01:39
and you avail yourself to to all possible early payment discounts

Unknown Speaker  01:50
and as you peel back the layers

Unknown Speaker  01:55
you can identify

Speaker 1  01:57
sorry hang on as you peel back the layers you start moving from a task driven perspective

Unknown Speaker  02:05
to a

Unknown Speaker  02:07
an outcome

Unknown Speaker  02:13
here's another example

Unknown Speaker  02:20
let's say that you hire a marketing

Unknown Speaker  02:26
let's say that you hire an in house

Speaker 1  02:27
marketer you tell them that one of the things that they need to do is they needed to

Speaker 1  02:32
to to put together some advertising for your local newspaper

Speaker 1  02:40
that's a task let's let's take a step back and look at exactly why do you want to advertise at the end of the day what you're looking to do is you're getting you're looking to get more customers in your door you're looking to get more people calling

Unknown Speaker  02:57
calling your office

Unknown Speaker  03:00
you're looking to increase leads

Speaker 1  03:08
the next assignment you give is telling your your team member that you that you are looking to increase leads and this gives them the opportunity to pursue different channels and find out which channel is most effective however, it doesn't stop there you can pull back the layer one more one more step is we all know that leads are not created

Unknown Speaker  03:25
equal

Unknown Speaker  03:26
some people are more likely to buy than others

Speaker 1  03:30
and so you can adjust the outcome again to say that you don't just want leads you want you want qualified qualified leads

Unknown Speaker  03:39
again this this outcome informs the

Speaker 1  03:45
informs the input informs your team member and

Speaker 1  03:51
informs their approach and which advertising channels that they choose.

Unknown Speaker  03:58
And of course if you really want to well

Unknown Speaker  04:01
everyone scratch that

Unknown Speaker  04:07
However, there's a

Speaker 1  04:13
peeling back the layers is an important piece of setting clear outcomes but it's not the only piece will look in the next email will look at another important piece of sitting clear outcomes.
