Alright so here's some ideas about the whole issue of inventory tracking so what are some of the topics we can cover I think one of the topics we can cover is are some tips for inventory tracking. Maybe that's part of it. What are some things that are required, I mean, one of them is skew assignments. I think one of them is simply being able to put together your pledge list, and this is something that is a you know your materials list for what's required here. I think it's something that's actually pretty simple and straightforward but a lot of people don't actually take the time to do it. And when you've done that. There's also this question of, I don't even know. Maybe the idea of all the different types of tracking is a good one. All right here's here's a concept. There's the pre empting the first step. Like, here's where we think that it should be and here's where it actually was. So this is going to fly to going beyond just inventory tracking. I feel like so much of the stuff I already talked about. So one of the things it does need fleshing out but what are the additional things like, what are the things that people don't talk about, you know FIFO or LIFO might be something that could be something this is informative for people.
