Unknown Speaker  02:07
Good morning Good morning go ahead and pause recording

Matthias Miller  02:55
actually we don't really need any migration doing

Speaker 1  03:02
probably no because we would only be we would only be thinking living spec stages right

Matthias Miller  03:18
we could change it the only thing living spec Yeah. Like we wouldn't

Unknown Speaker  03:24
yeah

Matthias Miller  03:30
thinking isn't set up No. Right. And then as far as the report though the report seems really weird to me right now

Unknown Speaker  03:50
I think adding some filters would be really helpful.

Matthias Miller  04:33
doesn't really make sense. Do we actually want to group it by solution provider first or do we want to group it by stage first?

Speaker 1  04:54
I could go either way. It kind of makes sense to go ask solution providers and services the copyright owner yeah I don't know that it's a strong

Matthias Miller  05:33
it seems weird to me that if code house has a design underway that it's at a different section than operationally it shouldn't be that different

Speaker 1  05:46
Sure yeah, we're the ones doing most of the design is even if it were after afternoon.

Speaker 1  07:20
Then would we stage plus stage plus draft slash final? When we include subgroupings for for the copyright buy or or are a would that be a column or something?

Matthias Miller  07:48
Would we do a column abbreviation is that too obscure off to the right like JM CCI

Speaker 1  07:59
we have to we'd have to determine a convention for

Matthias Miller  08:10
we have an invoice template that would almost work that I'm still using MQL T which should change for the invoice template I'm sorry the template code

Speaker 1  08:38
it'd be a new column would be we could just put the column at the column right in the between prepared for proposal name narrow column copyright by but your way you're in between there are right

Matthias Miller  09:09
that would be my one of those

Unknown Speaker  09:21
huh? Yeah. Put it in there and see what we'll assess. What do you say was the alright there all right all right I will go ahead and copy this over into a

Unknown Speaker  11:41
new change request actually get split into two separate chambers, too but for now just here here's a little bug, really minor bug but when we when we add manually put the client code in the title and then save the insert or then the client code down here it adds an extra space between a hyphen and the rest of the title I guess I should write out a neck hey yeah go ahead

Speaker 2  13:33
and read up a change request for it I wasn't super impressed with how I implemented the whole adding the code to the title so give me an opportunity to fix it at some point

Unknown Speaker  13:45
okay

Unknown Speaker  13:47
good all right. Oh, I guess we need this as well anything else from this duck Matthias for a new kid I don't think so. For I can do that please.

Matthias Miller  14:35
There is one of the roll into

Unknown Speaker  14:40
Okay

Unknown Speaker  14:44
go ahead.

Matthias Miller  15:33
All right that's actually there needs to save time just like that

Unknown Speaker  16:19
cool I'll plan to follow up on that and I guess we could try for a time for the last two minutes or whatever on that as well and was unplanned but nicely productive so all that started with me as benefited questions you're

Speaker 1  17:11
gonna want any other questions been hit at this point we can follow up more later

Unknown Speaker  17:23
no I don't think so.

Speaker 1  17:26
We scared you now know two minute questions turns into a half hour project

Unknown Speaker  17:36
what happens when you can make your investments All right a question here in the CTP job 7294 So check the notes on the customer the second report talking about

Speaker 1  18:11
the clients question about whether they can about editing the check in notes right on the report thought we had a link to a sample I guess the main question here is anything needed to finish out the design on this

Matthias Miller  18:54
want to just shoot me the link and maybe I can yep I wish the internet it would be earlier in the title and I could always see it just grab it

Unknown Speaker  19:13
you say oh in the browser that would be could we reformat it to match what's what's in this description?

Matthias Miller  19:29
I wouldn't want brackets but

Unknown Speaker  19:31
yeah they wouldn't want the brackets on

Matthias Miller  19:37
it. But it uses up too much space and hurts readability and you can't copy it out anyway.

Unknown Speaker  19:52
Yeah, get that link I send everyone

Matthias Miller  20:10
channel notifications don't always show up as descended from me I'm not sure why oh almost got it

Speaker 1  20:21
okay, you got it. Yeah. Ben and I were working on that figured it out and then tell me what to do here is not sure why this isn't in the incident already but I'll paste in a mock up from LS Do you have any edit notes please? Now go ahead

Matthias Miller  21:22
if you stop sharing I can share my screen

Matthias Miller  21:50
do we have next do we have pre import validation that can run on an import

Unknown Speaker  22:08
if we do I don't think I ever used to

Matthias Miller  22:13
be asked to give editable reports

Unknown Speaker  22:14
you're saying you're saying to validate the records updated one

Unknown Speaker  22:25
yeah record

Speaker 2  22:30
oh hello enable pre import validation there and advanced Yes. And then Ah,

Matthias Miller  22:41
okay. Check this out. Actually Is that fair then in the

Matthias Miller  26:12
what are these called?

Matthias Miller  26:53
Having to be select multiple

Unknown Speaker  27:01
like multiple boroughs yes

Unknown Speaker  27:20
you select multiple rows Can you can you edit I guess you can you can still edit the first one

Matthias Miller  27:31
we'll just grab the first one and edit it a little confusing but I think it's easier than any alternative

Matthias Miller  27:56
Do you have any opinions on this

Speaker 2  28:06
not immediately so the pre import validation would be if another user had changed the incident while this user was in the report Yeah.

Matthias Miller  28:37
Well is it within this report? Would it update based off of just update based off of latest values? And it's actually not if anybody else has changed the check in information while they've been in this report?

Matthias Miller  29:59
I think that's basically This example

Speaker 1  30:09
and then when you when you're underscoring there that's, that's just a reference to this record, right? Yeah, it

Matthias Miller  30:19
was a joy this morning.

Unknown Speaker  30:22
Okay

Matthias Miller  30:28
snarky comment about I'm not sure what what I would do if I would have to do all the work here

Speaker 1  30:39
at least thumb for other people was that would you mind giving a quick overview you had referenced MD an MD five and an X 30? Would you mind giving a quick overview of the MD five, or my se XClarity. I'm not sure if that's familiar with one either. So

Matthias Miller  31:16
I'm 30x 30 is just an import the MT five is a is a hash of information so that it always results in a certain number of letters. And is often used MD five is not as commonly used anymore for passwords, but it would have been used at some point for passwords. So here's how you do secure password. Authentication, when you say you have on your user profile, you have something, let's start with the very basic, the password as 1234. Password. And instead of storing the instead of storing the password, you do an MD five. And the only real way to figure out what the password is is by doing a bunch of brute force attacks in MB, finding all of them and seeing if they match. Well, problem with. So basically what the MT five does is it turns any any text into a I don't know what the percent likelihood is, but almost guarantee, you know, one out of

Matthias Miller  32:51
two to the point that right? Pretty to one in

Matthias Miller  33:12
4 billion will collide with each other. But it's a very low likelihood of collision. Now the problem with this is that there are dictionaries that you can download it says where people have pre calculated the MT five and you say here's this password, and here's the hash word. So what you do instead is you have a something called a salt, which is a user specific. Salt is something like ABCD. And every user has their own has their own salt. And so when you hash it, then you do the salt plus the password, which means that so anybody can see what the user salt is. Only the use of interests passwords, you take the salt, you add the password, you amplify it, you see if it matches what is stored on the on the user's profile record, which means that the attack table the dictionary tables used to reverse engineer MD fives basically becomes useless at that point. So that's what the MD That's what the Indy five is. So the advantage in this case, would be here we have incident. Here's the consent body. And if we wanted to somebody to uniquely identify instead of body well, we could compare the MD five before and after. And it's, it's very theoretically possible, possible that somebody would modify it and we wouldn't be able to tell. But that's a one in 4 million chance and rather than we needed to deal with it An arbitrary length of information we can only we can deal with only 60 characters. So MT five Richart refers to the specific algorithm that treats this hash. There's also a

Matthias Miller  35:15
Do we have a simple SHA hash?

Matthias Miller  35:27
There's also SHA hash, which is cryptographically. I mean, it's longer and considered cryptographically secure we're

Unknown Speaker  35:38
purposes encryption.

Matthias Miller  35:40
Anyway, that make any sense at all kind of gave you a rambling

Speaker 1  35:49
so so what is the I was wondering what's the conversion process from the text to the hash? Like, is it is it a universal the universal that like that anybody like what's the word basically, going to be only specific to this to the system or is there going to be that code of that hash always means the same thing.

Matthias Miller  36:25
Always this so it might vary between uppercase and lowercase depending on the implementation. In Mt five have a blank string is always empty five extra refers to so a hash is a generic kind of a generic term for coming up with some kind of unique identifier based on contents. And MD five is a specific algorithm specific method for doing that

Unknown Speaker  36:58
okay. So another way to yeah, alright, so

Matthias Miller  37:47
let me let me try to wrap this whole thing up in a very simple statement, MD five. And MD five is a type of hash, what is a hash? A hash is taking a large block of content and condensing it down into a shorter version. And MB five is one that has been used historically, for password protection. It's no longer recommended for that. But it's also used to verify integrity of files, extra files haven't been tampered with, etc, etc. There are other types of hashes, there's actually something called a CRC hash, which is designed it's not cryptographically secure, it's actually designed to detect mistakes in network transmission information, it's going across the network. The simple way to catch errors in transmission. So another example of a hash.

Unknown Speaker  38:57
Interesting. So it's a very simplified defector, or using a using algorithm.

Matthias Miller  39:09
This is This one's very, very simplified. It uses Well, as a very simplified way of actually getting into it. It's not that simple, but comparatively speaking. Another unique characteristic of hashes is that they're always one way. You can never go backwards in a hash to

Speaker 1  39:37
O. You can ever decode the hash to get the original test

Matthias Miller  39:44
without brute forcing it. You want it to be bi directional. Then you're moving into compression which basically says, way compression works is sample We're using the word the a lot. So, a compression technique finds all instances of the word die and replaces it with a symbol basically and then has a table that says this symbol means the word die. And so, so, you basically pass you basically the compressor on a visit a dictionary of this symbol means this phrase text whatever content data the decompression is just going through there and going through the through that compressed format and then copying creating a copy where instead of copying the symbol itself it copies what it represents that is not a hash

Unknown Speaker  40:46
got it cool, okay. Thank you for that explanation um then next next will be a VGA question here since 8259 and this had to do with stuff for parent job validations so yeah came up when when US was testing this job

Speaker 1  42:04
Ellison Nikkor proposing that we validated against linking to a job the ultimate parent of a hierarchy if it already has an hour's test you're gonna need to consider reconsider linking over to the parents job. So, I put a brief design summary there are a couple questions here on on how to handle some things. So, just want to check in with it if you have any feedback or feedback you would have one

Matthias Miller  42:39
so I mean, we need the money the validation needs to be implemented in two places needs to be implemented on the parent incident annual tech Be sure to answer

Matthias Miller  43:08
that before you say the challenge that you have to say hey go clear this first view so you can save us up operationally how do you want to handle it

Unknown Speaker  43:26
so then this would be.

Matthias Miller  44:00
The parent has estimated hours and you say something like the parents grandson has a committed hours.

Matthias Miller  44:45
Basically, the first thing we do the same and then here the parents incidence estimated average field to continue

Speaker 1  44:56
so, would that error be on Could it be here when we're selecting the incident or the parent or would that need to be on site it would be

Matthias Miller  45:13
Nick You don't know again how warnings and errors happen on changing son reports

Unknown Speaker  45:23
on what reports

Matthias Miller  45:27
validation errors on Jewish reports Do you know how those work

Unknown Speaker  45:34
no

Matthias Miller  45:41
for sure do a warning and error and save

Unknown Speaker  45:48
okay

Speaker 2  45:54
I mean if we really wanted to bullet proof it we could just exclude all I mean we don't want to but we could just exclude all incidents that have estimated hours on them but that would kind of defeat purpose

Unknown Speaker  46:06
yeah yeah,

Matthias Miller  46:12
it actually crossed my mind and silly anyway. Or lives easy okay, can we make this Yeah, I like it

Unknown Speaker  47:03
hey so does that so that's an answer to that question.

Speaker 1  47:16
My next question is do we need to add the validation for the finish date as well? It also says that the parent estimate the current incident was not have its own finish date do we need to duplicate all of his validation finished beats

Matthias Miller  47:34
Yeah or can we just make it the same validation if we would move it being lazy

Matthias Miller  47:50
thank you for the child incident you could you could have just check if either one specified and have the error message and indicate both sure if we're feeling particularly have a we can change that one of the parent consent to wanting on save and indicate both as well but I don't know if that are you better?

Unknown Speaker  49:00
Okay, well I'll just make a to do with myself here all right good. Then next. Quickly the follow up on EVs. Bye Matthias Did you all have a call with the client then this week?

Matthias Miller  50:07
Review with country kettle,

Unknown Speaker  50:08
not AVS. Sorry, country kettle. Yeah. Yeah, we did.

Matthias Miller  50:19
Pretty boring call. Okay. Basically all he said was Yep. My understanding. Yep. On the same page. And then he made a comment something about it being about what to expect is well organized. And you know, I may have some thoughts during that design, but pretty boring.

Unknown Speaker  50:46
Yeah.

Matthias Miller  50:49
The best time is the only time you want surprises. So I think I think this is good news.

Speaker 1  50:55
Yeah. Yeah, that's good. I was a little worried that there were gonna be a whole pile of angels coming out of the call. So that's happy news for me. So it's gonna

Matthias Miller  51:09
be a ton of work in depth, and there's a lot of yeah, a lot of stuff that needs new nailed down. But

Speaker 1  51:21
yeah. So I saw your emails needed to let him know, we would let them know by today. When he can expect the ballpark? I think, basically, it's we're just waiting for what was the email? We just waiting for 1000 members to basically review the email draft I think so if I remember, right. Like with the prices and stuff,

Matthias Miller  52:00
and you're going to send you the reduced bottom end of the range.

Unknown Speaker  52:08
That when we landed on the Well, I think that's what yeah, it was, yeah, it was 75 or 135.

Matthias Miller  52:18
I'm happy with that. But mine reducing it. I still think I'm right. But I don't mind being proven wrong either.

Unknown Speaker  52:30
I just resent that. So yeah, I think the main thing for me Matthias would be the in depth design price. I

Speaker 1  52:40
could try to work a little bit of magic Matthias magic to pull numbers out. Yeah, Miranda. Got to be at the upper end. Okay. This is I pulled it out about the middle. So we can we then bump that up to the upper end?

Matthias Miller  53:03
I just think there's, with the reports, the hand wavy stuff, we deal with reports that

Unknown Speaker  53:13
I mean, yeah.

Matthias Miller  53:18
But they argue with me, but I'm not sure what kind of argument you could pull that would actually persuade me otherwise. Sure. The only thing that persuade me otherwise is if you go through and you say, Oh, well, it's going to take this much for report and it's actually not going to be that bad, but I just don't think that's true. I don't think you can, I can say that

Speaker 1  53:44
so what we the what price I'd come out to for that in depth was 13 Five. And then if he accepts in the six weeks Ray would take it down to 10. So that was based on about the mid the mid range. So yeah, I'd bump it up and that would be 13% of the i n would be it would take us about seven teen six after the 3500 just to be 21k but full price.

Matthias Miller  54:41
Now okay, so here's the other way I might have him go out the rails.

Matthias Miller  55:00
I think you can get it done in five to seven calendar weeks

Matthias Miller  55:21
if you weren't doing project management eight to 10 if you are

Unknown Speaker  55:35
let's see feature 10 Yeah EVs us took about while they were still wrapping wrapping the pricing and details and stuff

Speaker 1  56:02
either taking about or took about 10 or 12 remember eight is tentative

Unknown Speaker  56:10
but I was out some so yeah xs would be again important to know we've got yeah

Unknown Speaker  56:30
we actually have a 13 day No Why is this not worked yeah anyway not quite sure what to say on that but it's not going to be probably not going to be less than EDS

Matthias Miller  57:12
now the I mean the advantage is that we don't have the don't have the external project but I do think what if we did with a bit of a psychological difference keeping it under 15k versus nothing beyond that in my estimation

Matthias Miller  58:21
we do sports and sidenote.

Matthias Miller  58:32
Looking at a 25 Almost 25% Discount move ahead in six weeks

Matthias Miller  58:47
where does the 14 five come out percentage wise with for lower bounds um let's see.

Unknown Speaker  59:03
So So 14 Five Little over 10% of a max brace I was 19% of the look for the min price

Speaker 1  59:54
actually this design target rate here 11% What do we do something like 14 814 Eight or the design brace and pre or post discount discount

Matthias Miller  1:00:22
here's the here's the big argument that shifted my perspective or revamp of the

Unknown Speaker  1:00:35
11 five

Matthias Miller  1:00:42
no 10 like 10 Six Seven

Matthias Miller  1:00:56
What are you saying oh wait on the discount discount we take it down to 11 511 14

Unknown Speaker  1:01:14
Hey I'm back please for the moment can you hear me yeah

Unknown Speaker  1:01:26
yep all right try again Do I just say something about a revamp of something and then cut out Oh

Matthias Miller  1:02:19
part of my fear uncertainty and doubt is again go ahead and

Unknown Speaker  1:02:43
enjoy join my phone here Okay Can everybody hear me now? Yeah okay I'm sorry about that not sure what my internet but hopefully this will finish things out

Speaker 1  1:04:12
because I guess I miss what you were saying about pricing and your approach to pricing and stuff but I think

Matthias Miller  1:04:49
it's similar in scope to EBS. It's still going to be a little bit low

Unknown Speaker  1:05:00
Oh yeah

Unknown Speaker  1:05:17
can you hear me again? Yeah

Matthias Miller  1:05:20
okay so So it's similar to EVs it's likely to be

Matthias Miller  1:05:38
don't know I just don't know what is the total per sentence were

Unknown Speaker  1:06:13
presented by

Matthias Miller  1:06:15
Bill percent of 2% design target

Speaker 1  1:06:36
so, I guess we could do 16 335 Take it down just had this nagging fear

Matthias Miller  1:07:04
that once again this is not a simple clear cut, cut and dried one and done

Matthias Miller  1:07:12
no cutting through Butter and Jelly Bean most comfortable with something like 16 three

Matthias Miller  1:07:43
which is still I mean that's sort of 15% or even 15% of the midpoint. If he if he accepts it could be 15% of the bottom

Matthias Miller  1:08:07
a little over 15% At the very bottom bottom end it'd be something like 62 or 63. And let's see is a compelling reason psychologically where we need to push it down below 15k. We can take a look at that, but I'm saying at that point we go from

Matthias Miller  1:08:40
Yeah, I don't think I don't think we'll take a

Unknown Speaker  1:08:46
it's yeah

Unknown Speaker  1:09:04
another option would be to try to reduce scope. If there are things that we could reasonably do, yeah, but delete or defer and kind of, we just have to hold our ground than any unit designed to not touch those about that building more something well,

Matthias Miller  1:09:31
okay, that would make me feel quite a bit different if we said if we said here's the price really in depth design, but we are not going to touch tablets, custom interfaces, phones, anything like that. This is just the system working for and that's actually probably what they

Matthias Miller  1:09:48
want I'm good with that. So basically like the

Unknown Speaker  1:10:00
He's down here at the bottom there are a few things that I've mentioned as possibles I'm tracking hardware enhancements and if we just say a

Matthias Miller  1:10:21
possible enhancements section and then put all those underneath it and just say this does not include that

Matthias Miller  1:10:36
and then if you if you do that then the original price was what again

Unknown Speaker  1:10:47
the

Unknown Speaker  1:10:50
13 five Yeah

Unknown Speaker  1:10:53
13 Five out of 10 Yeah

Matthias Miller  1:11:21
life doesn't mess with your percentages I would still do something like 14 for ticket down to 10 nine

Unknown Speaker  1:11:44
so in a half percent of what are we looking at here yeah 10 and a half percent of of the max

Matthias Miller  1:12:04
so, yeah 14

Speaker 1  1:12:05
Four looking at a 10 914 for up to a half percent of the max yeah a little low but

Matthias Miller  1:12:26
percent and a half a percent of the Mac

Unknown Speaker  1:12:31
right so then you're looking at and nine 8% of the max for your new Christ

Matthias Miller  1:12:54
I was doing some math 10 nine other bye

Unknown Speaker  1:13:10
don't know Yeah, but I'm way more

Matthias Miller  1:13:42
I'm happy with it as long as elephants happy with other members come out.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:47
Okay okay, I'll plan to reply all to that email then and go from there Okay. Sounds good. That takes us to the end of our time here. And we will plan to space then. Next week. Oh, good.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:40
Shit. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:42
Yep. Thank you, and any questions that anybody will do? The rest of the week. All right. Good.
