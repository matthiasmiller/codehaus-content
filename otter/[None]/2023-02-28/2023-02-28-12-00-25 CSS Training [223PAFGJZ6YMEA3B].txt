Unknown Speaker  00:15
Oh yes um one other thing scheduled schedule wise

Speaker 1  00:26
so not sure which of these I guess is these two mainly as far as looking at what is involved with the changes that we make for yeah the billing the billing details and reviewing the unbilled incidents and all of that yeah where maybe this is actually if you to

Speaker 2  00:57
drive and show screen let's do yeah probably

Unknown Speaker  01:46
oh nevermind

Unknown Speaker  01:54
playing around with permissions and so we'd be looking at ways that not editable people to contact us because it was it was wrong to do

Matthias Miller  02:28
and then let's also sort by incident title

Matthias Miller  02:37
channel where we didn't say in title but at least I agree with that a few

Unknown Speaker  03:01
minutes so

Unknown Speaker  03:29
and then let's also include

Unknown Speaker  03:47
let's see that's enough

Unknown Speaker  04:24
what's going on

Unknown Speaker  04:34
Yes

Unknown Speaker  05:13
It's not a sales it's not labs

Unknown Speaker  05:24
there is no parents

Matthias Miller  05:55
that was the unbilled neither discipline or the parent so this is actually not right

Unknown Speaker  06:13
Students?

Speaker 1  08:04
Now will this also take care of fetching missing rates that doesn't mean

Matthias Miller  08:11
we're gonna have to work on that thing on the missing rates what we want is

Unknown Speaker  08:26
what does the LOC stand for?

Unknown Speaker  08:29
Local it's a local macro

Unknown Speaker  08:32
okay as opposed to

Matthias Miller  08:37
the global one well I mean there would be cataloged define macros and user macros and then within user macros or local macros which are local to report in global which are accessible you can have the same macro accessible in multiple places

Unknown Speaker  08:51
okay

Unknown Speaker  09:13
hello

Unknown Speaker  09:42
I don't know that there's a good way to

Speaker 1  10:16
What's the reason that the mate that the rates don't automatically

Unknown Speaker  10:22
get applied in the first place

Unknown Speaker  10:30
because

Matthias Miller  10:41
and so you'd have a virtual RG because I mean you would need to have a virtual RG to show updates based on available time cards and then an underlying RG with any rate overrides and or stored rates hmm I mean just ease of implementation is basically it

Speaker 1  11:12
basically has to do with the overriding overriding

Matthias Miller  11:19
yeah but also you need to be able to handle when rates change so you want to store it on the incident at some level but you don't know whether you should store it until you track hours unless you preemptively store that makes that much sense

Matthias Miller  11:53
sorry I'm trying to pull up the I don't think we have a good way to do missing reads without

Matthias Miller  12:06
currently without just going in and fixing it

Unknown Speaker  12:09
okay

Unknown Speaker  12:20
we could add a right pane here

Unknown Speaker  12:32
that's something we could do easily enough with like an X 30

Matthias Miller  12:38
with the catalog change I think I'm trying to pull up in trouble

Matthias Miller  13:22
I might be the easiest way to do this for now and for some reason I don't know why I'm no idea why parallels is stuck

Matthias Miller  14:10
All right, well if you want to do the net wait for the load or something else, this point.

Speaker 1  14:22
Okay, so what you've got here though, is we've you're adding this detail screen report.

Matthias Miller  14:35
We've got the billable billable fields here. So I guess if you have the detail screen on the right, is that really necessary? Do you want that?

Unknown Speaker  14:46
Oh, that's interesting. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  14:51
Yes, it does make it I mean, it makes it I guess a little easier. I don't know. Copy and paste it down. It's probably fine.

Speaker 1  15:00
You'd better to have the incident detail on the bottom so that you don't cramp the left pane and have to scroll.

Speaker 2  15:09
We do that the other thing we could do is do something like this

Unknown Speaker  16:07
all right

Matthias Miller  16:51
I vote to do this and then remove these three columns. Oops, yeah, four columns. So you have a build a CCI button. Nice. We can just highlight and build the CCI and then anything else we can just drill in and fill out Harvard supposed to. Sure.

Unknown Speaker  17:25
Incidentally, detail down below is fully editable. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  17:33
I mean, the biggest glitches that you can't hit CTRL S to save you have to get saved. So yeah, that's really the only glitch with it. Okay, you like that?

Speaker 1  17:46
That's pretty handy. Dandy. Um, so is that going to be a standard report? Or is this a user report that will need

Unknown Speaker  17:53
to certainly it's just a report.

Speaker 1  17:56
Okay. All right. So should we put that in the in the financial heartbeat call? We're currently currently is. That's it's the same report you just edited. Okay, yeah. So maybe what we could do is, as part of that call, I just when I'm on it, I just open it up. While you guys were talking about other stuff, I can just open it up and take care of setting billing on most of this stuff.

Unknown Speaker  18:33
Yeah. I think it'd be reasonable.

Speaker 1  18:37
And then just to you in writing questions that have that point after that. Okay. So then that was taken care of this first one right.

Unknown Speaker  18:58
Centralizing billing

Speaker 1  19:02
bill to the missing rates, and I've been I need to take care of incident Setup Checklist that mentioned billing details. So am I right, that basically, you and I and Amber are the only ones seeing billing, the billing details at this point. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

Matthias Miller  19:32
That solves a whole host of issues. I mean, that makes it super simple as far as compensation as well. That's also respected. Right? Sure.

Speaker 1  19:44
Okay, excellent. So I'm gonna make a note here to follow up on this and

Unknown Speaker  20:11
So then I share my screen

Speaker 1  20:23
then the next one here improved handling of billable rates this one this was just in brainstorming that Austin I had been doing really good I've been doing remember as far as tracking historical rates and making it easier to track changes when rates

Matthias Miller  20:44
change remember something that should be fixed but I don't know that it's absolutely high priority to fix sure

Speaker 1  21:08
you want to throw any additional comments on here at this point or just disable it

Matthias Miller  21:16
I would just say for now we're using a separate report for Tim and Matthias to review incident billing

Unknown Speaker  21:41
right

Speaker 1  21:59
and then this in the sign off here on Austin but this was what we were just talking about

Matthias Miller  22:12
I think we I mean this makes us no longer be an issue right

Speaker 1  22:24
right i mean it's it's less of an issue than when we were still missing rates it's not being handled automatically but the mutation and whatnot we could

Matthias Miller  22:39
I have no idea what happened to my two parallels here

Matthias Miller  22:46
is being absolutely cantankerous actions and the suspending state I know it's been there for Reverend Can you

Matthias Miller  23:14
Yeah, I mean I can't I can't pulled up but I think one way to solve it would be a nightly externally that runs

Matthias Miller  23:34
and then just changing our other report to

Unknown Speaker  23:42
I don't know

Unknown Speaker  23:57
okay, that's that's fine.

Unknown Speaker  24:07
Good. Well

Unknown Speaker  24:17
Oh, well, we

Speaker 1  24:17
knocked out a number of things there. And, and see you again, in about half an hour. Okay, sounds good. Thanks. Yep. Thanks.
