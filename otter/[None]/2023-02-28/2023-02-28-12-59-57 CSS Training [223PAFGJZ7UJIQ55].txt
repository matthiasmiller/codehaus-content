Unknown Speaker  01:44
Again

Unknown Speaker  02:31
Never get back to your questions see that well

Unknown Speaker  02:53
hello hello

Unknown Speaker  03:11
all right so you that hosts screen sharing they go

Unknown Speaker  03:36
alright so

Speaker 1  03:47
anything anything to discuss on the end Hmm 10 year anniversary

Unknown Speaker  04:00
sent over another mug

Unknown Speaker  04:03
concept

Unknown Speaker  04:26
pretty sure

Speaker 1  04:27
you said that number of already needed requirement requirements get in the

Unknown Speaker  04:32
way Yeah,

Speaker 2  04:39
because there's very few websites where you can order

Speaker 3  04:44
fewer than a dozen and then yeah,

Speaker 2  04:51
doing it this way with both logos and the text in the middle once again you run into very few websites that allow that many imprints

Unknown Speaker  04:59
me Wow yeah

Speaker 2  05:04
some websites where I could do one logo on one side or both logo like one logo on one side the other logo on the

Speaker 3  05:09
other but yeah having those texts there

Speaker 2  05:18
and the biggest one is the the number of mugs in the order so far I think I only found two that allow you to order by the number

Unknown Speaker  05:35
okay

Speaker 1  05:39
Matthias does the JSON friendly city do something do stuff like this that would be more customizable

Unknown Speaker  05:52
hey I mean I know he does some engraving I'm

Unknown Speaker  05:54
not sure what it is

Unknown Speaker  06:09
I don't know that his are ceramic mugs as much as more like your travel mug tumbler types of things

Unknown Speaker  06:20
right I was doing a little bit

Speaker 2  06:22
of looking at friendly city great creative and yeah, it was all travel mode type stuff

Unknown Speaker  06:29
okay

Unknown Speaker  06:32
yeah

Unknown Speaker  06:44
I guess the other option would be spring

Unknown Speaker  06:49
you find her what I ended this or black handle

Unknown Speaker  06:51
they are now and

Speaker 2  06:58
yeah, see if they would have more resources to get us what we need or one

Speaker 3  07:13
well, the other way to look at it is can we change up what it's all about it's not very

Unknown Speaker  07:25
gets the message across was not really integrated. It's

Unknown Speaker  07:39
like if we would put

Speaker 1  07:41
the two logos on one side and the message on the other side or something like that

Unknown Speaker  07:48
take it from

Unknown Speaker  07:49
three separate items to

Unknown Speaker  07:54
two or whichever in mind.

Unknown Speaker  08:24
Statistics like 10 years

Unknown Speaker  08:32
14 users 56 Children 17 foster families 2986 deadlines

Unknown Speaker  08:47
33,923 edits

Unknown Speaker  08:49
4009 teen contact contacts

Unknown Speaker  09:03
put up put all of that on what you're saying.

Unknown Speaker  09:08
And then at the bottom copy keeps me going.

Unknown Speaker  09:24
Yeah, that would be a

Speaker 1  09:27
that would be another angle on it. That could be I mean, it would be easier to put text and stuff on like that and trying to get all this stuff.

Unknown Speaker  09:41
It's one more meaningful. It's easier to design.

Speaker 4  09:49
I mean, at the bottom, we could we could actually have one dedicated, one dedicated caseworker or something like that.

Unknown Speaker  09:55
We're not like that, but with no

Speaker 3  10:06
Why don't we could put but one software just kind of ranking mission sending orders the main thing would be getting Leslie and working with him to build some reports to get some of the stats up and give the office some time

Unknown Speaker  10:28
huh yeah cool

Speaker 1  10:38
yeah like I said you know I'm not super creative on stuff like this so I'm

Unknown Speaker  10:44
also happy to watch other people run with it that's been no I liked that idea

Speaker 2  10:53
Are you thinking what do we still put both logos on the other side then or is that the whole mug just

Unknown Speaker  10:59
all those stats

Unknown Speaker  11:14
should I play with multiple different looks

Unknown Speaker  11:17
see what everything

Speaker 3  11:37
I would do stats on one side and an inspirational quote about kids and the other side and I would just skipped the branding like okay, they they know it's us right and it's maybe I'm weird here and if anything maybe just

Unknown Speaker  12:02
the

Unknown Speaker  12:07
the CODEL shield or the posting try color no no why don't I like putting branding on the marks I don't know why

Unknown Speaker  12:34
got to be like the stats you know themselves I mean that is yeah

Unknown Speaker  12:49
yeah, I'll toyed around with that and see

Unknown Speaker  13:11
okay, cool.

Speaker 1  13:12
And then any of the other things there Matthias like, or actually, Ben What were you seeing as being an average price per mug for so if you're

Speaker 2  13:25
I don't think we're hitting more than $60 Total with shipping.

Speaker 3  13:29
Okay, if we're just doing three of them. The black ones are about eight or $9 apiece.

Speaker 2  13:39
The white ones were maybe even less than that

Speaker 3  13:49
it wasn't Yeah. Here's the other thing we could put on

Unknown Speaker  14:01
me see if I can find it

Unknown Speaker  14:07
sorry I missed what you said there first.

Unknown Speaker  14:23
Gonna get a higher res image of that but

Speaker 3  14:37
that's the system the original system design

Unknown Speaker  14:48
I don't know.

Unknown Speaker  14:48
I like I really do like the stats.

Speaker 1  15:06
Cool So then next steps would be I guess you've compiling the stats Matthias should I shoot you an email to remind you that or put something on your calendar

Unknown Speaker  15:20
let me

Unknown Speaker  15:34
just email him

Unknown Speaker  15:50
pool Can you can you send

Unknown Speaker  15:53
me over that list of steps that we went over them

Unknown Speaker  16:00
yeah let's see here

Speaker 1  16:27
good years deadlines children foster families

Unknown Speaker  16:37
placements are adoptions

Unknown Speaker  16:43
I have to see what they're

Unknown Speaker  17:01
users hours of training

Unknown Speaker  17:13
pets pets vehicles

Unknown Speaker  17:29
Yeah something like that okay

Unknown Speaker  17:55
sounds good

Speaker 1  17:55
I'll shoot that over an email thread there and they're

Unknown Speaker  18:14
cool then

Speaker 1  18:24
digging into some stuff from the Z GA and billable incidents like the hours report and stuff that we've been talking about.

Unknown Speaker  18:37
So incident

Speaker 1  18:42
7616 here so this came from from this bear incident there are a whole bunch of items that we had have identified here so like there was one bug there were some generic changes and TGA specific changes and as the CH specific change so I split those out into separate incidents and this one has to do with the whole reworking of the two pain report turning it into the belly for pain report so I'd like to go over that least briefly. Get your feedback on it Matthias. Overview is a top left pane is going to show employees and totals for the full hierarchy. Probably bottom left pane be used as the extra pane to pass values through top right pane is existing right pane choose information about individual incidents basically shows the hierarchy and the bottom right pane would show the the details basically the view timecard report or whatever it is that we believe

Unknown Speaker  20:00
Add entity. So,

Speaker 1  20:07
top left pane, current left pane currently just has employee that's a link back to the reopen the incident, we would take away the linking and remove the combined hours and combine dollar amount from the right pane over

Unknown Speaker  20:26
so on

Speaker 1  20:28
top right pane is the current rate pane. We'd have incident title this job hours in this job amount and this is showing that you don't have

Unknown Speaker  20:41
here so this is the

Speaker 1  20:46
current rate paints we'll be getting rid of, excuse me, the estimate this column the escalation estimate and the total estimated hours columns are CGA specific that are being handled separately we're getting rid of the two bit combined column

Unknown Speaker  21:00
and sticking with the other three

Speaker 1  21:13
we need to figure out what kind of sorting we need to just sorted by that

Unknown Speaker  21:19
hierarchy how do we

Speaker 1  21:25
get to that sorting isn't changing from what it is already

Speaker 3  21:32
sure what if you do hierarchy I think hierarchy probably makes sense. And you'll have jobs in there that will have hours on it and that's fine but you'd have to show them on hierarchy breaking even make sense

Unknown Speaker  21:50
yeah sure. And then the filters for that right pane

Unknown Speaker  22:03
How do the filters work

Unknown Speaker  22:11
incident in employee parent incident employee

Speaker 1  22:35
the bottom right pane is the what would be that incident of build a timecards Summary Report timecard details by for the bye week for the selected employee

Unknown Speaker  22:50
incidents with a link into the timecard okay

Unknown Speaker  23:08
like that?

Speaker 1  23:11
Yes, just Are we sure that we're only showing one employee in one incident at a time

Unknown Speaker  23:20
for GCH or somebody else fair.

Unknown Speaker  23:25
I guess I've been I've been thinking specifically

Unknown Speaker  23:29
CGA

Unknown Speaker  23:32
they'd be looking at it for their billing

Speaker 1  23:40
but no, they would have they would have the other building they would have the top left pane that where they can see the

Unknown Speaker  23:46
total amount. So that would probably be fine. Yeah, I mean, I think at some point.

Unknown Speaker  24:09
The conversation with

Speaker 4  24:09
Arlen Roth last night about mythology and dragons, and the definition of a dragon is something that is has the wrong form. It's not sighs it's the wrong form for its

Speaker 3  24:26
purpose basically. misshapen effectively, okay. And another principle of Greek mythology was singularity of purpose. So, I think there's

Speaker 4  24:52
limited utility infinite ways to slice and dice in purchasing

Speaker 4  25:03
conceivable variations are have a role to all employees or allow you to select multiple employees simple to to allow you to select multiple boys it's fine

Unknown Speaker  25:19
but some point feels like we're introducing complexity

Unknown Speaker  25:28
for information that is still accessible enough

Unknown Speaker  25:37
then I don't want to create dragons yep

Speaker 1  25:46
you don't want to start a new at a new point to the courthouse was a mission statement I wish we build customizable software and systems and dragons for businesses

Speaker 4  26:02
would much rather be the one known for slaying dragons and reading them

Unknown Speaker  26:17
all right,

Speaker 1  26:18
bottom right pane filters will I guess again be

Unknown Speaker  26:25
a parent incident and employee

Unknown Speaker  26:38
Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  26:39
well it's not parent incident. It's just incident

Unknown Speaker  26:42
incident. Okay. Sure.

Speaker 1  26:50
Cool, and then the figurehead so yeah,

Speaker 4  26:55
I mean I was gonna dress the to do mmm seems to me I'm not against proposing I used to be the one specking it out I don't know the details of what's required they're gonna just let him

Unknown Speaker  27:04
okay

Unknown Speaker  27:43
Okay, sounds good

Unknown Speaker  28:02
let us see what they have to say about that

Unknown Speaker  28:06
and then the next one

Speaker 1  28:16
has to do with is this one is 7614

Unknown Speaker  28:24
Well actually, I don't think we need to talk about this one.

Speaker 1  28:28
It's dependent on the one we're just looking at, it's just adding the Z GA specific items there. So, actually nevermind on that one. I

Unknown Speaker  28:40
need a follow up on that.

Speaker 1  28:44
So then the other one that we actually need to work on is 7650. And this one has to do with removing that link

Unknown Speaker  29:03
and

Speaker 1  29:16
so basically here we're just removing the view timecards link from the billing details sec. billing details child screen. Do we also do away with their corresponding report for that? That opens where do we keep that or is that report already gone?

Speaker 1  29:48
No, it's still the report is there? That's no so we ignore hours cost and notes

Unknown Speaker  30:06
Do we just use this

Unknown Speaker  30:07
as the

Unknown Speaker  30:11
as that bottom right pane

Unknown Speaker  30:22
sorry was that we are detailed records yeah can you jump into it that's what this one right here is

Speaker 4  30:38
this report and I think something like this would be appropriate to

Speaker 3  30:41
use in that bottom right pane

Speaker 1  30:50
okay excuse me so that would be this one is showing multiple employees for the single incident

Unknown Speaker  31:04
a and

Unknown Speaker  31:05
ask proper employee okay so okay

Unknown Speaker  31:25
let's see here

Unknown Speaker  31:49
leave

Unknown Speaker  32:04
okay

Unknown Speaker  32:07
one that and

Unknown Speaker  32:46
Okay

Unknown Speaker  32:52
sounds good

Speaker 1  33:04
next question here I guess go under see here is GTK in depth design

Unknown Speaker  33:17
is

Unknown Speaker  33:18
5729

Unknown Speaker  33:26
So,

Speaker 1  33:27
think Inc looking at getting started on on indepth design phases three and four here soon

Speaker 1  33:41
so, we were done with the design for phases one and two. And I was Where did I put my notes now?

Speaker 3  34:07
Oh, maybe I was having him in various places. Yeah, so basically I'm

Speaker 1  34:14
wondering, do we go ahead and start cleaning up phases one and two in a proposal and turning them into a living spec. So instead of saying phase one, phase two, just combine it all together into into one

Unknown Speaker  34:28
coherent spec.

Speaker 1  34:32
As we go along, once it's deployed, then say okay, we're gonna go back in and pull it all together. And then likewise, once we get to phases three and four, deploy those, then we go back and incorporate those fully into it into the main proposal, living spec, or do we keep stuff broken out as phase one, phase two, phase three, phase four.

Unknown Speaker  34:55
The only reason I

Speaker 4  34:59
only possible advantage Wait is that it makes it easier to mean maybe it's a little easier when we're doing it all at the same time. The downside of waiting is that when

Speaker 4  35:19
if you need a change request for phase one and two, it just makes it that much more complicated to find

Unknown Speaker  35:23
out where it belongs. And so I mean, I think it's

Speaker 4  35:32
relatively inconsequential I think it probably makes sense to do

Unknown Speaker  35:36
it in smart just to do those three deploy

Unknown Speaker  35:48
Okay

Speaker 1  35:54
sounds good. And time for time tracked for updating living specs. Like we wouldn't redo a change request that's tracked one usually tracks on the testing job. But probably for something like this that we attract time on the client support

Unknown Speaker  36:14
incident

Unknown Speaker  36:17
just go back to CCI. Does that sound right

Unknown Speaker  36:24
yeah, well the deployment incident Sure, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  36:31
That makes sense to

Unknown Speaker  36:37
probably ultimately a question of how Alice wants to know but I think it's I think it's a factor of deployment

Unknown Speaker  36:48
Exactly. Well, yeah that's my that would be my off the cuff Yeah

Unknown Speaker  37:10
Okay,

Unknown Speaker  37:11
sounds good. Well, I will probably work on stuff and

Unknown Speaker  37:18
some point here as well

Unknown Speaker  37:24
no here

Unknown Speaker  37:43
okay

Speaker 1  37:48
then I think switching back to just a regular says wiki probably not we can switch it here to 3633 this might not take real long but just wanted to touch base on this incident again. This is one that we had gone over. We've gone over some things on our call with Ellis a while back. And we had we had talked about having clients or using the support at addresses

Unknown Speaker  38:19
and then

Speaker 1  38:24
then fielding the incoming change requests. And then it also talks about setting up the phone menu

Unknown Speaker  38:33
and talked about

Speaker 1  38:36
having living specs live in the client system in early 2023. So just wanted to circle around on those things and I mean we found menu and living specs let's see what your thoughts are on that at this point Matthias how hard to keep pursuing one or both of those here in the first part of 23.

Unknown Speaker  39:24
So I mean on the menu bar, we would have changes

Speaker 4  39:27
change one for sales to support and they call extensions start with Wait, we don't have control over extension numbers. Do we it's

Unknown Speaker  39:38
yeah, I'm not.

Speaker 1  39:39
I'm not sure we were talking. It was sounding like we maybe didn't have much. three digit extensions versus one

Unknown Speaker  40:15
and this isn't high priority

Unknown Speaker  40:16
I don't think we need to

Unknown Speaker  40:20
especially into a to heart I

Unknown Speaker  40:24
mean part of my question is this is this tool

Unknown Speaker  40:27
priority I have a really hard time hearing about it but maybe I should the phone side

Unknown Speaker  40:51
yeah

Unknown Speaker  40:57
I think I'm fine with just tabling that for now we really

Speaker 1  41:06
we don't get a lot of leads in via phone and we get even fewer support requests in via phone

Unknown Speaker  41:13
and most people have fans direct lines

Speaker 1  41:28
right I think part of what we're trying to do is get to train people away from reaching out directly with the phone as well. But that happens less than email so I think

Unknown Speaker  41:42
it can also happen it can happen later on Yeah, I mean it's not complicated to set up call routing Yeah, but

Speaker 4  42:02
yeah. Living stinking living specs which means meanwhile recall there was some kind of coding or something that was needed to be done for that

Unknown Speaker  42:12
or yeah, I'm not sure what was

Speaker 1  42:21
I guess I could send an email and pick up that conversation again

Unknown Speaker  42:27
take a look at core posle

Unknown Speaker  42:47
it's waiting on this

Unknown Speaker  43:08
so I guess I can

Unknown Speaker  43:10
pump it to LLC again his approval

Speaker 4  43:15
I mean we're charging maintenance we said we're gonna do living specs and it seems like next year

Unknown Speaker  43:39
okay

Unknown Speaker  43:48
so let me make a note here

Speaker 1  44:15
Okay, well I'll find a follow up with ls than one on those proposal things seek things and we will also need good documentation on

Unknown Speaker  44:31
on the process

Unknown Speaker  44:35
documentation procedures

Unknown Speaker  44:52
Okay,

Speaker 1  44:53
well then I will append to follow up on that and

Speaker 3  44:58
I'm there Who is responsible for setting up new clients systems in the billing system and elsewhere plan scope

Unknown Speaker  45:18
see

Speaker 1  45:22
we have this as deployment set up live

Unknown Speaker  45:26
system so it looks like

Unknown Speaker  45:49
it would be

Unknown Speaker  45:57
documentation thing that I need to work on updating

Unknown Speaker  46:01
clarifying

Unknown Speaker  46:18
Oh as clients go I think I

Speaker 1  46:25
think Heidi was doing setting up the subscriptions and maybe Austin says the most recent one so I think one of us was taking care of doing what we could and then I think you were doing the the other like the more technical stuff or whatever I

Unknown Speaker  46:47
was on board with that

Unknown Speaker  46:53
there's something that you would like to

Unknown Speaker  46:57
update or change

Unknown Speaker  47:39
let me do this yeah

Unknown Speaker  48:25
yeah I wonder if if somebody I don't know who should set up a fuse an inactive few subscription on those instructions

Unknown Speaker  49:03
Oh, it's used zango in with a

Unknown Speaker  49:08
standard package is it Yeah. Cool.

Unknown Speaker  49:14
There's a little bit of a gamble and offered in a payment plan and

Unknown Speaker  49:19
see how it goes

Unknown Speaker  49:27
okay

Speaker 1  49:32
so when is that? What's the plan for that? Like when would they be going live and

Unknown Speaker  49:39
we're working to get involved so you can start using it we got a call scheduled for the day.

Unknown Speaker  49:43
So as soon as it's available okay

Speaker 1  49:52
let's see. I can get you I can try to get so no really think that checklists and stuff for

Unknown Speaker  50:01
Getting stuff set up even on the

Unknown Speaker  50:05
support side of things and documentation and whatnot, or

Unknown Speaker  50:13
training and whatnot.

Speaker 1  50:16
What we've done for themes Inc, when they set up the standard one Yep. Is that a is that a code house or I guess it'd be code house

Unknown Speaker  50:29
client. Yeah

Unknown Speaker  50:37
cool

Speaker 1  50:48
okay, well I think with that I would say let's go ahead and call it a wrap. I've got to wrap up follow up work here to do and so unless either you guys has anything at this point

Unknown Speaker  51:05
I do have something

Speaker 2  51:09
Justin emailed back right before this call started. So I figured I just got on here instead of switching around with emails. He said that the week of the 13th He only has Monday and maybe Friday open to do high level design calls.

Unknown Speaker  51:29
And so he was

Speaker 2  51:30
wondering about next week which obviously next week doesn't work for me to join. So should we either try to get the two of you to do calls next week? Or do we bump it out to the following week?

Unknown Speaker  51:44
Should be the What is that like? That's one yes. One Yes. Um, I think we bump it out a week to Tony. Yeah, I think so

Speaker 1  52:01
too. Was there something else that we were putting on the calendar for the 20th maybe not I'm not seeing anything on the calendar so hopefully I didn't

Unknown Speaker  52:13
know just double check

Unknown Speaker  52:27
search my

Unknown Speaker  52:28
email see what I committed promise to people?

Unknown Speaker  52:53
Yeah, no, I

Unknown Speaker  52:59
think it's fine. Okay. Just shoot the same.

Unknown Speaker  53:07
Monday, Tuesday. Thursday, one to 230. Eastern.

Unknown Speaker  53:13
Monday, Tuesday Yeah. Monday make sure it's good. Maybe Tuesday Thursday is what I'm only I'm only joining for Monday and Tuesday is that right

Unknown Speaker  53:45
we decided with that

Speaker 3  53:59
don't remember? Yeah. Certainly Monday and Tuesday. Yeah, we have initially

Speaker 4  54:10
as long as they only need to be there Monday and Tuesday. That was great. I can't I can't be there Thursday.

Unknown Speaker  54:15
That sense.

Unknown Speaker  54:19
As long as I'm available the following week, so whatever

Unknown Speaker  54:21
forward times we had

Speaker 2  54:24
that was going to be the following Monday in the morning. And then the following Tuesday, Tim and I were going to do a call in the morning and then all three of us were going to do a call with him in the afternoon.

Unknown Speaker  54:38
Okay, that's good.

Speaker 1  54:43
Cool. Good general idea was that we were going to this first calls are going to be more like digging into the Yeah, starting from scratch and then the third call would be Ben and I digging in like reviewing their existing system and stuff.

Unknown Speaker  55:02
Yeah, I think the first thing I'm looking

Speaker 2  55:09
at to say so I'm looking at the email or the Yeah, that we put in there. So the first call is going to be intro onboarding, start digging into needs in the existing system. And then the Tuesday and Thursday calls don't have what exactly would be going along with it.

Unknown Speaker  55:26
Okay

Unknown Speaker  55:34
Okay

Unknown Speaker  55:39
sounds good

Unknown Speaker  55:47
cool. Yeah, it'll be doable

Speaker 1  56:04
Okay, very good. Well, then we'll plan to talk again later on the team call.

Unknown Speaker  56:10
Okay, sounds good.

Unknown Speaker  56:14
Yep, thanks.
