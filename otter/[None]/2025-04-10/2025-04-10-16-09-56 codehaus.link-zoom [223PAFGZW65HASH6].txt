Unknown Speaker  01:45
All right,

Matthias Miller  01:49
so here under automation, we've got round robin, where I've dropped that stuff In. We have got form slash chat. We're adding, adding the auto created tag, and then we also, you said, auto created chat. Is that what you

Speaker 1  02:10
wanted? So we would like an auto created phone, auto created form, auto created chat, so it distinguishes

Matthias Miller  02:19
how they what

Unknown Speaker  02:20
stream they showed up in

Matthias Miller  02:22
Play channel. Okay, so let's do so that means we need to form slash chat. Let's duplicate this guy. So we're going to call this guy the chat. Yeah. We're going to change this guy to be the form.

Matthias Miller  02:51
And then we're going to take the form trigger out of this one, so when the customer replies to the chat channel

Unknown Speaker  03:00
doesn't have, I

Matthias Miller  03:04
don't know, we could probably take this condition out. It really doesn't matter.

Unknown Speaker  03:10
Auto created and auto created chat.

Matthias Miller  03:18
I know that's moving fast, but hopefully it makes kind of kind of makes sense, yeah, on the form. Wait a minute. I did this wrong. So this one,

Unknown Speaker  03:36
what did I miss? I

Matthias Miller  03:43
reply to the chat. This one is the chat. This one is supposed to be the form.

Matthias Miller  03:54
And we're going to take the chat trigger out. We're

Matthias Miller  04:03
and there's the form, and then we're going to do auto created form.

Matthias Miller  04:18
So form in the name form and the trigger form and the tag. And then

Matthias Miller  04:33
here I'm going to do one of the things. It's just going to make our life easier. I'm

Matthias Miller  04:47
wait you probably want to. That's why you don't want the

Matthias Miller  04:57
you probably don't want them. Hey. Okay, first attribution, last attribution, sorry, Hang on. Wait. What am I doing?

Unknown Speaker  05:14
Okay, this is or

Matthias Miller  05:18
multiple attribution. Do you want?

Matthias Miller  05:26
Do you want, if somebody, if somebody comes in through multiple channels, do you want them all tagged, generally, the first one tagged,

Speaker 1  05:40
probably just the first one, unless, unless there's an ability to whatever whichever. Because, in theory, the sales guys, the sales person, should respond to whatever the first stream is, unless they send a chat. Sometimes somebody will send a chat and then call right after so maybe the most recent,

Unknown Speaker  06:11
unless that's too hard.

Matthias Miller  06:17
Well, how are you wanting to use this?

Speaker 1  06:21
So this, this, essentially, this is helping us track the breadcrumbs of where the customer initiated with the company. That's the that's the first goal. I guess the second goal, then would a lot gives the salesperson information on like trying to make their job a little bit smoother. But the the primary purpose would just be figuring out how they the stream they entered into our system.

Matthias Miller  06:58
So then I would do the first. I would do the first because

Matthias Miller  07:19
auto created phone. You said,

Speaker 1  07:22
correct? Yeah. So the three would be phone form or chat. And

Matthias Miller  07:27
then I also have another one that I'm using for my own All right, so then it does not include any of those. We add these tags. I

Matthias Miller  07:43
and we could actually

Unknown Speaker  07:47
trying to think of the best way to do this.

Unknown Speaker  07:54
Better idea. I

Matthias Miller  08:09
we're going to do

Unknown Speaker  08:14
forms, we're

Matthias Miller  08:16
going to do

Speaker 2  08:19
chats. We're this

Matthias Miller  08:35
would be tag does not include I

Matthias Miller  08:45
then we all right if the tag does not include any of the other creates, and we're actually going to change this to auto created chat, I'm um, I know, but you should, why are you not? There we go. And now let's do calls. So once again, if sign is empty and

Unknown Speaker  09:22
tag,

Unknown Speaker  09:37
we are going to I'm

Matthias Miller  09:55
and then round robin, auto created I'm.

Matthias Miller  10:06
Okay, now let's do this then,

Unknown Speaker  10:19
nope, all

Matthias Miller  10:22
right? Well, then this is what we're gonna have to do.

Unknown Speaker  10:33
There's chat. I'm

Unknown Speaker  10:45
there's full form.

Unknown Speaker  10:54
La Boris clicking and phone and publish this guy again.

Matthias Miller  11:08
All right, let's go back to the workflows, and I think we got

Unknown Speaker  11:13
it tag. Do.

Matthias Miller  11:34
Hang on, that's For the sales process. I

Matthias Miller  12:03
do you want TSA to be auto created TSA as well?

Unknown Speaker  12:08
Yeah, that would be good.

Unknown Speaker  12:19
There's catch I

Unknown Speaker  12:27
stop if, well, it

Matthias Miller  12:32
looks like it's a little more than a five minutes. But hey, what's what's a Thursday without a healthy dose, dose of optimism? I All right, so in the tag does not include any of these.

Matthias Miller  12:57
Then we add the TSA, Okay? So this is tag I

Matthias Miller  13:44
so we have these. This one that needs to change Round Robin for contacts calls created all of these. We need to make sure okay. So this one, one final pass through to get everything squared away. So TSA leads, if the TSA tag is added, then if it's not any of these five now and then, we add the auto created TSA good, if we have a form submitted, and it's one of those forms and the tag does not include and we need to add auto create a TSA, and we will add that tag there Good this one, if this does not include TSA. Save, save, save done.

Unknown Speaker  14:48
This one

Matthias Miller  14:50
does not include TSA

Unknown Speaker  14:54
Save,

Matthias Miller  14:56
Save done. This one. Right? This is where we need to

Unknown Speaker  15:03
tag

Unknown Speaker  15:09
chat

Unknown Speaker  15:20
form

Speaker 2  15:40
PSA, I'm all right, 12345, save

Matthias Miller  15:51
234, and we need to add TSA here. I'm

Matthias Miller  16:08
all right,

Speaker 1  16:19
there you go. Should be good. Thank you. Yeah, that's great. Thank you. Eric did mention sorry the last thing, if you go to the dashboard and you look at it says, we have 123 but if you click on the one in that top opportunity status, yeah, if you click on the the There you go. There's one duplicate, right where your mouse is,

Matthias Miller  16:50
but this was the one. I think this is created today. Yes,

Speaker 1  16:54
if as long as you are already aware of it, I'm not worried about it. I was just told to make sure

Matthias Miller  17:00
that was a disgust. Correct thing would be for somebody to delete that one. Okay,

Speaker 1  17:08
is, Well, my question. My question was the lead value is different.

Unknown Speaker  17:14
That's a fair question. Let's go take a look. I

Matthias Miller  17:27
total by 20 by 85021,

Matthias Miller  17:36
72 i

Unknown Speaker  17:46
773,

Unknown Speaker  17:52
21

Speaker 1  17:58
well, I guess it looks like one of them says it's in production, so the one that's not in production, we could delete.

Matthias Miller  18:06
Okay? I mean, I'm just gonna assume that somewhere, something got finalized, and there's a slight difference between the quotes, but

Matthias Miller  18:22
I uh, but without knowing what changed on it, I wouldn't know.

Unknown Speaker  18:27
Okay, that's fine.

Matthias Miller  18:31
Okay, so you said the one to delete would be the one in

Speaker 1  18:36
so that was, well, actually, yeah, I guess I don't know this is the

Matthias Miller  18:41
one this is the one that got created. It looks like I would be inclined to delete this one and then move the other one into sold one. Well, move the other one into production. Actually,

Unknown Speaker  18:56
okay, I'm okay with that. It looks like it was auto created. I wonder if it was a

Matthias Miller  19:06
TSA. I know it's related to stuff I was doing. I'm pretty confident that it was so let me. Let me go into Okay. Brian Harrison, that might be easier to delete them from in here.

Unknown Speaker  19:30
Filters, not followers, not owner. Well,

Unknown Speaker  19:48
Brian with an eye, no, it's one I.

Unknown Speaker  20:03
One. This one, I believe this one is in production,

Matthias Miller  20:16
created April 7. Let's go see when the other one was created. I

Unknown Speaker  20:23
April six.

Matthias Miller  20:39
I really don't know.

Speaker 1  20:42
Okay, that's fine. I guess my my only concern was, if my only concern was it being replicated as a continuous problem. But if I

Matthias Miller  20:55
don't think it is and I'm fine, I mean, I I do believe there is 502172

Unknown Speaker  21:07
let me do this one more time, 50272

Matthias Miller  21:10
and I don't remember Where there was the other 15027,

Matthias Miller  21:22
wait, this one doesn't have it. This one never got a processed order ID,

Matthias Miller  21:33
so this is probably the better one to delete. So how did we not recognize the what was happening on the sixth the seventh. I

Matthias Miller  22:44
Hey, here's what it is we are looking at. He marked it closed before it was processed. Okay,

Speaker 1  23:01
well, that's good. That's good. Then that we thank you for tracking that down, because we'll tell the guys, don't do that, because it messes things up. It will auto close. It'll auto close. Okay, that sounds good.

Matthias Miller  23:15
And we can, I mean, we can change the behavior. I'm open to that, but currently we're only looking at open opportunity opportunities if, if there is none, yeah, I'm going to make a comment. If the salesperson closes the opportunity prior to us assigning an order number, it will create a duplicate opportunity. In this case, we should make sure we aren't losing any notes and delete the original

Speaker 2  23:58
opportunity, the one with order number, or transfer all information To the original order number to the original opportunity I'm

Matthias Miller  24:22
okay, so, yeah, in this case, there doesn't, here's where I'm just a little bit torn.

Unknown Speaker  24:33
I don't think it really,

Matthias Miller  24:39
but it really doesn't look like there's that much information tied specifically to this. No, I think in this case, I will

Speaker 2  24:48
delete this guy. Yeah, I think that's funny, okay,

Matthias Miller  24:53
and then here there's also, if. Opportunity value within update next time it it moves to the next stage, and he had a source for chat widget,

Speaker 1  25:08
yeah. Okay, great, yeah. Thank you so much. I the last thing that I just remembered is I've been working with life Asher and life X and I'm trying to pinpoint him, I keep telling them our phones are not ringing enough. We're not getting as much leads as we would like. You know, the the long, long, living story of tension between sales and marketing, and so coming from the sales side, it's like, I want to make it marketing's problem that we don't have enough. I feels like the funnel needs to be bigger. In that he was pulling data from HubSpot, and it seems like Ash, I don't know. Did ash ever connect with you about how to find accurate lead information in in high level or No,

Matthias Miller  26:06
I never heard from him. No, okay,

Speaker 1  26:07
that's fine. I so then the one thing that he actually mentioned in my monthly report, or CSC monthly report, was he would be open to hiring you as a consultant to see how life X is performing with CSC for lead generations. So I don't know if, I don't know if that's something that you'd be interested in, but because and how you got brought into it was, I've referenced Yoders overall revenue, and I said, Hey, the revenue is just our revenue is not where we want it. I want it higher. They were able to get it higher, and Matthias was part of that. And so I feel like, I mean, I've, I've increased our budget from since, since your years, your discovery report, and it's starting to pick up. Obviously, the economy is doing its own thing. And so there's, there definitely are outliers. But anyways, would you like me to if you're open to that, what I would do is connect with I'll connect with Asher and just say hey, Matthias would be open to that, and then let him connect with you directly, because my understanding is he said Life x would hire you to do that Sure? Yeah, I'm open to

Matthias Miller  27:44
that.

Unknown Speaker  27:48
I suspect,

Matthias Miller  27:52
well, just from what I know, yeah, one of the

Matthias Miller  28:11
I'm going to put, well, I don't Know About The we're not running any Facebook traffic. I I can look at things on the marketing side instinctively, and I'm happy to talk to him. I don't mind that. I don't mind getting paid to look at stuff the I think the sales, the sales side is really where I feel like I uh,

Matthias Miller  28:45
that's where I think there are some things that we could implement on the on the sales side, okay, they could. I want to look at that diagnosis without or prescription without diagnosis is malpractice. So I don't really want to say this, but I should be careful how much speculation I do. But I'm speculating that we are I'm speculating that we're gonna, we're gonna catch some gaps in the sales side that we need to

Speaker 1  29:18
fix and that probably, we probably should do that before we do anything else.

Matthias Miller  29:23
I would think so. I mean, if you have, I mean, the if you can bump your, mean, the crazy thing is, if you, if you bump your close rate by, if you're 5% close rate, and you bump it up to 10, you've just got your marketing cost in half. So I I would personally, just from everything I know, it could be that life X is absolutely atrocious at their work, and it's, you know, I don't know Sure, but just from what I know, that's where I would look first.

Speaker 1  29:57
Yeah, no, that's good wisdom. Yeah. And I, I'm, I'm absolutely open to the fact that it could be, I could have a booger hanging out of my nose, and someone just has to tell me about it. And so, so

Matthias Miller  30:09
here, here's what I don't know. I also don't know how to get a good feel for this. One of the things I loved with being at Yoders was I I just get a kick out of sales meetings and clearing roadblocks for for guys, and I don't know, on the basically making the sales process as seamless as possible. I, I think everybody, well, I don't know. I pretty, pretty candidly, I got hit pretty hard at q1 and so and so the I have like, a bajillion thoughts while trying to get out of the out of my mouth at the same time, there is something real about the state of the economy. People do argue with with me about these things and say that it's all about mental state, and the salesperson can overcome stuff, and I think it's both. And I have heard from a lot of different directions that consumers, the state of mind for consumers is a 911 COVID mindset right now, and that's just that that ends up becoming a very difficult battle to fight, to fight. But it can also be they can also get in a salesperson said at the same time. So I don't, I don't really like complete helplessness either. With that, and I feel like,

Matthias Miller  31:54
sorry, and now I lost all the other thoughts of what I was trying to say. Anyway, it's been, it's been, it's been.

Matthias Miller  32:10
I'll just say this, it feels good to be at this point, to be this far in with the CRM that we can actually start looking at making some tactical changes to how we run things. Yeah, absolutely. And,

Speaker 1  32:22
yeah, yeah. So in I'd be, if you'd be open to getting coffee sometime, I think it'd be good. I don't know if it's a, I mean, if, if it's more of like a Matthias And Jesse conversation and CSC and Matthias conversation, but I think you have, you have really good perspective. And on my it could be CSC, because CSC is investing in my development, but I yeah, I mean, I think I just, I thrive off of honest, constructive feedback. And so Eric and I had a good, good quarterly meeting the other day, and it was just really good for me to hear his experience working with me. So if you'd be open to that, at some point, I would like to treat you to I know you drink tea. I'll treat you to tea.

Matthias Miller  33:21
So we'll have to find the place that has matcha in stock, because the color is out because of tariffs. They said, so

Speaker 1  33:27
Oh no, or whatever. Maybe we needed to tell them that we'll just increase the price. We need our matcha.

Matthias Miller  33:36
We do need our matcha. It's like this is ordering on. I mean, this is just about enough to turn me into a Trump hater. Yeah, I might, I might become political. Yeah, I don't know. Just wait, that's right, that's right, yeah, well, let me know. I mean, if it's, if it's me and Jesse, then it's a it's it's a breakfast or it's a Saturday or Sunday afternoon coffee, and I don't know what your weekends are like, and if it's not that, then potentially it's in the middle of the week. But candidly, I you know, I don't know, like you got to bill your time. I hear you juggling and exactly. So, yeah, I'm happy either way. Okay, so just, I guess, let me know what your general schedule is like. On the personal front, it's going to go through me, not Audrey, if it's during, if it's if it's CSC time, then it's Audra, can be in the loop and help get it arranged. Okay,

Speaker 1  34:35
honestly, breakfast, a breakfast meeting, would be great. So if there's a morning or day of the week that's better for you then

Matthias Miller  34:44
other days that are good for you, bad for you. Mondays

Speaker 1  34:47
are bad for me. Any other day I have Monday through Friday or or sorry, Tuesday through Friday, I can I have a lot of flexibility. Weekends are a little bit harder.

Matthias Miller  35:00
And we can do

Matthias Miller  35:11
and how early

Speaker 1  35:14
I can meet, as early as a place will open so

Matthias Miller  35:21
bugs opens it. Yeah,

Speaker 1  35:23
Mike opens at six. I think village in was opening again at either I think 630 I've been there at 630 and they're not open. But they've never not been open at seven.

Matthias Miller  35:36
I could do six to 715 ish on Thursday,

Speaker 1  35:41
six on Thursday. Yeah, let's plan. Let's plan on it.

Matthias Miller  35:45
I am sending you an invite now, and I'll put bugs on there. Awesome. I am biased towards them, so let my personal bias come out. That's great. I

Unknown Speaker  35:55
enjoy the breakfast. I appreciate that. Awesome. Thanks, man. You have a great thanks.

Matthias Miller  36:06
Well, goodbye.
