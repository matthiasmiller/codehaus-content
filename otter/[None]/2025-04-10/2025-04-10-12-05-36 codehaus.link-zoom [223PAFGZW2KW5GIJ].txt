Okay, I'm having trouble with the API and being able to create opportunities, so I'm just going to show you what's going on right now. So I have here my token filled in. I've got the bearer, got the version number, I've got the payload in here, and all of this stuff I've pulled from an existing from an existing opportunity. Just to make sure it's clear, I hit Send API request. It says the token does not have access to this location. Okay. Well, interesting. So let's go take the token. It's 1206, right now, by the way. And I go over into into here, and I put the token in here, I put the the ID that I used to to pull this information from, I hit Send API request, and there you go. Well, that came through. I come over here and and I use, use that same ID. Let's put in the authorization here. I run it, boom, here's all this information, and that works as well, but apparently, creating opportunity, it says the token doesn't have access to this location. Even though I'm able to update community opportunity status, I'm able to get the opportunity, but I cannot create opportunities because the token does not have access. So there you go. I'd love to have help you.
