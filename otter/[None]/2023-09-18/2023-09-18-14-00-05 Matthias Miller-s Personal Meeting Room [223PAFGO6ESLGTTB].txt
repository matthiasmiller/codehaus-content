Unknown Speaker  00:49

Unknown Speaker  01:17

Unknown Speaker  01:50
hi you too finally good to

Unknown Speaker  01:57
be with us drive ahead

Matthias Miller  01:59
alright so I don't know that much has changed since last time we talked most of what well but I guess rip through this payroll module is on my list to do hopefully this week some time I'm planning to take quite a bit of time this week working on this stuff spent most of the day working on the AR process and specking out fun things like this like your debit and credit schedule for everything that needs to happen

Unknown Speaker  02:43
whose code counting a or that part? Is that you

Matthias Miller  02:47
Yeah, it is it's me. Yep. Josh did you go ahead and start on taxed or were you still wanting to be happy to still talk to Mark about whether that's actually necessary?

Unknown Speaker  03:00
I talked about it

Unknown Speaker  03:04
good work okay

Matthias Miller  03:16
so that's is that sorry So what's this what's the status again?

Speaker 1  03:21
So I would put it in a 2024 deliverable

Unknown Speaker  03:26
yeah

Unknown Speaker  03:37
okay

Matthias Miller  03:42
liquidation for Asset Management just threw some notes in there I'll come back and bring it up some time is up the ACH needs to be documented working on FTA allocation this is all testing under his word. As I recall though, we had I don't think I threw this in there

Matthias Miller  04:18
if your changes with asset management which I thought I had put into a change request

Unknown Speaker  04:30
try

Matthias Miller  04:43
do you know what the status is in this tool?

Speaker 2  04:47
The high priority portion is done. I think I created a child job and client scope on that

Unknown Speaker  04:58
I'm

Speaker 2  05:02
Matthias sorry Josh when was the last the last live deployment for

Unknown Speaker  05:12
their database ago

Unknown Speaker  05:14
I think we need to but

Speaker 2  05:20
this was okay 15865

Unknown Speaker  05:30
I'm just trying to remember when this was

Unknown Speaker  05:35
done

Speaker 2  05:44
okay, so yeah that was 914 so Corolla has not been deployed

Unknown Speaker  05:57
is that a request for an update?

Unknown Speaker  05:58
Yes please. How quickly

Unknown Speaker  06:08
can you speak to that

Matthias Miller  06:09
today or tomorrow we'd be nice through we'll be working on it again Wednesday

Unknown Speaker  06:24
whoa

Matthias Miller  06:30
All right. So we'll go over that bear with them

Matthias Miller  06:38
is there anything you need from me on students this Hey

Unknown Speaker  06:58
oh we

Unknown Speaker  06:59
haven't actually specified accounting live date have we?

Matthias Miller  07:04
No, it should be a wanted as a system switch

Unknown Speaker  07:09
yeah probably

Unknown Speaker  07:25
let's quantities on a string

Matthias Miller  07:41
will rate Kenny live Davis that's not very modular. You're gonna want to do that

Unknown Speaker  07:51
alright, so that again

Matthias Miller  07:53
this is not going to be very

Unknown Speaker  07:57
modular very general. Asset Management Yeah. All right

Unknown Speaker  08:12
we could call it

Unknown Speaker  08:27
just call it

Unknown Speaker  08:29
Yeah. Sure.

Unknown Speaker  08:47
Okay, so let's also get this over into here Okay.

Unknown Speaker  09:03
Moving these

Unknown Speaker  09:06
I think that's actually good review.

Speaker 3  09:13
Jonah, see who hasn't has a code reviewed? Double check on them that will tell us a fair bit. Joel, have you done your part?

Speaker 2  09:21
A Yes. Unless new stuff has showed up. I don't remember if I had feedback. 16 revisions? No, no. I started reviewing. Okay.

Speaker 4  09:35
Yeah. So

Matthias Miller  09:46
invoicing processes, and then there's a whole host of stuff that's in Mike word. I'm focusing on the next Yikes, two weeks. This is kind of crazy.

Unknown Speaker  10:00
Joel is out most next week.

Unknown Speaker  10:08
This week, actually, this

Speaker 3  10:10
week this week guest this week actually, is better and worse when I'm out next week as as Josh for several days

Matthias Miller  10:22
because of a philosophical objection to pushing payroll module changes out till October I guess I can negotiate that.

Speaker 3  11:01
The needs and what was on these needs design? Which ones are actually critical for August 31, or September? Are they all or are these certain ones?

Unknown Speaker  11:25
Well,

Matthias Miller  11:28
the most critical is sales order impacts. An invoicing process probably. Check printing would probably be the ideal this needs to be cleaned up. I think transaction verification reports pretty simple. This can be pushed out it's spinach. This is probably something that should be done. I don't know that it absolutely has to be done.

Unknown Speaker  11:57
I could that went over to October, for example.

Unknown Speaker  12:00
Yeah.

Speaker 5  12:05
Start pushing some of this stuff in 2518 805.

Matthias Miller  12:25
One's actually probably 75 to the bottom of the list. This I think it's still just mostly cleanup, check printing

Speaker 3  12:38
cash, we've looked at cash flows, we think it's complex enough that if Saturn equity here, we might have them coded. But I think it's too complex to send a bomb with ash. And so Joel is thinking of coding it himself.

Matthias Miller  12:54
Do you mean, go ahead? Okay, let me know, if you I don't know what my schedule or availability is? Let me know if it'd be if you want help on the coding side of that. I don't know that. I want to own it in core accounting long term. But sure.

Speaker 3  13:17
I mean, I think Joel has a basic idea down, it's just, um, detail screens and reports and fields worked pretty well. Algorithms and stuff just doesn't long distance. And so I tend to have those done stateside. And this one, this one is all about. I mean, it's not complex stuff, but it is it's it is a bit abstract. With lots of models and stuff like that,

Matthias Miller  13:48
so So are we still on track for the end of the month? Or is this going to bump into October? So

Speaker 3  13:56
Joe, how long do you think would actually be if you and Matthias Well, that's expensive but if you and Matthias pair program at or if you pair program it I mean, you talk it through with with is and then disappear. Do you think it's more than a day of work for you? Two days?

Speaker 2  14:14
Four days a chance. What came to mind? Offhand was three Well, yeah

Speaker 3  14:29
if it's pure program, do you think it would go substantially faster?

Unknown Speaker  14:41
Or if you and

Unknown Speaker  14:42
I are to answer, but we can't

Unknown Speaker  14:44
we don't overlap.

Speaker 3  15:03
Because I almost wonder if you would have a careless, precarious code or like Matthias or myself driving forward? And you said the background and thinking and wave flags it was, it might be faster than if you code it could be? I don't know, I'm just Yeah. Or, well, I was driving ahead with one piece, then you go. So wait a second, we've got something over here we can use for that, etc, kind of avoiding the spinning out and

Unknown Speaker  15:38
yet started force rapid clarity?

Speaker 2  15:50
I don't know. Matthias, do you think it's worth and experiment?

Unknown Speaker  15:59
Might be

Unknown Speaker  16:04
not opposed to an experiment.

Speaker 3  16:07
I mean, I guess one thing you could do is do do half a day together some time and see, see how much progress you make? And then I don't know, maybe I'll let the two of you work on that offline.

Speaker 1  16:23
I'm with us. Like, she was like a whole bunch of stuff. Further up. That's got your name on it.

Unknown Speaker  16:27
Yeah. I don't know. I mean,

Matthias Miller  16:34
well, it depends how much we're willing to push, push off until October. I mean, we are saying there's some of the stuff that is going to be October.

Speaker 3  16:41
I kind of think Josh may be right to though. And it really depends on what capacity you have in the next

Matthias Miller  16:49
one I was, I was not imagining I was imagining it's maybe half day to a day, it was not imagining that it would be a three day project. So it literally is three days.

Speaker 3  17:04
Well, it's not three days for both of you. I don't think I mean,

Unknown Speaker  17:07
yeah, I think that's right.

Speaker 3  17:11
Because even if, I mean, I would guess that only four hours is getting the skeleton in place. Which even that may be valuable. And, and then to get closer to wrapping it up is another well, you don't have to be there for all the wrap up. So, you know, potentially another four hours, make a lot more progress, or you just you just bailiff at four hours. So I think it's it's I think it's a, it's eight to six. If we do it this way. It's going to take eight to 16 of Joel's time. And it's gonna take four to eight viewers. But I'm trying to think what the other solutions are. I mean, another interesting question, Joe would be, you know, what could you and I whack out in? You're not back until Friday Anyway, are you back on Friday or not?

Unknown Speaker  18:15
No, I'm traveling on Sunday. And I'm

Speaker 3  18:17
working. I'm working remotely part time on Monday. So that's not an option and traveling Tuesday through Thursday. So

Matthias Miller  18:30
I mean, I can I've got was going to work on any shareholder slash

Unknown Speaker  18:38
don't know.

Matthias Miller  18:42
dashboard type of stuff, possibly next Thursday. We can either either block out time on and I can I can reschedule. I've got a call on Monday with Mark that I could kill that would give me most of the day on Monday as well.

Speaker 2  19:02
When you talk about next Thursday, are you referring to this week or next week?

Unknown Speaker  19:07
So I was traveling this Thursday?

Matthias Miller  19:12
I could do that the 25th or 28th for extended periods, extended blocks I believe

Unknown Speaker  19:19
gotcha.

Speaker 2  19:22
I mean Monday would probably be if we're looking at building a foundation and and my building on top of the foundation Monday would be preferable Thursday.

Matthias Miller  19:40
Let's let's do this. What time What time would you want to start on that day if we do?

Speaker 2  19:56
Let's see Oh, okay. I need to shift to the correct day.

Unknown Speaker  20:04
yikes

Unknown Speaker  20:09
I have stuff at least tentatively booked till 1pm

Matthias Miller  20:16
I mean I could do tool to write I could do you see one

Unknown Speaker  20:21
Yeah 12 Your times my 12 Oh

Unknown Speaker  20:44
Are you saying you do have some time and that

Matthias Miller  20:48
I mean that we'd have time up until our SWAT call we'd also canceller SWAT call I could probably free my day probably freedom afternoon and go up until five

Speaker 2  20:58
central I mean, you know one interesting experiment would be just to see okay, so

Unknown Speaker  21:07
from

Speaker 2  21:11
from 12 Your time or if you want to start just a bit later for lunch or something up until the SWAT call

Unknown Speaker  21:22
what

Speaker 2  21:25
what value could we create in that time?

Unknown Speaker  21:32
Okay, well,

Speaker 3  21:33
here's another possibility Joe will help badly Are you booked today for code reviews? Fairly badly, aren't you?

Unknown Speaker  21:42
Yeah, unfortunately.

Unknown Speaker  21:45
Close my eyes to cut over and I hit it for two hours.

Speaker 2  21:49
Well, no one thing is a I think I'm decently close to done on my investor to on the investor tools side of things. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  22:00
Which is the only thing that that's what matters the most as far as percent

Unknown Speaker  22:03
of metrics Yeah.

Speaker 3  22:09
I do have a potential call with David Volcom. But I'm asking him if he if cutover should

Unknown Speaker  22:15
trump that so?

Unknown Speaker  22:18
Sure. Oh, okay.

Speaker 3  22:21
Oh, he's 12 revisions into an ad tune revision review. He needs to bail out okay

Unknown Speaker  22:43
what do you find that

Speaker 3  22:43
Jeff have a skeleton spinning in an office chair funding are not

Unknown Speaker  22:53
quite likely.

Matthias Miller  22:55
In the interest of this, I will still send you jolis and invite Monday afternoon we can connect them RingCentral cool, you guys that's not necessary. And I'll plan to be free with my call with Mark before then which might need some readjustments Audra. And then let's also when we take a look at this stuff tomorrow, let's also make sure that it's trying to get some kind of general scope as far as how much time I'm actually going to require to get all this other stuff down and make sure I'm not over committing but I think it should be good. Good. Well, that's fun

Unknown Speaker  23:37
and then glitter sections

Unknown Speaker  23:45
in the queue?

Unknown Speaker  23:45
Yeah. I

Matthias Miller  23:50
wouldn't say this is a nice to have, and we're not actually gonna get through it.

Speaker 3  23:53
I think so. I don't think I don't think it has to be there for the first release. Sure. The well and the other thing I've toyed with, it's too cheesy to do, but if they'd really think they need to see it in on Sept on October 1, we could just create parent accounts that would would be there to give the framework I'm not really recommending it but it would be possible if you'd stick in parent accounts for each of the sections, I don't even know that quite give you the report you need to be close. But I think we can just say we're doing it in first half of October we're prioritizing cash flows so

Unknown Speaker  24:37
yep. Sounds good.

Matthias Miller  24:49
Um, right, so it's gonna be a bit of a sprint the next few weeks but I think we have a fighting chance of getting This stuff. Yeah,

Speaker 3  25:02
I mean, if anything, it looks to me like Matthias you're the one that's more of the most booked out. Do you want to have, although his schedule is he's not doesn't have full blocks that's gonna say, Well, do you need a foil for some of this time, but I'm not sure I have any more what I've got to offer Are you just gonna put on headphones and hunker down?

Unknown Speaker  25:27
There you go

Unknown Speaker  25:36
great, awesome. We call that good.

Matthias Miller  25:40
Thanks. So we should be going over. Josh. Q. Anything you've had?

Unknown Speaker  25:48
Or you said something? I missed it.

Speaker 3  25:50
Oh, is there anything that you've got to add? Oh,

Speaker 1  25:53
no, I'm choosing technical debt, converting them over or converting them away from Legacy organizations.

Unknown Speaker  26:00
Sorry, I'm gonna drop here and let y'all change stuff.

Unknown Speaker  26:06
And I'm gonna follow

Speaker 3  26:07
us. Okay. See? Oh, sorry. I got a call from my accountant.

Unknown Speaker  26:13
You need anything from you with us?

Speaker 5  26:14
No, not at this point.

Speaker 1  26:18
So we had talked last time about me taking transaction verification report. Is that still something you want me to consider? Are you happy to do it?

Matthias Miller  26:29
I think I'm happy to do it. I think by the time I spec it out, you know, I don't know it's about it's a 30 to 60 minute.

Unknown Speaker  26:38
Deal. Anyway. Good. I like it. Awesome. Thanks. Have a great one.
