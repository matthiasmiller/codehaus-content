Speaker 1  00:32
That being any better. You're still glitching freezing. I'm going to start my restart my computer.

Matthias Miller  01:05
My computer is freezing on my end. I have no idea what's going on. It's very odd. I I think that

Speaker 1  04:37
all right, let's see. Let's see who, what, what? Who fixed what?

Matthias Miller  04:43
Who fixed what? But who we are, at least

Speaker 1  04:47
well, clearly it's seems to be not, not hesitating now.

Matthias Miller  04:52
So, all right, so we have EPO values gone. We have an update. Um, yeah, we good, all right, well,

Speaker 1  05:18
um, so you had started, are we going to the past due thingy? Yeah, we are. You had started a chart, a bar chart for the past due values on a per monthly basis, a stacked bar chart. That one's good. I

Unknown Speaker  05:45
This guy,

Unknown Speaker  05:47
and that can't be right, so, oh,

Matthias Miller  05:51
come on, so picky.

Speaker 1  05:54
Well, there's, there's no way your current is going to be Current all the way across. I We

Unknown Speaker  06:09
okay

Matthias Miller  06:12
some color.

Matthias Miller  06:27
Uh, hang on,

Matthias Miller  06:44
what's it not right? Looking at the MPA periods,

Matthias Miller  07:06
I Oh, Um,

Unknown Speaker  07:41
really you

Matthias Miller  08:00
why wouldn't You call it the due date?

Unknown Speaker  08:37
What you think?

Speaker 1  08:41
What's the red? Red is 91 plus.

Unknown Speaker  08:55
Hang on.

Matthias Miller  09:29
Let's make sure you got this right. The due date is on or before the asset date, and it's not paid.

Matthias Miller  09:46
And then we find the earliest end date. Of

Matthias Miller  11:58
so We get fees.

Unknown Speaker  12:19
Please do all

Matthias Miller  12:27
right, this is totally not working. We want to find i

Unknown Speaker  13:45
i needed

Matthias Miller  14:08
okay, this is obnoxious. There's got to be a simpler way to do this.

Matthias Miller  14:17
So we are looking

Matthias Miller  15:35
So we want I'm

Unknown Speaker  16:50
we live

Matthias Miller  17:19
Don't Do this.

Unknown Speaker  19:07
So here we have.

Unknown Speaker  25:52
Million percent

Unknown Speaker  26:16
Oh, that City Betterment looks cool.

Matthias Miller  26:32
Okay, so if the entry is on or before, then we take the period.

Matthias Miller  27:16
I was right, but it could

Speaker 1  27:20
be okay. So what is August's number two? We have a total of, do the numbers match your pie chart for August?

Matthias Miller  27:33
Oh,

Unknown Speaker  27:35
well. I mean, for current, I guess it would

Matthias Miller  27:37
be current. We have 268,

Speaker 1  27:41
so, I mean, we're in September, so it could be slightly different.

Matthias Miller  27:48
Well, we could add, temporarily, 268, 68

Speaker 1  28:04
Wait, what did you add that? Oh, you added September to it. Yeah, yeah, when you would want to, you want to keep September there?

Matthias Miller  28:14
One to 3622, 1212, I mean, it's not exactly the same, although this should really be. I

Matthias Miller  28:46
912, 18 912, 1813 it's off by 267, it's off by one between the two so

Speaker 1  29:05
but why? Okay, if you're supposedly capturing snapshots at that point in time, why do we is blue 30 days? Yeah, why don't we have any other past due in those days? There's those time ranges. Obviously September is working. So it may be, just be what we did with the

Matthias Miller  29:23
data. I think it's what we did with the data.

Unknown Speaker  29:27
So that's

Matthias Miller  29:37
because I think, as I recall, it was a plus or minus within a 30 day period like we never

Speaker 1  29:52
I would have thought that the tops of your your bars would vary some, because it would be that would be your total amount of contracts. And you we did close like there should be opens and closes in that time frame.

Matthias Miller  30:07
How do we determine,

Speaker 1  30:10
are you, are you saying only contracts for the entire time frame? Right?

Matthias Miller  30:14
But let's see what happens when we have them all in here. See when we have them all, we don't have a way to exclude

Matthias Miller  30:28
what we should do Here.

Matthias Miller  30:39
Where

Matthias Miller  30:53
there we go, let's do it.

Unknown Speaker  31:00
Okay, what happened to August? Um,

Matthias Miller  31:40
the event due date we're doing. Well, what if we did this? I'm going to include.

Matthias Miller  31:59
I am so sloughing these numbers, it's still not

Unknown Speaker  32:10
we're including. We're including. Wait.

Matthias Miller  32:20
Was this actually necessary? Let me take a look.

Matthias Miller  32:29
So we want to find anything where the Period End Date is less than or equal to the last date of the of the due date. I think that's fair. Something like that.

Speaker 1  32:53
That thing might be 100% right. The only bad part is, I don't know if I want to show it, because really I have this nervous feeling that it's our data that is not going to give us good results because of what we manufactured to be fair. Matthias, there is nothing like this in RTO Pro or anywhere I've ever seen and essentially, like, the only way we've ever created this kind of stuff is we store this on a weekly basis in a spreadsheet a fixed number point in time, so that we can actually, you know, build graphs like this out of spreadsheets. And we're trying to build something that has not been done so far.

Matthias Miller  33:41
Right? I mean, we could make up.

Matthias Miller  34:00
Seems to me like I just don't know. This is going to be one of those things where it's not completely 100% clear that we have the right numbers even with the data that we have. I think we might be

Speaker 1  34:20
so in that case, then we probably would be better to go put together a dashboard on that would encompass like, let's just go, let's go capture like, like, that's right, that's good, putting that in and doing a doing a report of customers that are past due, grouped by 3060, 90s, 90 plus as a report. And then we'll put in the we'll put three things in this dashboard. We'll put that the revenue potential, one. We'll put this pie chart in, and we'll, we'll put in a a list of customers that are currently past due, and we'll call that for the for the time being, we'll call that the past due dashboard. I think that could actually look pretty good. I don't want to show this thing because I don't, I don't know if I believe in it, and it might be 100% right. Here's the thing Matthias, the moment we load in a company's real data, we can go, we can go, defend our you know, we, we can, we can do better job. We just don't know right now, because we manufactured payment data.

Matthias Miller  35:41
So

Speaker 1  36:57
yeah, and we can, we can disregard anybody who's current in this just the just past dues?

Speaker 1  37:13
Or I should say 31 to 60 would be your first would be your First group. And

Matthias Miller  37:28
a little sanity check here.

Matthias Miller  37:42
So here,

Matthias Miller  37:48
rental fee was due on 823 we are 20 some days. No, it was due on 823 No, I mean this is, this is past due.

Speaker 1  38:02
Yeah, you that that first, that one to 30, you can just completely disregard. You don't care if they're past due. The not been one to 30. We want to start. We want to start reporting on past due 31, to 60. Okay?

Unknown Speaker  38:40
There you go.

Speaker 1  38:49
Like that, like that. Grand and let's put in, let's put in address, email and phone number stuff.

Matthias Miller  39:20
I remember both primary and secondary.

Unknown Speaker  39:28
Just primary.

Unknown Speaker  41:00
Probably make those globals.

Matthias Miller  41:05
Well, Actually,

Matthias Miller  41:13
yeah, we'll get there.

Unknown Speaker  41:27
Hey, there you Go.

Matthias Miller  42:21
I like that. I

Speaker 1  42:22
like that a lot. Although let's, let's put I don't like the past due balance being out at the end. Do I like that? I don't know. It's fine. Sort of, well, okay, if we're going to do this, we really should have one of the we should Probably have contract balance, an EPO And, well, yeah, it's

Unknown Speaker  43:14
Yeah, yeah,

Speaker 1  43:22
it may be valuable to just have their regular monthly rent, no, no, the pasty balance, EPO imbalance in contract. That's good. I like that. I like that a lot. And we'll put this across the bottom of the dashboard, and then the other two, the the donut chart and the and the potential revenue. One can be top left and right. This one, yeah,

Matthias Miller  43:53
let's do the it is the aging one. I'm gonna do this one down below, Favorites and Favorites to.

Unknown Speaker  45:07
Look at that.

Matthias Miller  45:17
You want to call it. Just

Unknown Speaker  45:20
call it past you, back past your dashboard for, past your dashboard for

Speaker 1  45:28
and then I don't know what i What did I do in the other dashboard? I did it. I did something company overview for Dwayne's are like, where did I get the Yeah, there you go. I think I added a vs company to it

Matthias Miller  45:43
that pretends to work.

Speaker 1  45:45
Yes, it pretends to work. I know there's, there's a better way to do it, but we're pretending we love all right. Leanne is here within her couple minutes. All right, as soon as just pop open that, that past due dashboard, and let's see what she thinks of this past two dashboard.

Unknown Speaker  46:10
Come on run. Get your

Speaker 1  46:15
3060, 90s. You have your breakdown of the donut. You got your potential versus revenue. It'll work for a nice little past due dashboard.

Speaker 2  46:21
Thingamajigger, so what have you changed since I saw it

Speaker 1  46:26
last? This the the other one was just the overview, company overview. This is the past due dashboard, okay, all right, let's dive into numbers.

Matthias Miller  46:36
Okay, so I

Matthias Miller  46:49
there's a few different Okay, so EPOS are showing fractional cent balances, so I don't know if we care, but do we care?

Speaker 2  47:07
So why are there so many balances that are showing zero, like small cent? These are these are EPO. These are EPOS. These are paid off accounts. These are yes that you just need to go in. They basically a bookkeeper has to justify the small fractional cent differences.

Matthias Miller  47:28
Oh, we need to handle sales tax rounding effectively.

Speaker 1  47:32
Gotcha, is that where we're getting into it, sales tax rounding? Yeah.

Matthias Miller  47:36
I don't remember the full details, but that's basically it. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  47:44
I mean, I feel like you're gonna have, you're gonna have a lot of

Speaker 1  47:47
well, we just, we just won't show payoffs. We'll only show active contracts. We won't show anybody that's paid off.

Speaker 2  47:56
I mean, most of the time we we sort our contracts by active only, which means they're not paid off. But yes, you want the ability to go run a report on paid off, on what was this?

Matthias Miller  48:10
These are ones that are flagged as a payout, and not all payouts have been $0 balance.

Speaker 1  48:19
I think, I think we would be safe to stay, we stay in the active contract.

Speaker 2  48:25
Stay away from, let's stay away from the squirrely business.

Unknown Speaker  48:29
Yes, okay,

Matthias Miller  48:30
that leaves us with this. If we want to, actually, we don't need to do that. Let's just sort by CRA. So CRA remains. I mean, we had looked at this. We

Matthias Miller  48:48
purchased about 8188 the payment amount times 48 CRA amount. We're not showing a breakdown of but, boy, that would be a fascinating exercise.

Speaker 1  49:02
Well, you mean, how you got to the 1706, 53 Yeah, that would be a fascinating exercise, wouldn't it?

Speaker 2  49:09
It sounds like a funny trail to me. Yeah, it is

Matthias Miller  49:12
so contract value minus rent paid plus CRA tax,

Unknown Speaker  49:19
equals A 5320 74

Matthias Miller  49:22
without the CRA taxes, the 5201 rental balance divided By remaining months. Contract balance, 5201 divided by 286

Speaker 1  49:43
equals the 24 point, whatever that is. You got two five months left, and then early cash payoff.

Matthias Miller  49:52
And this is where contract total minus Amount Paid equals the rental balance. There is no unpaid rental fees. So the balance for the EPO is seven odd 1000, which is the rental balance plus CR plus taxable CRA, yep, times EPO percentage of 50% which gives us 3513 add in the taxable CRA. There is no unpaid rental fee balance to add in, which gives us the EPO subtotal by the non taxable CRA, which gives us payoff amount. Did

Speaker 1  50:33
anybody ever do the manual math on that to make sure it actually works,

Matthias Miller  50:38
that these numbers actually come through? Yeah, I think I did okay.

Speaker 2  50:43
Just, just, definitely be a good idea, just for just to run it. I mean, typically do better math than we do, but still,

Speaker 1  50:51
so Well, yes, as long as you, as long as you put the macros in the right place, right, 13, eight, 70.08

Speaker 2  50:59
you know, I'm making fun of when they tell us that assist is wrong, 860, because their spreadsheet said something different. Always makes my head want to equal 6128.

Speaker 1  51:10
Okay, minus, okay, no. Aaron here, numbers

Unknown Speaker  51:13
are not better than assists, promise.

Unknown Speaker  51:21
So wait a minute, what's the balance for EPO?

Matthias Miller  51:25
70, 2201 28 plus, 1820, 590-918-2599,

Unknown Speaker  51:31
is the, is the the tax to

Matthias Miller  51:36
get the balance for EPO, you need it. You need to add in the taxable CRA amount through the rental balance.

Speaker 1  51:44
So the CRA is 17 Oh, yeah, but then you can't add it again later.

Matthias Miller  51:48
Yeah, you can after the EPO.

Speaker 1  51:53
So you're saying 5201 28 is the times 1.07 would be with its tax. 56 Wait, I'm still I'm still lost.

Unknown Speaker  52:04
No, you're gonna do 5201 28 Okay, minus, minus what? 1706 53

Unknown Speaker  52:13
1706 53

Speaker 2  52:15
then you're gonna have to add back in the tax on the 1706 53 that wasn't part

Speaker 1  52:21
of the equation, you're saying, Okay, you're saying 52 Oh 1.2 plus the 17 Oh 63

Unknown Speaker  52:30
Well, you'd want to take that call.

Unknown Speaker  52:33
You're going the wrong way, point 07 Well, the contract

Matthias Miller  52:36
total does not include this.

Speaker 2  52:37
You're going the wrong direction. Excuse me. Okay. Okay,

Speaker 1  52:43
in the vertical stack of math, the 7027, 27 does not make sense.

Matthias Miller  52:48
It is basically Excel spreadsheet that we put together. It is 50 to the rental balance plus this the taxable CRA it's 5201 28 plus 1825, 99

Speaker 2  52:57
so the only, the only part that I think we might have to quibble about it. All is, and this is maybe a convoluted way of my brain thinking about it, so I may be wrong. 5201 28 now we're going to spend the CRA before I do that, I'm going to run a calculation and say, what is the actual tax on 1706 53 and I'm going to write that number down. I'm going to take away 1706 53 from the 5201 28 and I'm going to say that's what I have

Speaker 1  53:27
left. No, you're not. You never take 1706 53 away from the two away. Why? Because the rental balance does not include the CRA.

Matthias Miller  53:34
The contract total is fake CRA reduced contract total,

Unknown Speaker  53:41
right? So you do have to add it in twice.

Matthias Miller  53:45
And the reason for the taxable, non taxable, difference is to to the way we the reason we edit, edit and take it back out is so that we can get the tax equation to work in a way that is

Speaker 2  53:56
correct. Your, your, yeah, your track. I'm tracking now.

Speaker 1  54:00
I still think it's deceptive, deceptive,

Matthias Miller  54:08
round and round and round. And I was pushing for a clear way to explain this. And you insist this, this is okay, filter this in the best possible way. You insisted that this is a clear way to explain the make it taxable, not taxable. Flip. The thing

Unknown Speaker  54:23
worked in his brain. That's what he meant. And

Matthias Miller  54:25
it models, it models how RTO Pro works. Yeah, I just think it's for I agree. It's horribly confusing, but we're not going to find a better we're not going to find a better solution between

Speaker 2  54:38
them, right? Well, I've only got a couple more moments, because I have to, okay, where? But like, this is, this is workable. I feel I understand what's happening here, and I could explain it, but we could also fool with it, if that's what you want to do.

Unknown Speaker  54:57
Okay, where's this? Where is this spreadsheet? You know?

Speaker 2  55:00
Other things to look at besides this, like I don't want to, I don't want to stop on this point. If you have another couple

Matthias Miller  55:07
minutes sheet, the only thing I reran accounting impact was some changes that we made. I just want to sanity check balance sheet. We have 316, checking 281, and AR, which is current contracts, outstanding. We have

Speaker 2  55:25
that much assets, that much in depreciation, right?

Matthias Miller  55:29
AP, which is manufacturer premiums, 100 security deposits in CRA held 15 grand in sales tax through balance equity, so we wouldn't have an upside down checking account, and then this is just year to date revenue for plus manufacturer premiums and depreciation expense, and we're not reporting any gain or loss to avoid people asking questions why there's a few pennies in gain or loss in sale of ask on sale of asset.

Speaker 2  56:04
I mean, I feel like that's a very great high level whatever. And you know, if you have the person who's in there quibbling, well, I want to see this, you can absolutely there can be more accounts visible, if that's what you makes you happy, this can be made to mirror the complexity that

Speaker 1  56:19
you so desire. Well, and we don't have any of the any other expenses that we could and if

Speaker 2  56:24
you don't know how to make it complex, I can, I can introduce you to some people who'd be happy to help.

Matthias Miller  56:33
Thank you for that. Appreciate it. Great, generous. All right. I mean, I think I can't think of anything else? Dwayne, can you think of anything?

Speaker 2  56:43
I mean, all this stuff. I have one thing that's, like, really off topic, but also hilarious, and I have to tell you before I walk out the door. So Marty is having a coronary because Matthias is showing up at the NSRA. So now Marty boltress, so he's like, but Matthias is a vendor at the shed Expo. Are you vendors at his table? No, we're not. Well. Then why is he with you? Well, it's kind of none of your business. We offered that he could come to the NSRA because he's coming in early. Well, now you have to pay $395 each to get in, because now you're coming as vendors, because you're also in the software world, like, like guys, like, Wait, we haven't completed the whole thing yet, but clearly he's in a stew about it. Marty wasn't sure the base of this. I really think he wanted us as vendors there, and we weren't quite ready to do vendor at the shed Expo this year. Maybe we should have been, but it's hilarious, but

Speaker 1  57:35
well, maybe she asked me to help him at the at his table.

Speaker 2  57:39
Listen, if Matthias wants you at the table. They are happy to make you just pay him a little bit, and then you can hang out with Matthias at this table. That would make Marty happy.

Matthias Miller  57:50
I'm bringing a young squirt along, so I don't know, but I'm also probably going to ask some clients to hang around my table after my talk anyway. So I don't know how that's all going to

Speaker 2  57:59
go. I don't know either, but just so you know, we might have to calm Marty down on Sunday when we get there. What on earth I'll and if we need to pay a little more, we just will. But I'm not sure. I'm not sure what's happening. He gets stressed when we get to this point of the shed Expo. He always gets a little stressed so, and understandably, there's a lot of moving parts and pieces, yeah. All right, I gotta go. All right, it's good. Looking forward to seeing you

Matthias Miller  58:28
likewise.

Unknown Speaker  58:30
All right, take care.

Matthias Miller  58:35
All right. So the sheets, EPO calcs,

Speaker 1  58:41
the only, the only thing, the only thing I want to pick with is, is it? Maybe we just need to show it there of putting the CRA back in again. So, so right before the right before balance for EPO, minus, like I

Matthias Miller  58:58
Okay, minus unpaid rental fees, and then add back in the Yes, equal, sure, hey, I'm

Speaker 1  59:10
but we're adding it again later, and that's what's confusing To me.

Matthias Miller  59:19
Okay, let me see if I can

Matthias Miller  59:26
let me see if I can make this. I don't

Speaker 1  59:27
quite understand why we add, okay, riddle me this. I don't quite understand why we're saying we want to add the you want the tax in there is what you're saying

Matthias Miller  59:38
we need the I don't remember the details, I'll be honest, but basically

Unknown Speaker  59:43
the 11,000 I'm looking at this, hold on a second. I.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:13
Oh, silly me. What am I doing here? I

Unknown Speaker  1:01:02
answer so confused now i

Matthias Miller  1:01:42
You do? You have a contract? Do you still have that screenshot from RTO Pro?

Unknown Speaker  1:01:53
I can get one

Matthias Miller  1:01:54
where we could plug in our own numbers and verify, and verify.

Speaker 1  1:02:06
Yeah, let me just, let me get I'll just go to, I have RTO pro open, so I'll just,

Matthias Miller  1:02:14
but keep in mind that I don't think RTO Pro was doing, or I don't know what they were doing on the taxable portion.

Speaker 1  1:02:31
Me Look at that. You want some you want one with a CRA though, don't you?

Matthias Miller  1:02:38
Ideally? Yes, I do.

Speaker 1  1:02:42
Okay, so I have, where did I put this? Where did I put this,

Unknown Speaker  1:02:53
custom SQL strings?

Unknown Speaker  1:03:57
There you go.

Matthias Miller  1:04:08
Is this tax or pre tax, or

Speaker 1  1:04:18
pretty sure it's going to be, it's going to be pre tax, up to the point where he adds in 6.75 tax.

Matthias Miller  1:04:28
But see, this is like,

Matthias Miller  1:04:36
Okay, well, let's try this pass through rent.

Matthias Miller  1:04:44
Is zero. CRA amount, 3806, 80,

Matthias Miller  1:04:57
cash price percentage is six. 60 contract fee balance total, EPO subtotal. We don't have any fees on it. Of the

Matthias Miller  1:05:29
contract total would be 6363, 72 Rent page is 282, 832,

Matthias Miller  1:05:49
uh, let's do this.

Matthias Miller  1:06:35
Um, I have another meeting. I need to drop off. We're okay, can we I don't know how to make this work. Do you want to see about getting our heads together tomorrow? Or do you want to run the numbers? Or,

Unknown Speaker  1:06:58
Oh, you dropped the whole expression to me. I mean,

Matthias Miller  1:07:00
it's in there just to save it. Gotcha, I'm just going to try to swap out variables with hard coded values to

Speaker 1  1:07:08
match. And then it should, it should run the the result at the bottom right,

Matthias Miller  1:07:12
it'll show the grand total at the I mean, you can here. Let's do this. It will take out the side parameter. There you go.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:25
Yes, okay, I'll play with this

Matthias Miller  1:07:29
awesome thanks.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:34
You need me to drop off, okay, okay, maybe I.
