Unknown Speaker  00:26
What'd you think of my little fun piece?

Unknown Speaker  00:28
Look at you, dude,

Unknown Speaker  00:31
when I figured out that, wait a minute, you can convert a report into a chart,

Speaker 1  00:40
and I was like, wait. And then I went and had fun and and I really, I really want to, I really want to ask you to go build just a report for something so that I can, so I can do this. But I feel kind of bad taking a paint well, you know what? You can bill me for this on the but we're gonna go build this on inside side. That's fine. Let's do it that way. Because I want this thing. I wanted this. I want, I want a this sales versus last year's sales

Speaker 2  01:13
report. Can we do that? Have to be Expo, of course. We can. I have, of course, we

Matthias Miller  01:21
can a few things, yeah, between now and then.

Unknown Speaker  01:24
No, really,

Matthias Miller  01:27
so Ginger's is that Ginger's daughter, Summer, yeah, or some other

Speaker 1  01:35
she, she, she got an ultimatum at the beginning of September. She has to hit, she has to hit set numbers for September and October. Otherwise, just like you're gone,

Matthias Miller  01:46
summer has to Oh, her, Oh, I get it. I flipped the goal. Yeah, I don't think it's

Speaker 1  01:55
working. No, it's not William. On the other hand, dude, that guy's killing it. That's awesome. I don't like I'm not sure what happened with ginger this year. I think there's a lot of competition. I think it's partially competition. I think it's partially head head issues. But she is way off the goal.

Matthias Miller  02:24
I mean, yeah, I remember her, but

Unknown Speaker  02:29
oh man, last

Speaker 1  02:31
year she did almost 1.5 she's going to be lucky if she does a million this year. And some of it's just that, well, the anyway, so it's, this is conversation for another day,

Matthias Miller  02:51
another day someone else is done. All right, nice work, man.

Speaker 1  02:58
Well, I mean once, okay, once I saw how you did the, once I saw how you did the the mix chart for revenue, and I realized, wait a minute, this is a regular report. And then, like, wait, you can just take a regular report and you can, can, you can say it's a type of a chart, and then you just go hit your series. And it was just like, Wait, this was too easy.

Matthias Miller  03:29
This is how it should always have been. I mean, yeah, because there is no engine. I mean, the reporting engine is really, really powerful, really,

Speaker 1  03:42
really, really, really, really powerful. And someday I need to the whole models thing is where I feel like I fall apart and I really, I really want to. I want to, like, I can go build, I can go build this stuff and group stuff together and give me the numbers I want. But it's like, whenever I go, for some reason, whenever I try to go, put it in a model, it just my head just wants to break and it just anyway,

Matthias Miller  04:10
I'll give you the one sentence, and we'll keep rolling the one sentence is a model is like a mini report.

Speaker 1  04:16
I know that I get that, but it's like, for some reason,

Matthias Miller  04:20
because you can't, because you can't see it.

Speaker 1  04:22
Maybe, maybe that's what it is. I don't know. Let's go. Do we're working on past duet dashboard today?

Matthias Miller  04:27
Yes, past due dashboard isn't the last thing on the list. I think so.

Speaker 1  04:34
Okay, actually, just for kicks and giggles, pull up contract report. Wait, you said, you told me that in order to, in order to do what you showed me yesterday, that that support needs to be added to the platform that's not native to the platform where you can add columns, take columns away, that kind

Matthias Miller  04:56
of, I mean, it has to be added on the back end. Well, you got, okay, yeah. Mean, you have to configure the report to allow

Speaker 1  05:01
it. So then there's one last thing. Well, first off, I just want to go, let's, let's just browse the numbers one last time. And then I think we're going to do is we're going to add an expanded checkbox, and then we're going to, we're going to assign some of these columns to that, that expanded checkbox, and just kind of shrink some of this down 15 cents. Okay, so that was the I wanted to see the difference between on Theresa hinko to make sure the contract balance and the rental contract balance. Our contract rental balance, those two agree. Because, Yep, perfect.

Matthias Miller  05:31
Okay, we could find one where they don't like this guy,

Speaker 1  05:39
and you should be able to tool tip him and and see right,

Matthias Miller  05:48
unpaid late fee balance you have a negative late fee balance.

Speaker 1  05:52
Oh, that was, that was the other thing I came across that I'm glad, I'm glad you found that I

Speaker 1  06:04
would that mean? Would that mean we paid more late fees than we incurred?

Unknown Speaker  06:07
What's I'm trying to figure out, unpaid fees i

Matthias Miller  06:24
Oh, somebody for we forgave.

Unknown Speaker  06:32
We forgave more than than they had.

Matthias Miller  06:33
Yeah, we did, all right, huh?

Unknown Speaker  06:38
Which one do you want to delete?

Speaker 1  06:41
Well, I don't care. Just, just, let's just, let's go find there's a couple of these. I think let's just fix them.

Unknown Speaker  06:52
There you go.

Speaker 1  06:54
All right, can we? Can you? Can you write something to find that any contract that has negative late fee balances, because there is a couple, I

Unknown Speaker  07:14
would say It might be a little bit more than a couple.

Speaker 1  07:27
How many? How many did you have? 92

Matthias Miller  07:35
I think what's happening is somewhere we threw forgiveness and I we should probably do is go find all of for all periods Where there's a forgiveness, keep The forgiveness and delete the I'm that

Unknown Speaker  09:49
this poor guy crane, so we should get about 90.

Matthias Miller  10:14
Actually do more than that. It would be more like, yeah, it's going to be because some of these have doubles, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  10:31
All right, 151 Okay, so then let's do I

Unknown Speaker  11:55
wonderful people, and we can probably speed this up by saying, I

Unknown Speaker  12:15
You can do it, buddy, I believe in you.

Matthias Miller  12:35
Oh, well, let's do it The fast way. Why not? I'm

Matthias Miller  13:12
okay, so there's going to be some that don't have.

Speaker 2  13:18
Yeah, some of them actually, does you where it all balances out, but there's some other fee somewhere that they can get paid. So that's a more accurate list. Anyway, it's way faster. I

Unknown Speaker  13:44
All right, so we are deleting, so now if we go back to forgiven, it was incurred and forgiven. This guy deleting four different ones.

Matthias Miller  13:59
Forgiven. All right,

Speaker 1  14:35
wait. Why do we have a why do we have an EPO savings on a contract that's not EPO ed?

Unknown Speaker  14:50
I think, 17, 727, And I think there were some changes that I never pushed live.

Unknown Speaker  15:17
They say, I don't remember it said, 727, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  15:33
well, we can keep we can i

Unknown Speaker  15:46
I'm always paranoid of updating somebody else's system.

Matthias Miller  15:54
Navigate, clean that. What else you want to take a look at until it updates out from under us.

Unknown Speaker  16:02
So takes care of all those negative fees. Okay, perfect.

Speaker 1  16:08
Now that's, that's good because that's what I what I don't want to find myself. What I'm trying to avoid is putting my putting, putting your mouse on a tooltip, and going, well, somebody going, Why is there a savings from an EPO of nine cents? What's going on? I don't know.

Matthias Miller  16:30
Yeah, the nine cent one will go away after the update, should we can double check? Okay.

Speaker 1  16:37
Then, well, this is, this is really our last day to make sure we polish everything off. So the only, the only either, either we, either we make a stab at the past due dashboard, or we say it's not worth the time. And I could honestly go either way. Well.

Matthias Miller  16:58
I mean, is there anything else I Is there somebody like Leanne who would be able to take a more careful pass through the numbers? Or no, it

Unknown Speaker  17:14
would have to be, it would have to be this afternoon. So I

Matthias Miller  17:18
think there's, I think there's, I think there would be value in that. I might have some time this afternoon. I will. I'm also like, anyway, I need all of tomorrow for there. I should take all tomorrow through my own build out stuff, because I get a bunch of stuff I gotta build out as well.

Matthias Miller  17:54
So I don't mind building the pass through dashboard, if it's I could go either way and didn't really don't care. I don't mind building to that pass through dashboard if you don't need but we could also just take an afternoon time slot

Unknown Speaker  18:27
and work on other things now, or I could you just still work on other things

Unknown Speaker  18:38
And then do a review the numbers this afternoon, yeah,

Matthias Miller  18:49
review and rebuild the dashboard if we have time,

Unknown Speaker  18:56
what? Let's see. I what time this afternoon would you want to do this?

Unknown Speaker  19:03
I would be free from three to 430 year time.

Speaker 1  19:06
That would be perfect. All right, well, then let's go do other things, and let's, let's plan on three to 430 I will message Leanne and see if we can lock her in for a period. And, I mean, we, we should be able to do this in, like, for I know that she's got a bunch of tight things this afternoon, so I know that she, if we can keep it to, like, 30 minutes, it probably works about best. But I don't think you need much more than that to really just kind of calculate through a few contracts to make sure that we're on on target.

Matthias Miller  19:42
I mean, I mean, if you guys, if you guys are comfortable, if she's comfortable, from what she saw last night, I'm fine with that as well.

Speaker 1  19:49
And yeah, no, I think it's, I think it's valuable to go back one more time through it and just sample a few accounts out of the of there. And. Just be like, Okay, let's look. Let's just, let's run through the math on this stuff. Is that fair?

Unknown Speaker  20:13
If you, if you answered, I didn't hear you, uh,

Matthias Miller  20:18
that's fair. Can you hear me now? Yes, okay, yep, sounds good.

Speaker 1  20:25
All right, I'm gonna message your so we're playing for three. Oh, I already see you. Sent me a thing, perfect.

Unknown Speaker  20:37
All right, I'll see you at three.
