Unknown Speaker  00:51
Yes

Unknown Speaker  01:00
right

Speaker 1  01:13
all right I got to have as much time as I would have liked to get all my ducks in a row good we'll have a little bit more more time if we need to run late run run a little longer

Unknown Speaker  01:38
for some of the total revenue

Speaker 1  02:06
Okay, I will pass this along to make sure all that's updating over to Joel we did fill him in this morning Ellison filament this morning about prioritizing this over cash flows. So that was on his radar

Unknown Speaker  02:30
I think you sent it Joel as well.

Unknown Speaker  02:32
Yeah. But yeah, and then it was awesome. I will. Alright, yes, it's now

Unknown Speaker  02:41
I'm assuming you guys know where to find that document

Unknown Speaker  02:47
Yes, yes.

Speaker 2  02:52
Yeah. Like I don't but I'm assuming you do.

Unknown Speaker  02:57
It's gonna be from an internal system here. So

Speaker 3  03:00
yeah, yep. And like Drew mentioned is we're just requesting the bare basics that we need for right now. We're going to be adding a bunch of columns or adding some things later but like previous year comparison we don't have 24 we'll only have one year so maybe your comparison is no yeah

Unknown Speaker  03:32
I thought we had a we didn't that was the balance sheet where we had the Oh yeah.

Unknown Speaker  03:43
But not all the income statement. Got it. Okay

Speaker 2  03:54
you know you have in there on the income statements you have like to show or to group as moms or show all the months ago you can show each month in separate column. My thought would be like, like the year to date column would just be a similar selection as well. You'd click the Show year to date checkbox or something like that.

Unknown Speaker  04:20
Should we take a look at that briefly or

Unknown Speaker  04:23
is it not? Yeah, it might be worth it

Unknown Speaker  04:34
Okay, let's do this

Unknown Speaker  04:55
betters students Share this thing

Unknown Speaker  05:32
you need the year to date comparison for December 31 You're saying oh you mean half the month is December well I mean do we do we need do we need the year to the additional year to date column

Speaker 1  05:59
on the report that you'd like to see would you be doing a one month versus year to date

Unknown Speaker  06:12
right it'll be both you'll be showing both columns

Speaker 1  06:21
but you'll be using this as soon as you go live it's not the kind of thing that will wait until we get a whole year under our belt before we need to comparison

Speaker 2  06:31
you know so in February we will see here today as well as February

Unknown Speaker  06:52
they think that's all pretty straightforward now the yes yes.

Speaker 2  07:05
I think that section just below where you highlighted there the add the following subtypes I think that is something that's all that's all old information was taken care of, I believe but I'm not sure

Unknown Speaker  07:19
if some of these might be

Speaker 1  07:33
boom, so config I think some of these are in in assist, but not in the standard product. And I think we might want them in the standard product

Speaker 1  07:58
types that's So functionally it's yeah, I'm not sure if there's anything you need to do consciously for that or not, but

Speaker 2  08:19
on the number code, I think whichever way it works for for you all is fine. Like we have the account numbers set up so that you could take the first two numbers those are essentially as a a sub account I mean, it's subtype known so are that works best?

Unknown Speaker  09:00
I'm saying to put them in the correct section

Speaker 2  09:15
on that you can't it won't Well, yeah, it shouldn't be able to go by just in order of value. In other words, the 40s are first and the 50s are second and the 60s are third and so on there and should be able to go by numerical value

Speaker 1  09:47
Yeah, and because you're but you're also because they're all the same number of digits. Yes, that also eliminates issue so well know

Speaker 2  10:10
if you go by these numbers like all those 60 sixes are one subtype and the 60 fours have above them are different subtypes

Speaker 1  10:20
Yeah, but we've got a sorting issue here 6632 131 is coming before 66 up to 31 because it's sorting these alphabetically not numerically

Speaker 2  10:39
but there are some that we did move as well I think to place them in a different position.

Unknown Speaker  10:46
So this might have been this might be an intentional order.

Speaker 2  10:50
Yeah, and I don't know that we necessarily went through everything and specifically tried to reorder there were a few I forget where they were that we did move

Speaker 3  11:00
I think on the balance sheet somewhere that but yeah, my balance sheet we didn't spend we know there are some we want to move I believe but we didn't spend a lot of time moving them yet.

Speaker 1  11:12
Got it. I mean, that's fine as long as I mean as long as there's no expectation from you guys. If you want these if you would want these sort of numerically then we've probably just asked you to have leading leading zeros point three one or 0.031 but if you guys are happy with this it's yeah that's good

Unknown Speaker  11:37
yeah, this boy

Unknown Speaker  11:39
yeah

Speaker 1  11:41
you got bigger fish to fry right now so then we're gonna need it at these expense the expense take fuel for differentiate between Cost of Goods Sold operating expense and non operating expense and ship those that we can break

Unknown Speaker  12:11
and then or how to count numbers

Speaker 1  12:49
and then there's one other thing that you were mentioning Agnes that's not regarding very beginning when we started talking this through checkbox we're setting we're

Unknown Speaker  13:19
the let's go through this and

Unknown Speaker  13:34
see, do we talk through turtles?

Speaker 2  13:41
totals will be firm subtype per type and subtype?

Speaker 3  13:46
Yep. You send that that that that picture from that example as well, right.

Unknown Speaker  13:53
It hasn't come through yet.

Speaker 2  14:05
That picture doesn't have this doesn't have those subtypes. It only has typed tones. I see. And I think well, one subtype toes because we don't have that many subtypes. Like

Unknown Speaker  14:22
yeah, I agree. Would it be worth me I believe

Unknown Speaker  14:31
you could just do it that way.

Unknown Speaker  14:37
But you're not looking for totals on parents accounts or you're

Speaker 2  14:41
not? Because I think what we'll want to do there is based like, show that based upon the level of account it's in, you know, because if we're looking at five levels we don't want All those totals, because they're we're looking for L cow amounts not total.

Speaker 1  15:07
And you can get some of that just by doing shrinking the levels in the report. Right, right. get exactly what you need there.

Speaker 2  15:17
Yeah. Like that's kind of something to get off in the weeds about the other columns or things to get off in the weeds about like, different percentage type of columns based upon something other than total revenue and, you know, just good stuff, but stuff that we don't necessarily need to worry about now. Yep.

Unknown Speaker  15:43
Okay. All right. Well, I think that okay,

Speaker 3  15:47
oh, I just sent you that sample income statement I think it'd be worth just actually let me send you the balance sheet as well.

Unknown Speaker  16:39
The

Unknown Speaker  16:45
best

Unknown Speaker  16:53
this

Unknown Speaker  17:04
end, we could just take a quick look at the

Unknown Speaker  17:13
income statement the spine.

Speaker 3  17:36
So, I think that, you know something like that as far as the layout, how the subtypes are they're broken apart? Like you've got assets, current assets to toes, the lines there. I think that makes a very readable format. Now, I don't know what you're playing us for the negative or the Contra numbers like the accumulated depreciation? Personally, I don't. What do we have? No, I don't really care for the I think the parentheses you have a negative. Right? Yeah. That's, to me. That's by far the easiest. Yeah, read so and then the income statement is about the same thing. But let's just take a quick look at it.

Speaker 2  18:23
Like the balance sheet shows the sub types and their and their totals. But this income statement doesn't.

Unknown Speaker  18:34
All right. Oh, yeah.

Speaker 3  18:41
What was basically what Joe Joe has faked out would be just like this, but down in the sales general and administrating instead of only one we would have the way we have our we would have sales, marketing, and admin. Is that right? Yeah.

Speaker 2  19:00
And they'd be in separate, like each would be its own group.

Speaker 3  19:07
And so you see anything that's difficult or any problems with what were the requests we have?

Speaker 1  19:22
Well, if we can use, I like this kind of nesting, nesting on some of the balance, the grouping, it's in the balance sheet.

Unknown Speaker  19:32
And just applying that to the income statement, as well. I think that makes a lot of sense to me. Yeah, I don't know offhand. What we're going to run into but just

Speaker 3  19:46
what that means that the income statement would also be grouped by or total by subtypes instead of just types.

Unknown Speaker  19:57
That's the way the balance sheet is there.

Speaker 3  20:00
All the way to get away from that or if you wouldn't want to see that then you just go back out one day, right?

Speaker 2  20:06
Well you're out and you're sometimes they're always gonna be I was gonna be there. That's not That's not showing totals for for the child parent situation

Speaker 3  20:21
so if we do do like the balance sheet what would we be showing on the income statement differently?

Unknown Speaker  20:29
Just those totals

Unknown Speaker  20:37
below

Speaker 2  20:38
below each subtype section so there'll be subtype title and then it was like this balance sheet we're not

Unknown Speaker  20:48
right now it makes I mean that makes sense.

Unknown Speaker  20:56
Well, they're not showing on there so

Speaker 1  20:59
it would be it would be revenue instead of assets it would be you know, I don't know what are you what your what the rates and types are? You know, some type one total subtype one. Yeah. Expenses as you know, sales sales yep, yep. But it gives us more than a good would

Speaker 2  21:28
basically just be there'll be a total for this section total for this section total for this section. Okay, instead of one total for the whole guy.

Unknown Speaker  21:36
Right?

Unknown Speaker  21:39
Good. We will just read it'd be more

Speaker 2  21:48
totals than it'd be a few more totals but we're not trying to throw in totals for every child situation

Speaker 1  21:59
and if we get to the end of this and you're like well there are times we don't want to see subtypes or something totals or I don't know I mean it's the there's plenty of options and as far as customizing tweaking this down the road so good I will I spoke with Mark insolence do change request

Speaker 3  22:39
and if I don't know Matthias is it you is it ellos but if if you could just let us know what you know with these changes what the eta is what we can expect to so you can kinda know what to expect and plan for Yeah.

Speaker 1  23:34
Okay, good that's a good spirit that and save those off my plate grabbed the agenda and

Unknown Speaker  24:12
let me open the agenda. Okay. Deep payment accounts. All right, let me look at this and see where what's left. So, Jack is no longer an active payment account. Is that and instead it seems like it should be either, or it seems like it should be the primary trade checking. Okay, so

Unknown Speaker  24:52
Oh, yeah. There.

Unknown Speaker  24:56
We can see that. I don't know if I can

Unknown Speaker  25:03
Let me see if I can get him here

Unknown Speaker  25:12
it's easy once you know where to play

Speaker 2  25:14
I was trying to click over to the right there.

Unknown Speaker  25:18
Oh got it. So when this

Speaker 2  25:28
maybe I should have a better way to do this, which those all should still end up in there in that account like that account that payment account is correct.

Speaker 1  25:38
Right, but let me let me Alright, well we're not going to do the manual way we're gonna find a faster way to do this next time but so then if I've been select this and hit Update Selected Records, right, it's good. Push that account across now. So after the update that should have auto filled because we don't have the update we have to manually hit that big copy that across so we hit save and there goes go let's do let's add a let's add a

Unknown Speaker  26:36
invoice payment equals

Unknown Speaker  27:07
the show should alright let's try this so this will then actually let's let's do one other thing let's make this thing

Speaker 1  27:32
all right then that was thing cranked before then

Speaker 3  27:41
how many hours how many hours does it take to become this proficient and

Unknown Speaker  27:49
I don't know if I wanted to know

Speaker 3  27:55
less than one lifetime but probably a good portion of it

Speaker 1  28:03
so the old payment type is check new payment type would be the primary checking ABC right yeah well and are all of these for sure. Are there any

Unknown Speaker  28:17
there were other companies in the they need to

Unknown Speaker  28:21
Yeah, we need to put a district Coulter in here for an accounting company

Unknown Speaker  28:54
all right

Unknown Speaker  29:02
Alright, so for the ABC, Jack, ABC primary primary Check, check primary checking etc Now let's review the changes and see what Okay, so some some of them failed. These last changed oops we should not see oh, I didn't want to do that. I missed I missed the condition here.

Speaker 1  30:32
Let's see this hey if you can update we'll get to those make sure that it didn't touch anything so ship time is fine awesome any other dream let's save that

Unknown Speaker  31:12
well that's not good I'm

Unknown Speaker  31:20
gonna get again you're gonna help me get the same thing ignore existing errors there you go gonna make more problems than there were before we're good

Unknown Speaker  31:37
well they can't do worse than being the wrong account so

Speaker 1  31:44
we're gonna do this again

Speaker 1  32:12
it doesn't even let me do it at all okay so here's here's the other thing we're going to do then you can only do this for selected record records and then we're just going to do them in batches

Unknown Speaker  32:37
degrees in primary secondary BC

Unknown Speaker  32:46
like those

Unknown Speaker  33:06
primary checking see somehow it's it's trying to modify other records it's good to be modifying and it's not so then what's the okay so credit card then maybe see credit card

Unknown Speaker  33:33
was his primary CC

Unknown Speaker  33:45
hey

Unknown Speaker  33:58
what does it not like about okay Why does this have an ACH source account

Unknown Speaker  34:17
is a credit card payment not an ACH payment

Speaker 1  34:39
I don't know if it really matters anymore. Where was let's see, let's let's clean up some of these checking ones yet. This would be shed well some of these are the wrong

Speaker 2  34:59
yeah I'm totally wrong company and but the accounting company listed to the right is correct.

Unknown Speaker  35:07
Got it? So we need to separate between st and STM.

Unknown Speaker  35:11
Right. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  35:14
We'll sort by that and it'll be good. Okay, so here's STM Oops 94 I guess it wouldn't matter what is stop itself sta

Speaker 2  35:32
yeah we want you don't have that one yes key is the account

Unknown Speaker  35:41
you want it in st Yeah

Unknown Speaker  35:49
or the company I guess it is that'd be st no payment would have to check new

Unknown Speaker  36:01
primary checking but yeah like that

Unknown Speaker  36:06
yeah

Speaker 1  36:13
use payment types would be best here again really bird going to f2 enterprise PC

Unknown Speaker  36:40
in battle structures check in gently bring a lot be a surprise

Unknown Speaker  36:57
metal structures are

Speaker 2  37:12
that would be my understanding. Yeah. I mean, I kind of think that I had set them inactive before once, but I don't have good proof of that. So

Speaker 1  37:29
some of these are this is actually this is not the filtered list that's that's the way some of those are showing up in there

Unknown Speaker  37:40
so just the SP primary check checking. Alright, that should clear out a whole bunch and then we should be down to a bunch of missile miscellaneous

Speaker 2  37:53
so like those were already in the right payment account I mean, that's what it was. But well, do we that's fair. Do we even need to be changing well, so yeah, like that one right there I mean, that is the right payment account but is there something in the logic that if the

Speaker 1  38:19
if the payment type is inactive so we should ignore inactive we don't care about inactive No, okay, so

Speaker 2  38:31
they need to be changed. We need to have them in our report here. Because part of the reason the reason they are in the wrong place is because in a payment type with us that is now inactive

Unknown Speaker  38:50
Okay, here's here's one of them. Let's go to accounting companies. Let's let's drill into this. It

Speaker 1  39:02
seems to me like a safe source of accounting. Seems like this should be central. Oh H or ACH, ABC.

Unknown Speaker  39:10
Yeah. Okay.

Speaker 1  39:15
And you had and see was had one

Speaker 1  39:25
and then and then here the reason it's complaining here, which I don't know that we really care is it has an H ACH source account specified when it's not necessary.

Unknown Speaker  39:42
It would seem to know and then QuickBooks ACH doesn't need one. This one has the right payment. These will Okay, fine. So doesn't have one. So let's the only reason we should or.

Unknown Speaker  40:22
Alright, let's try this

Speaker 1  40:33
what does it not like? Okay, here are a bunch of ACH payments. It thinks, does it matter? Well, let's have any validation errors. Do we even care about the ACH source account in this case?

Speaker 2  40:53
Um, no, not at this point anyway, maybe down the road and well, but not now.

Unknown Speaker  41:00
Alright, let's ignore that, then. Let's also also,

Speaker 2  41:10
I mean, really, all we need is that the payments that were made in a certain account are showing up in that correct. Accounts reconcile.

Unknown Speaker  41:26
Okay, so

Speaker 1  41:32
expense checking, is that supposed to be meant to expense checking in certain

Speaker 2  41:41
expense checking is a is a checking account that they use debit cards out of. But I don't think we're actually making payments out of there when we write checks or ACH is are we like, it's the replacement for a credit card? I think. Yeah.

Speaker 1  42:00
So did these get paid out of the expense checking? Or did they get paid out of primary checking?

Unknown Speaker  42:06
I don't know. We don't know.

Unknown Speaker  42:09
But either either Well, okay. And then if we go back over to here?

Speaker 1  42:21
Oh, no, that's the issue. That's how it went. Since the issue with these is that it thinks it should be going into the expense checking checking account. But it's not the primary checking right now. Do we want to do we want to push it across into the into the expense checking in?

Speaker 2  42:43
I mean, if they selected that, then that should be going to that expense checking accounts. That Oh, three, four account.

Speaker 1  42:56
So that's that. Primary cat one. Yeah, this one's these are just wrong. The credit card stinks like this. Apparently.

Speaker 2  43:08
You shouldn't even be able to enter anything into that. Yep. Which is stuff that was assigned before we changed up accounts. And

Unknown Speaker  43:22
let's take a look at dates.

Speaker 1  43:34
Well, here's something we could do. We could

Speaker 1  43:48
Oh, yeah, I don't know how much I don't know how much of this you need to get cleaned up. Sorry, I'm kind of taking the take the wheel here and actually cleaning some of this stuff. But let's take a look. So really, what we need to do is go down through however far back you're wanting to go. Like this one, again, this one looks like it's just wrong. It's marking secondary checking. It looks like it should be going to mean that not the expense checking. Right. Right. Account credit. Well, how far back are you really wanting to go?

Unknown Speaker  44:26
Well, is there any point in going back further than say September 1?

Speaker 2  44:29
No, no, no timer first is as far back as we went even need to go. But even that, I don't know that we would have to go to September 1 on

Unknown Speaker  44:39
all the companies.

Speaker 2  44:42
You know, like we go to September 1 and in formal barns.

Speaker 3  44:52
What I'm thinking is, it would allow us to try reconciling. If we went to September 1, try reconciling for the month of December. Hammer for each of the various accounts, I don't think we would have to reconcile the whole thing but it

Speaker 1  45:16
Okay, so then that shortens the list about 90 that you still need to clean up or potentially need to clean up sort of by payment accounts

Unknown Speaker  45:32
those are inactive, that doesn't matter. Let's make the payment account be editable. So you can change that in there.

Unknown Speaker  45:46
So we really do payment site to the right.

Speaker 1  45:57
These need to be cleaned up this one I don't know, it looks like there's still some cleanup. Did you want to go through the cleanup of the rest of these items? Did you want me to help you go through the cleanup the rest of these items and take a look? Did you want to take a look at him?

Speaker 2  46:15
I can probably just take a look at them. I mean, they're in the other companies. You know. So I don't know that. Like, as long as we clean up just ABC, we should be fine. To be able to reconcile something.

Speaker 1  46:32
Okay, well, let's let's, let's finish. So these were credit cards. Right? And then. So this one's fine. It's all in primary checking. Okay. So if we just if we just say those three ABCs. Good. Yeah. And good. And then dampener can also send another round of reconciliations. So, I mean, I think we can just wait for that to push across Monday or whenever you get a chance, unless you want to take a look at that before Monday.

Unknown Speaker  47:14
Well, we're not going to get to other stuff.

Speaker 3  47:20
So but what are the changes we just made will push across Monday?

Speaker 1  47:30
Well, we need to reconcile to push the AP transactions into accounting. Oh, if we want to

Speaker 3  47:49
the changes we made now are just changing the payment types. We have to wait until that those transactions push into accounting with those changes.

Unknown Speaker  48:00
Yeah.

Speaker 2  48:01
That's why when I change, some of them seem to make a difference.

Speaker 3  48:06
Now why does this does this change happen every night? Like is this one when it when it counted?

Speaker 1  48:18
Yeah, right before midnight. And I can kick it off right now if you will, if you want it doesn't preside?

Unknown Speaker  48:24
No, I don't worry about

Speaker 3  48:27
your cruise. Right, we do that we won't get to the other stuff. So

Speaker 2  48:35
we're also working on a waning battery on my computer. So we're good. We'll be good till we run out of time. I think so I think

Speaker 3  48:46
four or five teams. Right off, it's mainly just an update on where you're at what remains to be done. I think I listed what I what my memory told me that we had. Okay, the first one is just do and I talked about it as well be able to do write offs per payment. Good there account mapping, and creating and modifying right off. So just give us a quick, when is this going to be live? And then also Is it far enough along that you can show drew where to create modify the write offs?

Speaker 1  49:27
Well, well please don't record any write offs because I'm going to go move it to be on a per payment basis. But there are two places if you go into receive payments, you would see we got a check for 100 and and there are yeah and then we click the these are not editable. Like Can't you edit and write up? I'm sure there's a specific reason

Unknown Speaker  50:00
I wonder if I should give a warning instead?

Speaker 1  50:09
State. So do let me see it again. So, I will change that, but you should be able to

Unknown Speaker  50:25
do it right there.

Speaker 1  50:27
Do it right there, it would default, the right update the right up amount, you would fill in the right reason. And you could apply it or you should be able to go into here. It has right up and put it in right there.

Speaker 2  50:41
Yeah, so now, where are these? Right off types? And the account mapping, then we go with it. That doesn't exist yet.

Unknown Speaker  50:52
doesn't exist yet. It will. Oh, well, existing.

Speaker 3  50:59
Are you thinking Monday new week like the sixth lecture? What the next? Yes. That?

Speaker 1  51:08
Yeah, I might. I might see how energetic I feel before then. But most likely, that's going to be shared.

Speaker 3  51:17
Okay. And that would be all three points here. Right off? By like the sixth or? Yeah. Okay. Good. I don't think there's anything else on that really is. I think Drew, you're not going to be using it day in and day out. But you're going to, you're going to need to know how it works. But it's probably it's primarily Dwayne's team that's going right. You can coordinate with them a training

Speaker 2  51:45
as long as I get to get the accounts mapped correctly to Oh, yeah, that's that's what lands squarely in my field.

Speaker 3  51:57
The last question there What permission, permission levels are required to access I'm sure permissions are probably not the top thing we're tracking right now. That's probably, but this is not critical. At some point, I know that we'll have to go through and look at automations. But ignore that for now. Let's talk about three. Reviewing design for pay paying vendors. So it seems like the best place to start is by bringing up the AP verification report showing all invoices with status of unpaid, unverified, this is on the IMS side, but this which is what Whitney is currently using. Expect You may need to backdate this report because managers approve invoices to be paid Monday or Tuesday and then when you pay some later in the week. If so, could you back get a report to show us what ABC would have looked like, say on Tuesday? Or do you have the could we go get a report like that and basically say

Unknown Speaker  53:03
start from there

Speaker 1  53:12
I don't know that we can easily go backwards.

Speaker 3  53:15
Well, if not, we can even just go to it to a report like that.

Unknown Speaker  53:22
Remember which. Okay. This is one of them. Based on unpaid,

Speaker 3  53:36
unpaid, unpaid. Unpaid, unpaid approve because Whitney that marks them currently he marks them paid ones. Okay, so this is where we show the status? I thought there's no right here. Oh, unpaid approved. Okay. So what this is saying is we have an invoice here. I mean, usually there's a whole list of them. But we have this list, you have P Salsbury, for total of 7327. Yeah, 58 with a discount, the discount expiration date, the due date, the status? And then if you once approved, what happened all that that the checkmark, the brackets are just for the Yeah, for check. Yeah. So basically, once it gets to this point from, from what we need you to do Drew, and what we want to build is once it gets to this point, it's just pay them the most efficient way possible. So some thoughts that we had were here in CIF while the idea of paying vendors efficiently is a great option to filter by payment type so Once a week you would come in here, we're not showing payment type currently, but you'd filter by payment type. And say show me all the ACH is and you do a quick glance and say select all and pay and then you do all the checks from either select all or select Specified invoices. And then the third point show available funds remaining for the account type just like payment types. This list there was a big typo this should this would avoid embarrassing situations instead of allow embarrassing

Unknown Speaker  55:43
No, yes.

Unknown Speaker  55:44
There's Drew. Is there more to add to that? I mean,

Speaker 2  55:48
um, if you can sort the list by date by due date, that would be helpful too in a cash flow shortage situation. Yeah, so we don't ever anticipate that to happen but wait, you

Speaker 1  56:06
guys don't run a real business or here you don't have humans working in it? Yeah. Date enter discount expiration date invoice due date.

Speaker 3  56:26
Now, there was a diagnostic report built based off of this activity. I think did dash built this. It was very similar to your diagnostic reports and I don't know is it mean how does that I think that's also was doing the same thing basically saying when we go to pay these here's here's the impact it has on accounting whether it goes to receive not voucher or that okay, that has to do with when it's received, I think it might be worth spending two minutes looking at that report is you remember what it's called? Yeah. Accounts Payable I think it's something

Unknown Speaker  57:15
I'm not sure if it's on the menu or not but I find it here

Unknown Speaker  57:29
the I think it's the sky and so here we would be looking for to a number this one is the sky so here this one would be debit debit of 7327 or B, A P of credit of 7327 58.

Unknown Speaker  57:58
And then it would also impact production supplies there's

Unknown Speaker  58:06
that might be coming off the PIO

Speaker 3  58:11
what we had seen was it was was it in a diagnostic mode report where it was

Unknown Speaker  58:17
grouped all the transactions that happened for that particular invoice together

Unknown Speaker  58:24
yeah we're sales

Speaker 2  58:36
that was it was called Hopper something there was sales or factions

Speaker 1  58:48
right but that's that's on the air if it's sales order it's on it's on the AR side not AP

Unknown Speaker  58:58
not sales or purchase

Unknown Speaker  59:03
okay

Unknown Speaker  59:09
yeah, it was it was something

Unknown Speaker  59:25
I mean, I suspect it's

Unknown Speaker  59:34
it's this guy.

Unknown Speaker  59:39
Do accounting event debugging? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  59:42
that's what it is. Yeah, account events. Is that a standard report? I don't know. Can you share your screen and show him because you've got it on your shortcodes are drop drop the link in the chat

Unknown Speaker  1:00:21
Alright, so the PIO no problem do it

Unknown Speaker  1:00:32
Yep. Yeah.

Speaker 3  1:00:35
So it when we receive it, it impacts raw materials and receive not voucher, which means we think we know what it costs, we're not sure. And then when we actually attach the invoice to it a day later in this case, we it comes out of receiving that voucher and goes to accounts payable. And if those numbers were different, then it would also make that change to the raw materials. So when we pay I don't know, does paying? Yeah, paying would create another set of debits and credits.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:15
Which this one is not paid. But if we go

Speaker 3  1:01:18
into Yeah, I think it's showing those as well.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:25
Yeah, they're sitting in?

Unknown Speaker  1:01:29
Well, I'm happy

Unknown Speaker  1:01:31
with we looked at this very

Unknown Speaker  1:01:33
briefly, but

Unknown Speaker  1:01:38
it's pretty paid. Not letting me

Unknown Speaker  1:01:49
do it let's do this.

Speaker 3  1:01:50
Or something was, I don't know. Lanes

Unknown Speaker  1:01:53
team gets all

Speaker 3  1:01:55
in a tizzy every day they have to change something page report. So maybe this is why they can't access the variable or they say it's like going into a black hole to find those.

Unknown Speaker  1:02:07
We need to fix that.

Speaker 1  1:02:14
Well, part of the black hole is just how many paid invoices there are and how slow we are getting.

Unknown Speaker  1:02:25
I mean, it's actually their real problem. Hang on. We'll try to be careful not to say this thing over the trouble with my temporary changes.

Speaker 3  1:02:45
The ideal one would be Yeah, we had some that were pretty complex. So the ideal one would be the one that's paid obviously. And we're the received not vouchered was different than the accounts payable, but I don't know that we really don't have a way of seeing that. Year. So

Unknown Speaker  1:03:03
yeah,

Speaker 3  1:03:04
just take your pick. Just take one. Yeah, we had a delivery tied to it. So yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:17
Like a pregnant wife. Why does it not?

Speaker 3  1:03:22
Well, I think the vendor if you're okay, there was something new either for depending on what you wanted to see you had to enter the purchase order in the Okay, I think you had to enter the vendor invoice if you want to see the paid.

Speaker 2  1:03:35
Go to the report that is the PIO debugging one. I think that will always work better for me than the VI

Speaker 1  1:03:45
Yeah, but the VI is what you need to look at the vendor invoice impact. Oh,

Speaker 3  1:03:53
you need to pick a different number. Go back to that report for the VI under ABC supply 53852226 or that's the number you that's the vendor invoice number that you need to use. I believe

Speaker 1  1:04:07
it then the invoice. I'm not sure though. That's actually looking to be the administrator for one of these meetings and maybe, you know, it's this it's this short, system generated. system generated ID there we go. Here's one.

Speaker 3  1:04:31
Okay, yeah. So this one never. Ah, okay, so this one, we obviously had the, this one never went into received. Oh, because we

Speaker 2  1:04:42
did, but this is the vendor the vendor invoice never did because once it becomes a vendor invoice, then it's on its way out of receipt. I see. That's why this, this report doesn't show receipt.

Speaker 1  1:04:56
Yeah, but if I go into this, this Pio Isn't that right then? Well, should

Unknown Speaker  1:05:10
I take the wrong one I think

Unknown Speaker  1:05:19
let's do I don't know strike Yeah, we do on metal. So here's this one. So here it comes out of receiving that voucher and AP and then gets paid. And then the PIO.

Speaker 3  1:05:48
Let's take one more that. So. Which Which company? Are we looking here? Affordable? Yeah. Pick a USP Salsbury. Think it's you at USP salesman? Yeah, pick one of those. Because those typically have a freight invoice tied to them. Like, get up.

Speaker 1  1:06:15
All right, so grab the yo. Yo in there. Let's go grab the vendor invoice ID. I went in there. Now let's go look at the PIO or here's the PIO.

Speaker 3  1:06:30
Raw materials counts payable. I'm shaking. Okay. Okay, what were we seeing Accounts Payable again? Oh, God,

Speaker 2  1:06:43
somebody's not listening to debit first and the transaction that is that should be always standard, but

Unknown Speaker  1:06:54
got it makes sense. Raw material.

Speaker 3  1:07:00
All right. So there's just well, the bottom line, we have to make sure that the accounting impact on all of these is correct when we go to pay them. So this was may have been a distraction than anything else.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:12
That looks like that's worth

Speaker 1  1:07:15
doing, if you want to, we could we could create a multi pane report that could let you search for vendor invoices and drill down into and see this all on one screen. So you could see it all together. But I think that's helpful

Speaker 2  1:07:38
that, that, you know, if we're starting if the paying vendors and selecting those, if we're starting with that Accounts Payable verification report, there's a fair amount of information on there that we wouldn't really need to have any, you know, like the description we wouldn't need and what was received and you know, a lot of that stuff. I mean, that's all stuff that they're supposed to take care of before it ever comes to actually, you know, saying payments,

Speaker 3  1:08:10
is this something where you might want a, like Dwayne wanted the other day. So pain report. On your right. If you have questions on a specific invoice or purchase order, where you click on it you like you say the something looks odd. Let me go and drill into the details or is that yeah, yeah, probably,

Speaker 2  1:08:27
you know, like, like this arrangement. If there's 30 things, you have to scroll in order to see all right, you know, so less information where we're just simply, you know, when I would group together, we have these invoices from from the companies just like this, but then it would just break them into like, one single line where it has, you know, the the amount of each invoice and then that total for that company that you're paying, like, just just like we have on the right here like that the stuff on the right would pretty much stay. The stuff to the left would be right, majorly simple, like you'd show the PIO number. And that's probably about it. And the item the item cost per like, you need the vendors invoice number and the item cost per vendors invoice and that's really about all you

Speaker 3  1:09:24
know, the vendors invoice number, like the invoice number they supply is this 506618 Okay, so do you need that and the PIO?

Unknown Speaker  1:09:32
No, we're not needed to do that.

Speaker 3  1:09:34
So you're saying like for ABC supply, you need 506 that you need that number. You need the discount expiration date, the discounts, the invoice, total invoice due date,

Speaker 2  1:09:46
and the status will be good just there should always say the same thing but either either that or there just be a criteria that if it's not that status, you know, never supposed to show up anyway. So

Speaker 1  1:10:02
you should you should never have anything in here it says unpaid approved. Right, right. And then I'm going to assume that the, and then do we want something on the payment tight. I can push it just a few minutes, but maybe we should get back to this. Well,

Unknown Speaker  1:10:29
the payment type should show up and you can go to your bank the end of the week.

Speaker 3  1:10:43
I'm gonna run the BIOS but okay. I think this is something that we have to keep pushing forward and start. Yeah. So you know what you want or what you need, if there's so thank you.

Speaker 2  1:10:59
Should I just send you something that would have the columns that we'd probably be looking for?

Speaker 1  1:11:05
I mean, if it's if it's different than what you just told me, yes. I'm also comfortable with just putting this together as a starting point. I wonder I might just, I might just mock up a report for you in a custom report before we take it standard. And you can take a look at it and see what you think about it.

Speaker 2  1:11:23
Yeah, sounds good. Yeah, that's just pretty much pretty much do it. I would make the columns sortable, especially the date columns, date and payment type columns should be sortable.

Speaker 1  1:11:39
Yeah, all of those columns should be I will sort by due date in descending order first, again. So it'd be the, it would be the vendor vendor with the earliest due date. So if a vendor has six invoices, one due today and the other is due 30 days from now they still all be grouped up at the top by vendor. Vendor? Yep.

Speaker 1  1:12:10
Trying to think okay, so. So that's that I will mock that up and get that. And then we could take I'll get an email, send a receipt and take a look. And then the only the other pieces is the undeposited funds. Is really, I mean, that is the receive payments report would be the undeposited funds report. No, there's going to be a deposit report. Right, right, that we that we can use to view a separate report for undeposited funds.

Speaker 2  1:12:50
Mark is this is this undeposited funds report that you have marked here is that like just to see what it's like no, that's that Wishful Thinker.

Speaker 3  1:13:02
Where we go into Select your deposits. Oh, that's

Unknown Speaker  1:13:06
your that's your depositing.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:09
Depositing process. But you're thinking well, that's that's underway. Why don't we take a look at it. Next one we talk.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:18
Yeah, that works.

Speaker 1  1:13:20
I think it's good. Yeah. All right. Awesome. Yep. Thanks. Yes, you as well.
