Hello hello

Unknown Speaker  00:59
See

Speaker 1  01:38
a sorry about the tardiness hey hey don't worries

Speaker 2  01:55
see I'm not I don't see Josh here yet but we are just gonna go ahead and jump in and share my screen

Speaker 2  02:17
so Mark was wanting an update on

Speaker 3  02:28
getting acid update update on the reconcile process but we can do that but mostly these three things

Unknown Speaker  02:37
okay on the reconcile process of shoot I think the only remaining piece are actually would you mind just calling that out

Unknown Speaker  03:02
now this one's linked wrong oops well it means that now the change request is like wrong that gotcha but we don't know where the

Unknown Speaker  03:21
okay so you know what let me look at what job I was committing stuff on

Unknown Speaker  03:55
no like oh

Speaker 1  04:05
searching is that I have implicit wildcards which is not true

Unknown Speaker  04:21
do you have 159578? No. Is it 1159578 I believe

Unknown Speaker  04:33
there we go. All right. So let's do

Speaker 4  04:38
do I need to rethink anything here or not?

Speaker 2  04:41
No, not on your Okay. I'm going to eat 738 This can go away All right, there we go. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  05:01
So

Speaker 1  05:07
I think the only remaining piece actually is the is adding validation to prohibit the deletion of reconciled transactions, which should not be difficult. But let me

Speaker 1  05:31
just attach a message to my future self

Unknown Speaker  05:49
against the election,

Speaker 1  05:52
but I think other than that it's ready to go. In terms of functionality, obviously, that job needs to actually be sent through testing.

Unknown Speaker  06:11
Given the update over the weekend, they effectively have access

Speaker 2  06:13
to it will cool that happen as well? Good. Okay. So,

Speaker 3  06:21
you did say validation is the one remaining piece but besides that, right, yeah.

Speaker 1  06:29
Okay, on this, no, I did not do my best case or ideally, or whatever I termed it is. But subject to testing. I believe I, I have the basic report. Sans percentages, which I'm in the process of adding, right at the moment, and I'm guessing there's a strong chance that I'll actually be able to get that done today. It's not interfaced on the menu, if he wants to look at it. I can give the information to do that. But

Unknown Speaker  07:29
no, we just

Unknown Speaker  07:33
and just get it ready and deliver. Yep. Brilliant.

Speaker 2  07:39
I don't think it's much sell for him to have it sooner than that.

Unknown Speaker  07:47
Don't think, okay, add asset groups?

Unknown Speaker  07:56
Yes, please. Go to View it says

Speaker 1  08:01
I think it is. So, yes, it's not reviewed, but I believe it's implemented.

Unknown Speaker  08:15
Group won't actually try adding it because they don't want to know what they want. But then. Yeah. Simple enough. Cool. So that is so technically,

Unknown Speaker  08:45
technically the job ever been tested?

Speaker 1  08:57
fast tracked, right. inadvertent fast tracking?

Speaker 4  09:04
So do we need to move that asset groups to does it need to go into testing as a stage or are we completing it? What's the outcome

Unknown Speaker  09:14
here? Well,

Speaker 3  09:19
I mean, technically, we should. From a project management standpoint, you should go into testing and then from Mark standpoint, it should basically be that it's in their court and they can, okay, they can play around, they can play around with it. Okay.

Speaker 4  09:32
How about the better sections on income statements? We're still in development on that, right?

Unknown Speaker  09:37
Yes. Yes, correct. Great.

Speaker 2  09:49
Good. It's on that front.

Unknown Speaker  10:05
I have a whole host of things I need to talk to Josh about, but

Speaker 3  10:10
this wraps it to talk to a ghost. Doctor ghost. Yeah. Good. Okay, well says that yet for if I'm helpful on. Yep, I think getting us around really and I will get back to coding. Okay, awesome.

Unknown Speaker  10:31
All right. Thanks to both of you. Good bye.

Speaker 3  10:38
Do you need anything? Andrew? I think I'm just gonna start working on stuff unless Jeff shows up.

Speaker 4  10:43
Yeah, I don't think so. I'm attempting to keep track of some of these inquiries and incoming tasks with some tags so so that I know where to answer questions, but no, I think I'm good. Do you want me to get back to mark on Joel's answers? Okay.

Unknown Speaker  11:04
That'd be great. Okay,

Speaker 4  11:07
I can do that. Sounds good. Cool. Awesome. Talk to you later. Bye.
