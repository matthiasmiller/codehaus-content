Unknown Speaker  00:21
Hello, Howdy. Howdy.

Matthias Miller  00:27
How is Life in the Carolinas

Speaker 1  00:36
good? I mean, the weather's been beautiful.

Unknown Speaker  00:41
That's awesome. It

Unknown Speaker  00:43
has been very nice,

Unknown Speaker  00:47
good, cool.

Unknown Speaker  00:51
I see you're launching some fun things.

Matthias Miller  00:54
I'm launching some fun things. Try not to get distracted by interesting side projects.

Speaker 1  01:08
I feel like, I feel like, well, I should have, I should have done what I know was, did the right thing to do over the weekend and the holiday is, I should have sat down and worked on this importing data so that I have I am way further than I am, and I didn't, and now I wish I had anyway.

Matthias Miller  01:32
Well, let's I mean, it seems to me I'm still waiting on just a tiny little bit from Seth, I think it could probably actually get started on accounting impact mockups. But what would you

Speaker 1  01:47
Well, let me so the biggest thing is right now. Okay, help me understand something. When you do an import, what does it how do the matches actually like? Is it? Is it everything in column A goes to what column A is defined as, or are you batching on headers?

Matthias Miller  02:15
Or you can do it either way.

Speaker 1  02:17
Okay, well, okay, so let's look. Let's look at some of these imports to make sure. So make sure I'm I'm understanding so so I'm not, because I feel a little bit lost if I have to go, if I have to go, spec all this data out in in exact columns, my mind wants to melt. And so let's start with contacts import.

Matthias Miller  02:41
Well, we go take a look import contacts. I'm going to guess it's positioning.

Speaker 1  02:46
Positioning. That's column A is column A, and Column B is column B. It's not, it's not based on headers,

Matthias Miller  02:52
yeah, let me share my screen. I could show you. So I got here. Sorry, this should be are you using comet, by the way, am I using what comet? Perplexities? Browser,

Speaker 1  03:08
Comet. Yeah, never heard of it.

Matthias Miller  03:20
Anyway. It's comments, it's perplexities, AI browser,

Speaker 1  03:26
so, so what? What's the given?

Matthias Miller  03:30
I mean, it should be, should be able to do things like this.

Speaker 1  03:40
Wait, how do you how did you have this in your like, in your calendar view?

Matthias Miller  03:48
I mean, this is, it's perplexity. It's a custom browser.

Unknown Speaker  03:55
How did you link it? How did you link it to your calendar?

Matthias Miller  03:59
It's it's the browser. If

Speaker 1  04:02
this is going to be the answer for everything I had, I mean, it could have a strange conversation

Matthias Miller  04:08
just that you just download the browser and you pull up the page, you pull up the assistant. It runs an agent, and,

Speaker 1  04:22
oh, comment browser, a personal AI assistant. Get comment. Is it free? Uh,

Matthias Miller  04:28
it might require $20 a month, or some perplexity, pro subscription, but all right, boom, done. It just added it to my calendar. Oh, you

Speaker 1  04:39
weren't watching. Sorry, I was good. Yeah, got it

Matthias Miller  04:45
like it just got done adding, can you add a two hour block from two to four today from your work on the working session? Boom, done. It went through and it did it.

Speaker 1  04:55
It's right here. So automatically assistant have to be like, does the calendar have to be open? Do the assistant or can you pop up the assistant from anywhere? I don't know

Matthias Miller  05:18
if it can do this or not.

Unknown Speaker  05:28
You've got to be freaking kidding me,

Matthias Miller  05:31
September three from 11 to here says 930 to 11

Speaker 1  05:40
is perplexity. The only one that's doing this with a browser,

Matthias Miller  05:43
perplexity, make a made a bid to buy chrome off of Google. Did you hear that? So Google may be required to split off chrome because of antitrust? I knew that, and so they made a bid for like, I don't know what it was, 100 billion. I don't know what it is. No, no. I said it was some stupid number. It was, it was an insanely huge number. Um, which, when you look at it, it's like they're basically paying $1 per user to get the browser, which is ridiculously cheap, like just brain dead cheap. It's just a big transaction, because, well, it's

Speaker 1  06:17
okay, so, so here's, here's okay side question. Then, of all the because you've chat GPT, you've used perplexity, you've used Claude, you've used, have you used grok as well some grok. So which, which? Which of these is, is giving you the best performance.

Matthias Miller  06:36
I love Claude. I have loved Claude for its writing and editing chat GPT for a you would appreciate this, without divulging all the gory details, I have a 454 page chat transcript for essentially, leadership, mentoring, Evolution, transformation, and I just started my round two onto my next 454, pages of this stuff through chatgpt. It's done incredibly well with that. I'm just starting with the AI tools in perplexity with perplexity in the browser. I've also had a lot of fun with notebook LM as well, mostly taking notebook LM, it's a, it's, it's, it's Google's thing. It hooks up to Google. I don't really have, I don't have a lot of a lot of stuff in here. To show you, I stuck my personal chat, GPT conversations and journal entries into here, and it makes it it's a very interesting thing on

Speaker 1  07:58
this is going to become a little bit like streaming services is that you're going to have to have like, three different AIS to really get the because I get hacked. Okay, currently I use two and a half right now because Leanne has a chat GPT, and there are many times I can't get out of grok, what I want to get out of. And so I'll go to chat GPT, and that will give me a totally different perspective. And then, or I want to go write something, so I jump over to Claude, and, you know, I pay, I pay for grok. Leanne pays for chat, GPT. I need to get Addison playing, paying for perplexity. And then we all three, have three different ais that we just use of each other's.

Matthias Miller  08:41
So let's, I'll show you this one. This is a I can show you this one. I don't feel like let's see where's My where my zoom window went?

Matthias Miller  09:02
Sure? Share

Matthias Miller  09:20
I mean, this is just another I mean, the biggest thing is just that it connects up to

Matthias Miller  09:37
connect to Google Docs. So if you've got a lot of SOPs in Google Docs, the other really interesting thing is you can do audio and video overview mind

Speaker 1  09:50
maps. Gotcha. So how many, how many of these platforms are you currently paying for?

Matthias Miller  09:56
Notebook LM is included. I pay for perplexity. Opus

Speaker 1  10:00
notebook is elements included with what Google Suite.

Matthias Miller  10:04
I believe it really maybe it might be an upgrade. I'm not sure. Chat, GPT, Claude, I have been using mid journey for a while.

Speaker 1  10:16
I got I quit using the journey. I feel like mid journey was not giving good results at all. I feel

Matthias Miller  10:24
like it was more structured than, unless wild west than chatgpt, but I don't know. Anyway, there's anything else otter, which is still AI. Okay, so there, so this is contacts, so you can see column column layout is fixed position versus column label. So then if we go to Import, what else do we have

Speaker 1  10:57
go to Accounts? How are accounts set up? Um, wait, that's accounting. Never mind. Go back. Go back to, that's accounting configuration. Wait, they did okay. Where are they? Okay? They sent me an email with several imports that they did like, products import. Go, go to the go to the Products page and see if there's a products import there.

Matthias Miller  11:19
No, it's not in here. Because, okay, so let's go to from Sean, do product, import, link to import

Unknown Speaker  11:32
new product. Okay, it's,

Matthias Miller  11:34
it's under, it's because,

Unknown Speaker  11:38
oh, it's under. It's under User folders got it

Matthias Miller  11:41
so new book depreciation is also fixed position. Okay, new product is also fixed position. But if you wanted to, you could tell them to

Speaker 1  11:55
change it. No, I just want to make sure I understand what I'm looking at, so that when I go build, when I'm building out this data, okay, I'm going to share, Let me share this document with you,

Speaker 1  12:15
messiahs. Messiahs. Okay? You're going to, whenever you get in here, you're going to see a data dump coming out of RTO Pro, 500 line items. Well, 499, to be precise.

Matthias Miller  12:39
Are you emailing? Are you?

Speaker 1  12:40
Yeah, should show up an email. Sorry. Okay,

Speaker 1  12:51
there you are. So essentially, I'm working on the customer page, where I'm basically just array formulas, getting stuff out of the sheet one, and so I can construct it in the manner that I that it matches up with what the imports are. Got it. So I'm slowly working like most of okay, contact, record stuff, product, record stuff, contract, record stuff. I think most of this stuff I can build out off of most of this data, and then I'm just gonna have to fill in for you know, information that we haven't had. Riddle me this if, if you go to product page on both tags, not tags, sorry, sales person, if we don't have these sales person, it will. It'll just stomp it in, right?

Matthias Miller  13:44
Sorry if we don't,

Speaker 1  13:46
if we don't have, if we don't have a contact record for the sales person, initially, it will just stop it in, or just ignore

Matthias Miller  13:54
it. I don't think it will. I think it'll fail. I think we should create a salesperson import.

Speaker 1  14:04
Well, I mean salesperson imports, just a contact record import, and setting the type which I can do. I just want to make sure that I like. What I wanted to make sure is I know what's going to happen if I it, whether I need to have certain records prior to actually pushing some of this data.

Matthias Miller  14:19
I'm going to guess if it's done right? I don't think you should be able to set salesperson. Okay? I think if it lets you import it, it's a bug, because you should have a salesperson of type blank, which is what it's going to end up being. So I don't know if it'll let you do it or not, but it shouldn't let you do it.

Speaker 1  14:38
So in other words, you're saying if, if I push a contact, if I push a product record in and it's not in the drop list, then it should fail, correct. Okay. Well, that's good to know, because I have it's own. Like I told, I told Garak, I need, I need 15 sales people randomly assigned to 499, rows. Yep, and, and. So I have the list of sales, but I just got to make sure go into them first. That's good. That's good information to know. Okay.

Matthias Miller  15:07
I mean, it's, it would also, it'd be very trivial. So the other sorry, let me finish my thought. Be very trivial to so what I would do is sorry, let me I'll get back to my thought. I would use a sample, the sample files he gave you, paste the header columns, since you know what you need to fill in, yeah, but

Unknown Speaker  15:25
they didn't. They didn't give me a contact export,

Matthias Miller  15:28
all right, so you get that here, but the contact

Speaker 1  15:31
export, that's there is like, it doesn't export all the same columns that I saw on

Matthias Miller  15:38
on their contact import,

Unknown Speaker  15:40
yeah, try go to the contact export.

Matthias Miller  15:48
Oh, because we needed it won't let me. You needed additional columns added to it.

Speaker 1  15:59
Well, okay, when I did a contact export of what's there, it did not seem to match up with with the import. Now, maybe it does. Maybe I'm just an idiot. I

Matthias Miller  16:10
don't know, a okay, it ends with AI contact.

Speaker 1  16:15
It is all there. Well, okay, do me a favor. Then just copy the headers off that one that you just had, that you had up there, copy all the headers and drop it in my my data for only customer record or customer sheet.

Matthias Miller  16:29
Let me throw it in here and come on. I

Matthias Miller  16:51
Excuse me, while it loads five years later, what it's doing, but sure is complicated, not quite sure What it in HubSpot migration, but that's fine.

Unknown Speaker  17:09
Come on.

Unknown Speaker  17:27
Boom, that'll

Matthias Miller  17:28
make your life easier.

Speaker 1  17:31
So what is, yes, that will make my life a lot easier. What is contact, address, type one, I don't understand. What's the type one? Oh, is that? Is that? That's if there's two string mailing, got it? Never mind. I know what this means. If there's not a secondary address, we just use type one.

Matthias Miller  17:53
I mean, type one is type is only required if you've got multiple addresses, I believe, so you leave it blank. It's really so

Unknown Speaker  18:06
what's the difference between E and F? Is that the display address,

Matthias Miller  18:13
it's something like this, or shipping or

Matthias Miller  18:20
these are the valid values here, mailing or physical.

Speaker 1  18:28
Got it if I, if I, if that is blanket, what will it default to? Nothing,

Unknown Speaker  18:33
nothing. And I believe

Matthias Miller  18:36
it's only required if there's multiple rows, if you have multiple addresses,

Speaker 1  18:39
right? So I can leave it blank. I would leave it blank. Okay, perfect. Okay, got it. This is super helpful.

Matthias Miller  18:47
So this one you could do see, this makes it so much easier. Look at that. Bad about a boom,

Unknown Speaker  18:57
what? Now? Oh, I

Matthias Miller  18:59
moved your city state and zip over because you didn't have a column for address too. Now you don't have to go figure it out. It just

Speaker 1  19:04
works. Look at there. Look at there. Okay, perfect. All right, that's, that's super helpful. Um,

Speaker 1  19:19
I gotta figure out how I'm going to create history on some of these contracts. But, oh well, we'll figure that out in another time and then another time in life. Okay, so things that I don't have all my data in yet. What do you want to work on today?

Matthias Miller  19:36
Well, I would love, I would love to get the financial accounts set up. But maybe that's not a you and me conversation. Maybe that's a you go do something else conversation and get it in here chart of accounts on the financials.

Unknown Speaker  19:56
So

Unknown Speaker  19:59
can. Or the

Matthias Miller  20:00
rock thing, huh? Maybe that's a rock thing.

Speaker 1  20:05
Well, okay, I mean, between the Well, between the sample chart of accounts that I sent you out of QuickBooks, most likely people are going to be coming from QuickBooks, so probably they're going to want to name their accounts and their their account numbers to be very, very

Matthias Miller  20:18
similar. Can you give me an Excel file of that,

Speaker 1  20:21
oh, probably, preferably

Matthias Miller  20:24
not the one with the weird income one, but the overhaul one, I think that's fixed.

Unknown Speaker  20:31
Okay, let me go,

Matthias Miller  20:32
Okay, if I add, oh, that's okay, yeah, if that's the way, it's gotta be,

Unknown Speaker  20:37
gonna be so persnickety, per schnitkey. I kitty.

Unknown Speaker  21:00
Why am I whistling to you? I don't know,

Matthias Miller  21:04
because it's fun. That's why I love to whistle to me.

Speaker 1  21:15
Actually, actually, I have a better idea. I have a better idea. I do. I do, here you go, here you go. I'm gonna let you get in here and download what you want. And I first gotta find the password for this. Hold on a second. I gotta find the password. Password, password, where did she send this to me?

Unknown Speaker  22:09
Oh, I might as well just ask her. Let's see if she'll answer.

Unknown Speaker  22:56
I Here it is, never mind. Never mind.

Unknown Speaker  23:21
Are you in?

Matthias Miller  23:23
Just saw that message.

Unknown Speaker  23:26
Oh, look at that. We're already in overhaul. So what's going you are being slow. Very slow.

Matthias Miller  23:39
It's it's the Tuesday after the Liberty.

Unknown Speaker  23:46
I hope you know where you're going. Look at that he does,

Matthias Miller  23:58
actually, I think I

Unknown Speaker  24:05
in Excel.

Matthias Miller  24:15
Thank you. All right, but about a boom?

Speaker 1  24:24
Hang on a second. You may need to go. You may need to grab the file and take it to your to your computer. Let's go see,

Matthias Miller  24:35
hang on a second. That is freaking cool. What's that? While you're 3d printing, I'm doing this.

Speaker 1  24:48
He's over there writing books. Where did it put it? Where did it put it?

Unknown Speaker  25:11
Don't think it's going to let you copy any of this if we don't have a

Speaker 1  25:26
Yeah, I can't copy any of this. Where did it? Where did it save the file to?

Matthias Miller  25:30
Do you have, do you have access to Google Drive on

Unknown Speaker  25:33
here? Yeah, but I mean, I need to figure out where it saved the file.

Speaker 2  25:39
File. Well,

Matthias Miller  25:48
not doing any my shortcuts,

Unknown Speaker  25:51
yeah, because my, I don't have a, I don't have a, a whatchamacallit account

Matthias Miller  26:00
here. Well, let's do this. Then, where we can, we can do this.

Unknown Speaker  26:11
There you go. Uh, you're cooking with some gasoline,

Matthias Miller  26:16
gasoline. We are going to play with gasoline and fireworks.

Matthias Miller  26:30
All right, and then I need a way to get that out.

Speaker 1  26:32
Okay? Now you probably don't. I have to probably get this thing for you. I have a transfer files. Okay, there you go. Oh, to download files,

Matthias Miller  26:43
learning the person on the other side will get access to

Unknown Speaker  26:45
your CSV. Yeah, give me a second here.

Matthias Miller  26:49
Irreversible. Once the data leaves the account, you cannot get it back. It may go out onto the interwebs.

Speaker 1  26:55
Transfer, transfer, Okay, where is this thing? I'm blind as a bet there's a downloaded local piece. There it is. Yeah, got it all right. So let's get Z sub. I just have to

Matthias Miller  27:07
drop

Unknown Speaker  27:08
it. Yeah, I'm dropping, I'm dropping into, into Cigna alley. Seniority,

Unknown Speaker  27:26
let's do this,

Matthias Miller  27:34
actually. No, this isn't what I want. I want. I

Unknown Speaker  27:43
Okay, come on.

Matthias Miller  27:55
This guy, all right, signal, I

Matthias Miller  28:16
Okay, so now let's go into the

Matthias Miller  28:30
out subtitle for financial accounts and account Number. We're not using number here. Let's do this export. Oh, come on. Let me go into my let me export my accounts and then

Unknown Speaker  28:57
grab the format okay,

Matthias Miller  29:08
we're not using account number. Actually, we are

Unknown Speaker  29:16
great,

Matthias Miller  29:19
also great. I thought we had a

Matthias Miller  29:33
migrate to a

Matthias Miller  29:46
translator workbook.

Matthias Miller  30:08
Maybe not. Okay, so we want the maybe we want a different

Matthias Miller  30:23
1520, let's do this, Customize Report.

Unknown Speaker  30:35
All right, well, let's do this. Um,

Matthias Miller  31:13
everything too.

Speaker 1  31:18
I mean, does it? Does it seem logical to you that if an RTO company is coming from QuickBooks, that they would want to go through some sort of naming convention that mirrors what they were doing in QuickBooks. Or do you think they're

Matthias Miller  31:33
going to want to restart? I would think most of them just want to keep going with what they did. Yeah, okay, this is, this is should be moved up one.

Unknown Speaker  31:48
Okay,

Matthias Miller  31:49
so this one actually, yeah, p2 p2 then I want to have whatever that number is.

Speaker 1  32:17
Oh, you've got to be kidding. You can do perplexity directly into a Google sheet like this.

Matthias Miller  32:22
Well, it's not, I'm not making it, do it, but I'm sure I could.

Unknown Speaker  32:26
I'm just,

Unknown Speaker  32:31
I call foul, no fair.

Matthias Miller  32:34
Okay, so we need

Speaker 1  32:42
anything. I may need to switch to to this. If this, if this is the case, oh two, is it able to read information directly out of your sheet?

Matthias Miller  32:53
Should be able, I haven't tried it again. I'm taking the Lazy Boy approach, but it should be able to

Unknown Speaker  33:07
and then here

Speaker 1  33:12
change, sorry, but the your, your, whatever you Call your, your three letter denotation for the company's zfp Sounds like a fart and zert Sounds like a mistake.

Unknown Speaker  33:30
Zert. Hey,

Matthias Miller  33:35
you gotta go. You gotta go. I Let's

Matthias Miller  33:57
see if it actually

Matthias Miller  34:05
well, it didn't really.

Matthias Miller  34:11
So what we wanted, actually, was this one up here. This is column, O, array, formula, O, 2o,

Unknown Speaker  34:30
and then a trim, okay,

Matthias Miller  34:36
and then the parent account number

Matthias Miller  34:57
did these literally get cut off, or is it just. Just

Unknown Speaker  35:02
now you gotta be kidding Me. I

Matthias Miller  35:42
you send me that can

Speaker 2  35:52
you send me that one? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  35:58
okay, where's the refresh on here? What did you What did you download? There's

Matthias Miller  36:03
a chart of accounts too in the downloads.

Speaker 1  36:08
Oh, where's the refresh button on here? That's strange.

Unknown Speaker  36:37
Diego, okay, all

Matthias Miller  36:41
right, let's see if we got the foreign rental income.

Matthias Miller  36:50
Wait, where do I go? Where?

Unknown Speaker  36:54
What signal?

Matthias Miller  36:57
Not seen it. I see a chart. Check my phone. It comes from my phone. Oh,

Unknown Speaker  37:02
dear me. Doesn't

Unknown Speaker  37:11
help to send it to Josh.

Matthias Miller  37:15
Probably, probably he has less

Speaker 1  37:17
benefit. He says, riveting. Someone else, maybe, for Pete's sake, I just literally, I just literally, okay. I just opened up signal and dropped the file and didn't look who I was dropping it to. And apparently Josh was the last person I talked to. That's funny, so dangerous when you don't pay attention.

Matthias Miller  37:46
Yeah, well, that's not the worst thing I've heard from wrong threats. So,

Matthias Miller  38:01
okay, so now see if these are non these are still truncated, you booger. Um,

Matthias Miller  38:25
let's go back to this guy like,

Matthias Miller  38:33
literally, it won't let me do anything because it's not you can't copy it out. Nothing. Well, my account names are getting truncated in the CSV. That's my problem right now.

Unknown Speaker  38:53
Okay, hold on one second. Let me. Let me think. Here.

Speaker 2  39:02
Try what just happened?

Speaker 1  39:19
Where are let's see C drive QuickBooks. Just want to see if they're copying out somewhere else.

Unknown Speaker  39:53
Type we have r and.

Unknown Speaker  40:05
Have the subtype.

Matthias Miller  40:08
Actually, we don't have the subtype

Unknown Speaker  40:15
description.

Unknown Speaker  40:31
Where is it? Throwing these things?

Matthias Miller  40:45
It's probably not actually, literally creating a file. It's using, mean, the way they they've done in the past, it's just been create automation.

Speaker 1  40:54
Okay, so then in that regard, so then let's do this. Let's log out of here. Sign Out and let me go to a user that I think does have an Excel account. I'm

Unknown Speaker  41:52
Come on.

Matthias Miller  41:54
I mean, theoretically we could also just manually.

Unknown Speaker  42:03
To fix them up

Matthias Miller  42:07
or just delete them, like, do we actually need these are just years? Can we just delete these rows because we're not going to break them up by years?

Matthias Miller  42:23
Um, probably, I think we can, which basically solves the issue,

Speaker 1  42:31
Oh, gotcha, I see what you're saying. So, oh yes, yeah. So you want your, your gotcha, yes,

Matthias Miller  42:39
because the only, the only ones that are intolerably long are the ones where you've got years all the way out to Wazoo Yeah,

Speaker 1  42:49
I would like to get this actually for you. Maybe I'm retarded.

Matthias Miller  43:00
I get paid for software, not for cognition assessments.

Matthias Miller  43:12
Okay, what's the depreciation parent category called cogs depreciation?

Speaker 1  43:23
What's the parent category called? Yeah, me, and you want me to be looking in QuickBooks and tell you what the parent

Matthias Miller  43:29
category is called, or like, yeah, seven, 770, 40, yeah.

Speaker 1  43:33
Give me. Give me. Bear with me. I'm trying to get back. I'm trying to get why can't QuickBooks? You're being aggravating. Okay, fine, let I'm out of here. Let me get out of this. Log out, sign out back over to it. Wait a minute. What

Matthias Miller  43:55
did I just Oh, you stinker. But well, that's an easy solution.

Speaker 1  44:11
All right, I'm pulling this over to my big screen, and you're going over here on my little screen, because I'm tired of looking at a tiny screen. But

Matthias Miller  44:27
I'll download Excel. All right, let's see what we can break.

Unknown Speaker  44:37
Word accounts. I'm

Matthias Miller  44:54
the account name type is required. Field, line 108, line. 108, fine. That's

Speaker 1  45:01
probably just if a software takes this long to load.

Unknown Speaker  45:11
Wait a minute.

Matthias Miller  45:14
Updated records, records not oh, I want to wait. Okay, let's go.

Unknown Speaker  45:31
All right, I'll be right

Speaker 1  45:34
back. I gotta ask Leanne a question, because I don't know what I did. I'll be right

Unknown Speaker  45:37
back. All right.

Unknown Speaker  46:12
What the world

Unknown Speaker  46:27
Okay, fine,

Speaker 2  46:33
fine. I'm I'm I think that.

Unknown Speaker  50:52
Yes, I know I'm muted.

Matthias Miller  50:53
Okay. Would you be able to shoot me a CSV with the subtype

Unknown Speaker  50:58
I QuickBooks is being

Matthias Miller  51:02
aggravating. Don't, don't worry about, don't worry about fixing the cutoff. I don't care about

Speaker 1  51:07
that. Don't worry about, I can't even get back into the overall file now. Oh, and it's like, Do you know how to switch companies?

Matthias Miller  51:17
We went to open recent last time, and we pulled it off the recent list. The

Speaker 3  51:21
problem is, I think you're going to have to use the reinstaller because something happened that I don't know who or what, but it's only showing one now,

Speaker 1  51:30
if you're, if you're, if your data is so fragile,

Matthias Miller  51:36
yeah, we, we mysteriously have silver loom databases disappearing for no reason at all, where you have to reinstall your computer stuff. Sorry. End of sarcasm. Um,

Speaker 1  51:45
precisely. But why is there? Why is there no overhaul file like there's no there's no file like this for overhaul in here, there usually is restored, overhauled, six, nine, that's 24

Speaker 3  52:02
we had this issue last year, and we had to reinstall everything. Reinstall the last I used it was last week, and it was working then, and I did that.

Speaker 1  52:15
Okay, here's here's 828. Overhauled. 328, overhauled. Nine to 25 but this is the one. Let's try this one. QuickBooks data is structured so weird. Yes, server loom has database that just, you know, randomly disappear. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  52:38
we just well for people who missed QuickBooks, we just we have code that mysteriously takes it offline periodically, just to make it better for

Speaker 3  52:46
you, seriously considering changing his job description as to an accountant working in QuickBooks looks like you have more knowledge of this than I do when it comes to reinstalling things.

Speaker 1  53:02
So reinstalling, so I'm not and reinstall. I'm just trying to, like, literally trying to

Matthias Miller  53:06
open the file and it won't open. Should I share your screen?

Speaker 1  53:10
Hold on, copy. Drop to you. I

Matthias Miller  53:26
So this integrity, so then you're trying to get

Speaker 1  53:29
to, yeah, I like, literally my second one there is, it just does nothing.

Matthias Miller  53:35
If you, if you close this one, or you go file, whatever. So let's do this. It's crazy how little stuff has changed in the last 20 years.

Speaker 1  53:47
Sure. No, I don't what go away. I just,

Speaker 1  53:58
yeah, this is what I keep coming up. I keep coming up one more time. Hang on. Let's try. Let's try this. I keep getting an overhaul file issue, and if

Matthias Miller  54:08
this doesn't work, we can do a repair on it. I

Unknown Speaker  54:11
don't know how to do repair on it. Well,

Matthias Miller  54:15
you get out your little scooter, thing that you lay on your back on with little rollers, pull out your wrenches, get under your computer.

Speaker 1  54:23
Obviously, this is not working. So okay, so tell me, tell me what to do,

Matthias Miller  54:27
open, open QuickBooks. See The

Speaker 1  54:31
weird part is it from QuickBooks itself, you can't even find the over file. So then go to

Matthias Miller  54:43
wait for the wheel doomed and hit Cancel,

Unknown Speaker  54:49
cancel,

Unknown Speaker  54:50
yep, hit File,

Matthias Miller  54:53
restorating open or restoring existing company.

Unknown Speaker  54:58
Um. Store backup,

Matthias Miller  55:04
no, I thought there was a here. Let's go ask perplexity. Um,

Matthias Miller  55:30
we could have hit Cancel. You should have control, don't you? Oh, yeah.

Speaker 2  55:39
File, why

Speaker 1  55:59
do people put up with this,

Matthias Miller  56:01
because there aren't any there. There aren't real good

Unknown Speaker  56:11
alternatives.

Speaker 1  56:14
There's not better alternatives. Like, I mean, people know about, people know about, wait a minute, the file doctor may be out on the main screen. Well, okay, there you go.

Matthias Miller  56:26
It says it's out of sync. So I don't know. I don't

Matthias Miller  56:34
know what it what it just did. File utilities.

Speaker 1  56:47
As I was saying, if your data is so fragile that you have to have file doctors,

Matthias Miller  56:55
we have had to. So I mean, but realistically, I mean, hard drives are just we run it. Run into St. We ran into the same thing with investor tools. Just because people put stuff on a NAS, they do all kinds of weird stuff. And okay, but now I don't have any idea where this thing actually is.

Unknown Speaker  57:19
Try downloads. Try downloads. Let's put it in

Matthias Miller  57:21
downloads that would help.

Matthias Miller  57:35
Like in the worst case scenarios, we could literally open up database files in a in an editor, binary editor, to manually fix them up just because of weird stuff that literally should never happen. But did NAS or hard drive failure or some SAR, okay, well, I have this Um, so let's try though. Let

Unknown Speaker  58:18
me go back. I'm

Unknown Speaker  58:28
Yeah,

Matthias Miller  58:32
it's in use. Oh, I know who's using it, this guy.

Unknown Speaker  58:35
No,

Unknown Speaker  58:38
try your. Try your. Okay.

Speaker 1  58:49
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, oh, man, if I log out, you're gonna get logged out. I have a feeling I know where it's in the other in the other, whatchamacalliter, where I tried to open it session.

Matthias Miller  59:01
Well, you, I mean, you can log out and I can log back in.

Speaker 1  59:05
Uh, hang on. Hang on. Can I leave you here and go do another v2 cloud login. Um, hold on. A second. The two cloud I'm gonna, I'm gonna change browsers so I can keep you because why

Speaker 1  59:33
wouldn't I want to run two instances to BT club, b2 cloud from the same computer? Why

Matthias Miller  59:37
don't we do why wouldn't I it's called,

Speaker 1  59:41
it's called. I don't know what I'm doing. Come on, why is my computer so slow? Ah, okay. So now I need over here. I need this.

Matthias Miller  1:00:08
Annotate this. Please just get the annotator out of there.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:36
App and solvable,

Unknown Speaker  1:00:41
okay, try again.

Matthias Miller  1:00:44
All right.

Speaker 1  1:00:46
Oh, did you get kicked? I got kicked. Okay, let me make sure this is all everything's out of here. Okay, this is done. Get rid of you. Get rid of you. Okay. Why did you get kicked? Oh, wait, I bet you got kicked because of, try your, try your, oh, look at that. We're in overhaul. Um, try refreshing and see if it lets you back in. Nope, I need a new link care screen. I can even you need a new link. That would be, that would be very smart, that it would refresh the URL,

Matthias Miller  1:01:32
done,

Unknown Speaker  1:01:35
bingo,

Matthias Miller  1:01:37
is this a session we have? Oh, well, okay. Well, this is all we need. Yes.

Matthias Miller  1:01:49
What in the hang? Okay, let's go into here, sub account, account type, other income? Well, maybe I don't Well, maybe I'm mistaken.

Speaker 2  1:02:13
New Account Type, I wish

Matthias Miller  1:02:31
I wouldn't have to select the tapes I don't get why it doesn't i

Matthias Miller  1:03:07
Okay, this is just dumb.

Matthias Miller  1:03:19
Surely there's a I'm.

Speaker 2  1:05:50
Sorry, okay, hang on,

Matthias Miller  1:05:56
liability, equity, revenue, I'm

Matthias Miller  1:06:30
thinking longer for a better answer. Thank you. How

Unknown Speaker  1:06:35
about you just give me the better answer. Forget the thinking longer.

Matthias Miller  1:06:38
Yeah, stop the thinking. Come on. I'm glad I don't have to report how long I thought about things. I thought for 14 seconds.

Speaker 1  1:06:50
Somebody asked you a question. You go hmm, thinking for a better answer,

Matthias Miller  1:06:56
we we need a parody of AI in real life. I it

Speaker 1  1:07:03
or, or you have to divulge how many, how long you, how many seconds you thought before answering. I was thinking for 14 seconds before giving you a better answer.

Matthias Miller  1:07:16
Or just or if you're tired poor connection, please try again. You

Speaker 1  1:07:31
know the next thing they're going to do is they're going to start tying it, let's say thought 14 seconds, and then I'll put $1 value cost to it. Wouldn't that be crazy if AI would tell you how much it costs for this, for this response, yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:07:49
and like, not literally what you're paying, but what they're paying for it, that would be insane. $5.25

Unknown Speaker  1:07:55
for that answer. I

Speaker 1  1:08:05
it's gotta be, it's gotta be like the heavy users aren't paying nearly enough, and the light users are paying way too much, way too much. It yes, 100%

Matthias Miller  1:08:18
100% I did not want to do that. Just clicked. I'll just

Matthias Miller  1:08:38
pretend I wanted to update my prompt. Did not mean to click that.

Speaker 1  1:08:51
Don't you hate when you go to find a piece of chocolate from your secret stash and find out it's been rated and it's now empty?

Matthias Miller  1:08:57
Don't you love when you go look at the public stash on the snack room table, and you find a granola bar for yourself.

Matthias Miller  1:09:09
No, you haven't asset fixed assets. I

Matthias Miller  1:09:26
Okay, fine, screw it. Okay, so we know that the type is

Unknown Speaker  1:09:49
asset,

Matthias Miller  1:09:54
and we have liability, which is all the way down to.

Matthias Miller  1:10:06
Uh, prepaid income, and we have equity and we have revenue.

Matthias Miller  1:10:29
And we have expenses.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:40
We have

Matthias Miller  1:10:42
revenue up one then we and it goes down to here.

Matthias Miller  1:11:00
We have expense, okay, so then for the assets, we have bank accounts, accounts receivable, loan that's accounts receivable, that's fair. Other current assets, other current asset,

Unknown Speaker  1:11:42
fixed, assets.

Matthias Miller  1:11:51
All the other assets are fixed assets. We have a liability. Should be an accounts payable, payroll, payroll loan. Not sure why these are other current liabilities.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:25
But I don't know that I want to

Matthias Miller  1:12:32
we have sales tax payable, so that would seem logical that we Use that for this prepaid income.

Matthias Miller  1:12:59
Okay, equity, we have

Matthias Miller  1:13:09
retained earnings. You have additional paid

Unknown Speaker  1:13:16
in capital

Matthias Miller  1:13:18
owners, distribution,

Matthias Miller  1:13:31
owners, draws the owners, distribution,

Matthias Miller  1:13:39
revenue and revenue we have Sales slash service revenues

Matthias Miller  1:13:56
comes down to refunds, except for

Unknown Speaker  1:14:04
return check,

Matthias Miller  1:14:07
although return check and Seems like return check would be Other revenue

Unknown Speaker  1:14:17
expense or

Matthias Miller  1:14:29
we need depreciation.

Matthias Miller  1:14:46
These would be, this is actually the other revenue for all intents and purposes, and then we have a gain or loss on sale of asset. Oh, okay, you don't. Sale of fixed assets aren't sold proceeds. Okay? This is where it gets weird. I would argue these should be

Matthias Miller  1:15:57
I'm really confused. Why do we Why do we have

Matthias Miller  1:16:07
do you make changes or not? COGS is under revenue currently, just seems wrong. Where

Unknown Speaker  1:16:15
are you? Where are you at

Matthias Miller  1:16:18
this part, right here, it seems to me like, do you want to break down barn sales paid out Barnes and charge offs on your balance sheet and income statement?

Speaker 1  1:16:40
You are asking the wrong person. This is not my forte, the gain or loss on sale of asset. Okay, let me lean and I had a long conversation, but do me try and yank her back here, she's going to be able to answer some of these questions better than questions better than I can. I would,

Matthias Miller  1:17:09
yeah, maybe, okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:17:11
let me grab us. Let me see she can grab i I'm

Speaker 1  1:19:39
she says, if we can do it in five minutes, in five minutes of time, she can help us. Can we do it? Can I think so. Okay, she she's finishing up a permit for logistics, and then if we can stay in five minutes time frame,

Matthias Miller  1:19:57
okay, I'm gonna. Copied it. Clone by sheet. I'm going to create a proposal,

Matthias Miller  1:20:18
and then this would be, where were we? 61

Matthias Miller  1:20:30
let's try 6100 Oh, it's

Matthias Miller  1:20:39
not gonna light me.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:47
Oh, we'll do this.

Matthias Miller  1:20:53
Come on, okay, we'll just have to do it separately, or we'll do it we'll do it separately. We'll do it up top,

Matthias Miller  1:21:14
and then we'll Do effectively, what we're looking for is,

Unknown Speaker  1:21:33
cogs,

Matthias Miller  1:22:15
and then We'll highlight these so you can quickly see them.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:22
And this is my proposal. You should

Matthias Miller  1:22:28
tell her that all she has to do is say yes for Ray, and then she doesn't have to take more time. Just rubber stamp it. Rubber Stamp it. I'm having claim to try importing it.

Matthias Miller  1:22:58
You don't make it easy.

Matthias Miller  1:23:13
Uh, line 102, okay, so this should go down through line 101,

Matthias Miller  1:23:27
surely, there's a way to

Matthias Miller  1:23:34
try, to try, how You like me now,

Unknown Speaker  1:23:39
how you like me now, I here,

Matthias Miller  1:23:43
version three. Oh, great, apparently, not very well.

Unknown Speaker  1:24:00
Oh, Well,

Unknown Speaker  1:24:21
you gotta be kidding me. Um,

Unknown Speaker  1:24:48
oh, I'm.

Matthias Miller  1:25:18
The system switches. Is, Where's this guy? I

Matthias Miller  1:26:41
right? So let me Give this whirl now.

Unknown Speaker  1:27:02
All right, I'm

Matthias Miller  1:27:45
it has to make type in passwords for everything. Okay, so we have 89 six switch to the VPN still not.

Unknown Speaker  1:28:07
Come on. Oh, hang on.

Matthias Miller  1:28:12
9196, it was looking at the wrong column.

Unknown Speaker  1:28:29
Nine, one,

Matthias Miller  1:28:41
okay, well, we might have to wait until

Matthias Miller  1:29:14
Okay, well, I think, I think theoretically, we have the, I guess we can make some changes here. Loan to overhaul and Sons should not be do we want to nix that? Do we want to keep it?

Unknown Speaker  1:29:28
Hold on a sec. Let me see. Let me see if she's make sure she didn't forget me. Yep.

Unknown Speaker  1:30:09
Looks like she's still dealing with a permit issue, so we may have to. I managed to ask her once, once she's question is, we obviously

Matthias Miller  1:30:20
don't want to put over all the suns in here. Do you want to I don't think we technically need this account. Do you want to get rid

Unknown Speaker  1:30:28
of it? Sure.

Matthias Miller  1:30:31
Let's see if there's anything else that looks a little do you want to use truist, or do you want to change the name of the bank?

Unknown Speaker  1:30:39
Just make it some bank, random bank.

Matthias Miller  1:30:49
Well, let's just, let's just, let's do this. We'll have to see what bank it is, customer, document, barn, buildings, furniture, accumulated depreciation. FICA, a commercial loan.

Speaker 1  1:31:07
So the only, the only bad part about this, most of this data that's coming in, is North Carolina data, and this particular company is doing all their late fees and so on and so forth. By Kentucky, Tennessee, Pennsylvania and New

Matthias Miller  1:31:25
York. We can, we can eliminate the state breakdown. Fine by me, any reason, yeah, let's,

Speaker 1  1:31:29
let's just eliminate the state breakdowns and your other fees, your other late fee stuff down here below, yeah, and your LDW,

Matthias Miller  1:31:45
and this could be just a payroll liability.

Speaker 1  1:31:55
There was a So, what's the we got? Oh, never mind. So that's but we got two, two revenue accounts for other RTO, don't we? Yeah, we do 40 370 20

Matthias Miller  1:32:15
other late fees and other RTO.

Unknown Speaker  1:32:21
We don't need two of them, do we? I don't

Matthias Miller  1:32:24
know what the difference? What's the difference?

Unknown Speaker  1:32:28
That's next one.

Matthias Miller  1:32:31
I mean, is this? Do we have do it two

Unknown Speaker  1:32:33
LD, two ldws as well?

Matthias Miller  1:32:36
There's an LDW here.

Speaker 1  1:32:41
No, I don't think we have two LEDs, so just Nick's, one of those. I'm not sure what the difference is. I think the 70, the 70, the 7000 series, because that's your miscellaneous income, your other income, and your le W what's the 4300 What would what's 4000 series, just

Matthias Miller  1:32:57
standard revenue.

Speaker 2  1:33:02
Should for

Speaker 1  1:33:24
either that or move, either that or the 7000 series goes up in the 4000 series.

Matthias Miller  1:33:33
Well, I mean,

Speaker 1  1:33:35
why? Why is Why do you I mean that seems when that, I mean, that would be in your, your barn, rental income, your and your other incomes, wouldn't wouldn't that be just under like, wouldn't that be like a 4200, or a 40,

Matthias Miller  1:34:00
if we really just eliminate all We did eliminate all parent child accounts.

Matthias Miller  1:34:12
Oh, come on.

Unknown Speaker  1:34:33
Hey, we've got her for five minutes.

Unknown Speaker  1:34:35
All right,

Speaker 1  1:34:39
make it a little bit larger. We are here. She didn't bring her glasses. She says,

Matthias Miller  1:34:45
I could, I can't grab here we go. Just wanna make sure, I think, I mean, we had talked about this, but make sure I'm on the right track. So does it sound right to you to split cogs? Just have a single cogs. Line item, break it down into some. Accounts for paid barns, paid out barns and charge offs or barn sales, paid out Barnes and charge offs and similar, for gain or loss on sale of asset.

Speaker 3  1:35:11
You want to only have one category or that you are going to put subcategories,

Unknown Speaker  1:35:16
well, sure, sure, what the original had.

Matthias Miller  1:35:18
Well, the original was, well and they had cogs for accumulated depreciation, the cost of building the and the actual depreciation, which just to me is

Speaker 3  1:35:31
I think we can certainly simplify that. I do know that there are some very opinionated people in this industry that want to see it certain ways, but I don't see why. You could just add additional accounts for those individuals who want to have it that way, and make your base nice and clean and simple.

Speaker 1  1:35:49
Okay, let me. Let me translate this. Let's set this chart of accounts up the way it makes sense from an accounting standpoint. And if somebody wants to do some silliness, if they

Speaker 3  1:35:57
want to proliferate accounts, there's always they're welcome to do so the option to do so is that fair? Sure,

Speaker 1  1:36:03
that's fair. And then down the road, that's, I think that's the rubber I think that's the version of rubber stamping, your idea. Okay, I mean, but

Matthias Miller  1:36:12
it doesn't seem same for out of the box breaking apart charge. This is not the same terms we're using in the system, so we'll probably rename them, but breaking out into these three categories,

Unknown Speaker  1:36:23
it does okay.

Matthias Miller  1:36:27
And then is there a Do you know offhand whether late fees make more sense as revenue or other revenue, or income or other income,

Speaker 3  1:36:37
I would typically Mark late fees as other income, okay, state by state, sometimes it's taxed differently, which is part of the reason you want to track it differently. Yep.

Matthias Miller  1:36:49
I think that's, I think that's all I have. All we need is good enough for first pass this.

Speaker 1  1:36:57
Okay, no, I don't this is, I can make up a wildly good opinion, but it would there. I look at some of this stuff, and I go, why are we doing it this way? And then Matthias is, why are we doing it this way? And then I'm like, Ah,

Unknown Speaker  1:37:15
Kellyanne, bring Leanne, Gary Morgan. That's why.

Speaker 1  1:37:17
Because Gary Morgan, that's why. Okay, fair enough, but we do not want to duplicate what Gary Morgan is that all we needed. I

Matthias Miller  1:37:23
think that's all we need. I think this is I'm pretty comfortable doing this and running with it, and we can always, okay, yeah, adapt later. Yep.

Unknown Speaker  1:37:33
All right, good, absolutely.

Speaker 1  1:37:38
What's, what barrier Did you run into on in pushing this in,

Matthias Miller  1:37:44
we didn't turn on account numbers in the test system, and I think it makes sense to use account numbers in the test system. Gotcha. So I'm going to go ahead and download this one as a CSV and Ask chatgpt. GPT.

Unknown Speaker  1:38:16
Dude, what did we do before AI?

Matthias Miller  1:38:23
I have no idea. I mean, it is so crazy. It's so insane.

Speaker 1  1:38:48
Okay, random side question, why are vinyl? Why are insights, account numbers so long,

Matthias Miller  1:38:58
just to allow room for expansion, okay? Okay, then the expenses should be, yeah, that's 6000 Okay, that's, that was my bad, Mixed granularity,

Matthias Miller  1:39:20
6151 61, 55,050,

Matthias Miller  1:39:34
1050, 25,000,

Matthias Miller  1:39:40
I mean, I'm fine with that 5000 DO I LOOK picky?

Matthias Miller  1:39:57
Sort of 6000 I mean, I think.

Matthias Miller  1:40:09
But I am using 64

Matthias Miller  1:40:21
maybe argue there should be 6060, 10, but

Matthias Miller  1:40:38
60, 4060, 5060, 5060

Matthias Miller  1:40:48
I mean, really do we care? If

Matthias Miller  1:41:17
you want great angler data Job Costing classes or items, that's good enough. Okay, so,

Speaker 2  1:41:39
all right, I'm well,

Matthias Miller  1:41:53
are these the right terms? Barn, sales, payout, barns, charge offs, they seem wrong.

Matthias Miller  1:42:04
They don't seem to fit the

Speaker 1  1:42:19
Well, here's again. Remember, this is, this is, this is sample data. And we don't have to have it. We don't have to have our naming conventions correct. It's sample data, as long as we can explain what it is. So if you want to go rework the name, Fine, let's rework the name. I uh, again, some like I said this, some of this was, was carry over from Gary Morgan's office, and they did some whack a noodle things.

Matthias Miller  1:42:54
So we have, um, paid out, charge up or pay out,

Unknown Speaker  1:43:05
paid out,

Matthias Miller  1:43:08
Early payoff.

Speaker 1  1:43:15
I just had a brilliant thought, what's that?

Speaker 1  1:43:24
Moving to integrated accounting means I can go give an RTO company management services at a cheaper price to do their accounting. Yep, and it wouldn't cost. We might be able to do a couple percentage points more for accounting, but for the most part,

Speaker 1  1:43:56
set this thing up right, and it's just happens. There's no There's no manual transfer event of information. It's just it's happening. I mean, obviously you still have to go reconcile with your bank account, and still have to do some of those types of things. So you hire a mid level to low level bookkeeper, yep. Tell me I'm crazy.

Matthias Miller  1:44:24
No, I mean, I Why would you? I mean, you have one little bookkeeper on your team that manages for multiple clients.

Speaker 1  1:44:34
You want to be stinking cool. Have to get Leanne to on board with this idea. But our current management cost without accounting becomes the new management cost with accounting, maybe slightly more than that. We want to capitalize on our on our opportunity here. But seriously, right?

Matthias Miller  1:44:57
I like it. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, basically, we can do the accounting for you,

Speaker 1  1:45:08
and for, like, some of our for some of our, our clients that are not computer restricted, like, literally, we can give you a login, and voila, I gotta think about that.

Speaker 1  1:45:37
But dude, do you know? What do you know? Do you understand the power that is going to be so fun, if all of this is talking by the point all the data is in there. You can run income statements, balance sheet statements, and some of you like, can we look at that account right there? Sure click in into the ledger account. Be like, Okay, let me open this up. Okay. Link across to the the actual transaction. Here you go, right. Here it is, dude, that's insane.

Unknown Speaker  1:46:11
It is insane. That will be amazing. All right, okay,

Matthias Miller  1:46:16
well, I, I'm I'm stuck on running an update because it's broken and I ping Jonathan, and I'm waiting to hear back from

Speaker 1  1:46:23
him. We're at a we're at a great stopping point. Is what I hear you saying.

Matthias Miller  1:46:27
That's basically, we're at a great stopping point. I think, I think next steps could potentially be, let's go mock up some like, let's start mocking up accounting impact on this stuff. You're

Speaker 1  1:46:37
probably gonna need data that before you that, aren't you? No.

Matthias Miller  1:46:42
No, this is it depends,

Unknown Speaker  1:46:44
so we definitely good. You

Matthias Miller  1:46:49
need to go get data in,

Speaker 1  1:46:50
yes, but so we don't have a call scheduled until Thursday. I want to talk. I got time. I got

Matthias Miller  1:47:01
time tomorrow afternoon, if you want.

Speaker 1  1:47:05
I mean, my day is mostly open if I literally just shut everything off and like, just work at getting data in. It would be kind of interesting to talk late mid, mid afternoon or early afternoon. What do you? What do you

Matthias Miller  1:47:22
have for anytime from one to five your time?

Speaker 1  1:47:27
So I have to be on the same page meeting at 445 So somewhere between you, let's book. Let's Let's book, Between two and anywhere between 130 or two and four.

Matthias Miller  1:47:40
I mean, 130 is good for me, if that's good for you,

Speaker 1  1:47:44
yeah, let's just do it from 130

Speaker 1  1:47:56
on, all right, awesome. My my goal would be to get contacts in, products, in and contracts in that way I can work on building out payment history. Yep, that would

Matthias Miller  1:48:13
do, dude, you can almost taste this, can't you?

Speaker 1  1:48:17
Well, I mean, gonna have to just hold up and get it done? Yeah, I mean, because, I mean, here's I gotta, I gotta. Well, I guess you know what I could instead of, instead of trying to rework these dates, so I'm pulling old data out of, out of shed rentals and like date received on contracts is like 2014 I was like, okay, but actually what I need to do is I just need to go have I need to have grok just randomly generate start dates for this stuff,

Matthias Miller  1:48:51
yeah, or just add X number of years to it. Just added 11 years, or whatever it is. Well, I

Speaker 1  1:48:58
started to copy the dates in. What I was going to do is I was going to do is I was going to copy the dates and say everything, make it everything

Matthias Miller  1:49:05
from 2020, forward, sure.

Speaker 1  1:49:08
But that being said, there's no reason that I can't tell I could. I could just tell Brock go create 499, rows of of dates, the business, business, actual business days between 2020, and 2025, randomly generate them. Anyway, okay, I know where I'm going.

Matthias Miller  1:49:32
It's just got it. Okay. Fun times talk tomorrow. Alright, sir, yep.
