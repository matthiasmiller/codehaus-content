Unknown Speaker  05:34
hang on a second?

Unknown Speaker  07:26
Wi Fi issues switched over to my hotspot again anyway camp out yeah, we're planning to be in there. Cool. What we did last year was we actually went down a day or two early and stayed at sparkling springs

Speaker 1  07:51
just stayed at sparkling springs for camp out as well. Because tenting didn't seem like a great option with the little ones. I use mainly Briella with as young as she was. And sparkly springs it's free. So a whole lot cheaper than other options. And anyway, so it just it worked out really well like a 20 minute drive or something like that, but it worked out pretty well. So we might do something like that again this year. Because with the little baby

Unknown Speaker  08:30

Speaker 3  09:22
