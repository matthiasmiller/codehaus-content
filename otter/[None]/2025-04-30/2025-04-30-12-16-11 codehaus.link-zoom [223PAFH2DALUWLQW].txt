Matthias Miller  00:08
Text MERV that I am on Zoom And ready whenever You guys Are You

Matthias Miller  03:44
gotcha, ma'am, gotcha. Gotcha, all right, if you want to log in and share your screen and we'll dive in here.

Unknown Speaker  03:56
Wait, that's the wrong one. I

Speaker 1  04:09
Well, yeah, no, it's not the wrong one. What am I doing? It works. We're good. I just needed Joe.

Matthias Miller  04:17
One Tab over and you're good. There you go. All right, if you want to scroll up to the top, so and refresh, sure. All right, if you go, if you go, right, all right. So now we got size or can't lengthen here,

Matthias Miller  04:55
and the quantities correctly populating. So if you need to say. A, I mean, if you wanted to cut this out of six foot pieces, sorry, those are Yeah, or five foot pieces or something, they're just eight foot whatever. The can't quantity will update automatically for you, so you could put in try just, just for fun, try putting in 96 see what it does in

Unknown Speaker  05:26
the can length, yeah, okay,

Unknown Speaker  05:36
Mom, I'm struggling here.

Matthias Miller  05:42
All right, then and so that takes the quantity up to 39 total, total cans.

Speaker 1  05:52
Oh, okay, yeah, can't quantity, size or quantity per can would be down to 20, right? That's cutting a 40, yep, out of an eight footer, 240s Yep, that's it. Okay, and then,

Matthias Miller  06:08
and then the can't notes. You can change, if you need to change the species or something, you can do it there.

Unknown Speaker  06:15
Okay, right here. Yep. Do what clicked on the camera? Oh, goodness.

Unknown Speaker  06:36
Yeah. I

Unknown Speaker  06:54
Okay, all right, and then

Matthias Miller  06:58
we might want to dig into the pull up a brewer schedule and scalpy schedule and see if that looks a little better than it did previously.

Matthias Miller  07:13
So, I mean, yeah, the order should be, should be following sort order now, secondarily, by length, customers group together and scalpy. Scalpy just using the miscellaneous prep. One question did have? Hey, sorry, one question on the brewer schedule, are people confused on the pieces? Do you want the pieces column to show 770 or the 700

Speaker 1  08:01
currently, it's showing both. I like to have both. The way that you have it is the same as current. So okay,

Matthias Miller  08:08
so you would want, would you want the on each row to say 710% w equal 770

Speaker 2  08:22
i How could we put it that if we would get rid of the 10% waste equals 770 or you say, get rid of the 770 in the blue, in the blue cell, and keep in the white cell, keep the 700 parentheses, 10% ways equal 770 and then get rid of the 770 on the blue line. Could we do that or

Matthias Miller  08:53
not? I mean, we yeah, we can, if that's what you want,

Speaker 2  08:58
because I'm trying to weigh like if you get rid of the one in parentheses, and you just have 700 in the white cell and 770 in the blue, you mean, are they going to know? I mean, I guess it's a training tool that you don't mean, if it's smaller number, it's a minimum, if it's a higher number, it's a maximum.

Matthias Miller  09:19
Well, we could also a shorter way to show it, in the in the detail line would be a just 700 to 770 and just show a range

Unknown Speaker  09:31
that would work too, probably

Matthias Miller  09:33
like, what's I always go back to this from a business day to Day standpoint, what's, what's going to make you George most successful, and what's going to make, what's going to make the guys out of the shop most successful?

Speaker 2  09:51
I think I would like to have it just like, leave it the way it is. What that's going to help me too. With the tool of knowing I cut 10% whether I cut 10% 15% 13% 18% I can sort of follow that too, that, if you may say, the production guys came in. Hey, we ran out, we ran out, we ran out. So I know now that the 10% is not going to be enough, so I can plug in 15% change it in the standard thing, and make it a concrete is what I'm thinking right now. I mean, I'd have to get my feet wet too, but I think I like it the way it is right now.

Speaker 1  10:37
My My only suggestion then would be, while we eliminate the equal 770 and just have a 10% w in the parentheses. And then we know the waste factor that was applied. We know the minimum, we know the yield that we're shooting

Matthias Miller  10:58
for. Here's another idea that I think makes more sense coming in cold, is we do 770 and then parentheses, we do 700 plus 10% W, and it's a, it's a sum of of everything inside. Now you guys might say, hey, from that that makes no sense in our context.

Unknown Speaker  11:23
You put the numbers. How would you lay it out?

Matthias Miller  11:27
You would say 770 on the first row, top the first row, and then in parentheses, you would have 700 plus 10% W,

Unknown Speaker  11:37
okay. And then the bottom row you'd have 707

Matthias Miller  11:41
70. I, 70. Oh, so it's 770 the whole way through, and they know it's the max.

Speaker 1  11:50
Yeah. So 700 plus 10% W in parentheses up top, and literally say 770 once in the bottom. At the bottom,

Matthias Miller  11:59
well, we're showing multiple times, because you could conceivably have, wait. Do you even have?

Speaker 1  12:06
I wouldn't show multiple I don't, I don't think we want to show multiple times. So you could, you

Matthias Miller  12:11
could potentially. Isn't there a scenario where you're cutting where you're you got different sizes using the same size. Can't

Matthias Miller  12:30
like you could. I don't know what the case would be, but you could have multiple orders that have different size lumber, pulling from a three and a half by six by 10. And so in that case, you would have multiple rows underneath this. You might have a 770, you might have a 320, and a 580

Unknown Speaker  12:58
Okay,

Speaker 2  13:00
see if you can find, uh, go back to the main list. Wave 77 is there. Leave 77 in there somewhere. I think it's 77.5

Unknown Speaker  13:14
wave 75

Unknown Speaker  13:17
Yeah. Go back to that 175 Yeah.

Speaker 1  13:20
There is a seven, 7.5 Yeah. You want this one, yeah,

Speaker 2  13:25
let's try that quick one or yes, yeah, send that to almost see how it generates. Um,

Speaker 3  13:40
um, oh, here, sorry.

Speaker 2  13:54
Well, see that one there, Matt, I'm usually cut 16 foot. I mean, a real thing is if we have 100 inch cans out in the yard, which sometimes it doesn't happen. But I cut three and a half a 616 foot poplar, and then I cut 349 and three quarter and kick a think it's a 42 I was trying to find where it had the three and a half 616, foot ratio, just to see how it generates out onto that, but with a multiple cut like Matt was talking about, right where you're not just about the same exact size, you're getting multiple cuts

Unknown Speaker  14:37
where gets you here.

Speaker 1  14:43
240 pieces, 10% 264, are we using 100 and can't, oh, man, we're using 100 and we don't have that in there yet.

Speaker 2  15:00
I have to change that in the standard, standard thing. I'll do that when I go into that. Want to put all our pieces and stuff in right?

Speaker 2  15:17
Let me go back to the solo scene, the brewer schedule. So, like, Matt, if it's like a double combo, like, if I'm getting three cuts of one and one of the another size, it's going to be reading in miscellaneous preps, correct?

Matthias Miller  15:36
Yeah, I would. Well, I don't know. I might have to know specifics before I give you a good answer,

Speaker 2  15:45
right? I'm trying to find one that has do that 152 and 167

Unknown Speaker  15:53
that's right there. Yeah.

Speaker 2  16:17
Yeah, that's what it is right there. Out of that 10 footer up cutting a 52 and a 6152 and 167 so that's going to make that into the miscellaneous prep.

Speaker 1  16:31
So Matt, just go back to your point of multiple

Matthias Miller  16:37
same song. Let me, let me try. Let me see if I can find one. Here, square three and a half by six by 10. This is doing a I think I could do it like this, but let me try it.

Matthias Miller  16:59
Oh, that's a five and a half. That's why.

Matthias Miller  17:19
All right, refresh once All right, so here we have two different lumber lines coming out of the same can. And so we're showing 352, each for each of them, because that's includes the waste. We're doing separate rows because, because they're different lengths. And so my only point being just reading the report. It's confusing to have 640 in the in the in that row, and then to show it without waste first, and then show waste in the rows. And so make more sense to either have the rows show 320, or a range, or to have that row say 704, which is 640, plus 10% waste. Am I making any sense, or am I just completely not

Unknown Speaker  18:23
making sense? Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 2  18:27
But there's really what, 352 52 and 352, 67 but it's combined in both 52 and 67 in the total quantity. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  18:42
because they're, they're both coming out of the same

Speaker 2  18:44
size cans. But, if I would look at that right now,

Speaker 1  18:49
but, but it should only take because you're getting a 52 and a 67 out of the same can't. So it shouldn't be double. It shouldn't be doubling the can't count.

Speaker 1  19:10
Um, that's a different this is a different one, like we're trying to cut two jobs. We're getting one of the 50 twos and one of the 60 sevens out of that 10 foot. So do different problem, but Right?

Matthias Miller  19:24
It is different problem.

Speaker 2  19:26
And what I've been doing now in the old excel program, as you kept the 52 open, and then in miscellaneous prep, when I did 152 and 167 RW, because that's an RW 987, too. And then I put in the 352 pieces in the miscellaneous prep column. And rather than having two different columns, yeah, like the white and the blue, so I.

Matthias Miller  20:03
Well, I mean, if, if you're just looking for a shortcut on one of these, we could just say that.

Matthias Miller  20:16
I mean, you could put in inventory pieces for one of these. I which is going to show up, and then in the miscellaneous prep, just say, see above, and it would show up on the list. But it's clear that they're done together. I mean, that's not really, it's not very automatic, but it gets the ball rolling.

Speaker 2  20:55
I think it's just that number 640, 10% of w equals 704, I can see it taking it, as you know, made them cut 640, 50 twos and 60 sevens rather than, hey, it's combining both those as a grand total. I'm not, I don't know. I'd have to think about

Matthias Miller  21:17
that one, but that's where, if you, if you say, if, if you, if you say you got 320 in stock, it'll zero out the quantity, and everything comes out right, because you're already covering it in in another cut row,

Unknown Speaker  21:36
right? All right.

Matthias Miller  21:39
So, so if you jump back. Just, let's just play around with it. Just for sake of example, like on the See, I guess it'd be up at the top under the schedule, um, like, if you just pick the second one there and put in 320 for the for the inventory, and in the miscellaneous prep, You can just put in C above,

Matthias Miller  22:17
right there. I

Matthias Miller  22:34
Yep, and then when you go back on the cut list, it should be, should be enough that they kind of tell what's going on. Right? Is that workable?

Unknown Speaker  22:57
Yeah, change the quantity that's right

Unknown Speaker  23:02
under reading zero. 67

Unknown Speaker  23:03
right?

Speaker 1  23:13
Yeah, is it trying to think how to simplify this still should say 352 here, Matt, because you just do one to 352, that's the goal, and that is what's needed for the job. And this is where we're cutting it. So

Matthias Miller  23:30
really what you want to do is, I mean, we just need to have we just need to let you, we just really need to let you override the actual can quantity on individual items, sure, because you still have 352, pieces, and you just say, right, no, that's not true, because we're not using The can't quantity we're using. Wait a minute,

Unknown Speaker  24:02
you don't even have a can quantity in there.

Matthias Miller  24:06
Is that group row supposed to be camp quantity? Did I do that wrong?

Unknown Speaker  24:11
Where are you at that 320

Matthias Miller  24:14
or is that the total piece? No, that's total pieces. That's

Speaker 2  24:16
total pieces. We don't even have a can quantity in there.

Matthias Miller  24:21
So how would your total your total pieces is still, what am I missing? It's still 640 that is still the total pieces you want to generate.

Unknown Speaker  24:32
You. That's true.

Matthias Miller  24:36
It's the can't quantity that's wrong,

Unknown Speaker  24:40
right? Right. So,

Speaker 1  24:49
yeah, so what? Where is this? Okay, let me see here.

Unknown Speaker  24:58
All right, so change that. Yeah, if

Matthias Miller  25:00
you would change the can't length to how that's going to show up, wrong,

Unknown Speaker  25:06
you can

Matthias Miller  25:10
just go up and go up and copy it down or type it in.

Speaker 1  25:18
Well, you could say, see above. We could still say, see above

Matthias Miller  25:21
Right.

Unknown Speaker  25:30
Um, okay, so back to here. See above right. We need 640,

Unknown Speaker  25:43
cat quantities. What

Matthias Miller  25:46
so we're not showing how do you want the can't quantity displayed?

Speaker 1  25:49
Well, right now, what do we got here? We have 323, 20. We don't have that finished,

Unknown Speaker  26:04
right size,

Speaker 1  26:05
or can't quantity. Well, if it was finished, would it be in there?

Matthias Miller  26:09
Yeah, it would. So if we, if we, if we just go, Phil, I mean, it'd be worth the sake of example. All

Speaker 1  26:16
right, so three and a half by six. What are we talking about here? Three and a half, yep. So you're getting seven out of each one. Where's that, though? Again,

Matthias Miller  26:27
advanced configure can't sizes, um, so bottom left,

Speaker 1  26:35
bottom left. Yeah, I'm blocking it. Oh, there you go. Configure can sizes three and a half by 611,

Matthias Miller  26:46
16 by three and a

Matthias Miller  26:59
half. Yep, there you go.

Speaker 1  27:02
Oh, wait, say, wait a minute, I have to say that.

Matthias Miller  27:05
Oh, I'm sorry. You have to click on a get, to click on a different, not just row,

Unknown Speaker  27:12
but different group. Oh,

Speaker 1  27:16
there you go. Then save, okay, back to snap here, where we at? Let me see, right here.

Unknown Speaker  27:27
Oh, right here. So, yeah, it's

Speaker 1  27:30
can't quantity 26 Yeah. It's a little confused here, because the first row it's taking, yeah, 250 twos out of the 120 inch. Second one's thinking. 167 out of the 120 inch. So therefore the yields are different. So if we were to override, we would do your brewer schedule again? Okay, Brewer schedule showing currently. Now,

Matthias Miller  28:09
what I mean, everything's fine. You just can't see how many cans you need.

Speaker 1  28:12
Well, we So, yeah, some shows show the CANS

Unknown Speaker  28:18
right. There is where it should be, right before the

Matthias Miller  28:23
and how do you want that shown?

Speaker 1  28:25
Where's that 640 number coming from? That that's

Matthias Miller  28:28
the, that's the, it's the 352 minus. It's the 320 right here, 320

Speaker 1  28:35
and 320 total pieces. Yeah, which is what we need. That is the total pieces, um, if I change,

Speaker 1  28:49
like for for whatever reason here, we're only getting 152 out of this 10 footer, and the rest is going to whatever I right?

Matthias Miller  29:00
Because we, I mean, we are currently not looking at, and I don't know if we talked about this, did we talk about this at all, about looking at the most efficient combination to, I mean, we've, I don't remember what we talked about. I mean, we can. We're just doing a very dumb, how, how many times into 10 feet? We're not looking at everything on the order, using the same can't, you know, coming out to the right, to the right length is

Speaker 1  29:41
there? Like you're automatically deducting the length, which is 52 from the size, or can't length which is 120 is there a simple way, because we do combo cuts, is there a simple way for us to tell. This thing that we want, a 52 and a 67 out of that six, 120,

Matthias Miller  30:09
could we one way to do it? Would basically be, do you ever do it where you do, well, how complicated are the do the combo cuts get?

Speaker 1  30:28
Um, like we've done as many as we'll do as many as three different lengths.

Matthias Miller  30:34
But do you do two of two of one length? And, I mean, you might do two cuts of one length and a dirt cut of another, right?

Matthias Miller  30:51
I'm thinking so if you would do,

Matthias Miller  31:01
I mean, it's definitely doable. If you guys would spell out how you want the CANS cut, and these are the cuts we're going to use.

Speaker 1  31:11
Yeah, sorry, yeah. We can say like 240s and 136 then yes, that would be,

Matthias Miller  31:22
Do you want this?

Unknown Speaker  31:41
My brain's not right now, man,

Speaker 2  31:46
like right now? What raw material size or what raw material can't that's the most popular can't to do the job. And then whatever's in miscellaneous prep is, you mean exactly whether we cut three of one and one of another, two of one and one of another. But right now it's like, what we have in there is most popular raw material and most popular miscellaneous prep to cut that can't into is what. And then if I have to do anything like I said, if we don't have, say, 10 foot in the yarn, then I gotta do a goofy, whatever I mean with being especially cuts and stuff. It happens occasionally. So yeah, but right now, what's in the system, as far as the instructions, that's the most popular can't, to get it out of if you, if you follow along, yeah,

Matthias Miller  32:51
I got a few questions, and I'll get to my point in just a minute. So on the on the schedule, how exactly do you want the do you just want the can't quantity, space, and then the can't size. Is that how you want that shown?

Unknown Speaker  33:03
If we can, yeah, okay,

Matthias Miller  33:07
yeah, we can. The other option. So the simple option is saying, we're gonna, we're gonna, we're going to do combo cuts down the road, and in the short term, we're gonna let you override how many cans You need. Yeah, and then you just, you just do, like, in this case, so you're, you're getting, I mean, in this case, your total number can, should be 353 Well, 320 right? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  33:58
320 divided by seven. Well,

Matthias Miller  34:01
actually it's not going to be 320. It's going to be three. We're calculating cants based on the on the waste factor. Currently, 352,

Unknown Speaker  34:12
seven, right?

Matthias Miller  34:14
And in your item setup, you would say it's going to want to say that each of these get one. But in reality, you're going to give each of them, you know, half or something, or however you want to. Well, that's not quite right, but sorry, let me pull up the item definition. Sure I can justify this. I'm so here, so currently, the keynet quantity and so for each of these, you would just override the

Matthias Miller  34:59
so. I probably override the can't quantity on each of these. And instead of 14 cans, you say you need seven each, and it all adds up, and, and, and you're good. That's a short term solution.

Matthias Miller  35:34
The other way to do this.

Matthias Miller  35:42
Wait a minute.

Matthias Miller  36:02
I yeah, I mean, the other way to do it is to do combo cuts. Right. Spell out, if we do a combo cut, I

Matthias Miller  36:30
actually setting up combo cuts actually isn't that bad.

Matthias Miller  36:41
All right, I have to put some thought into it.

Matthias Miller  36:48
I guess here's the question. So

Speaker 1  36:53
well in this case, I would rather say, like I changed the missed prep to see above, but I would rather see it well,

Unknown Speaker  37:05
it's not going to work that way.

Speaker 1  37:08
But if we go to set, if I just send the 67 over, and it says in miscellaneous prep, cut 167 and 152 and then, because it's only going to get 167 out of that, like that's the wholeness length. So now, by deduction, there's 53 inches left. And because we said we also want a 52 out of that,

Unknown Speaker  37:41
it's automatically going to

Speaker 1  37:45
go to the it's saying, Oh, you also want a 52 why can give you a 52 I

Matthias Miller  37:52
don't know if that makes it, yeah, this is actually not that bad. I don't know why we couldn't just do automatic combo cuts, yeah, because you're only going to have three cuts. And so you're just looking for which variation up to three plus two plus 166, variations of what's the most efficient way to to do this. You run each of those scenarios, and then you find and then you find the scenario that requires the least cans. The only question then is, can you leave it to? Do you need to describe, I mean, but we could then, we could then provide a description for what that cut actually is, and we could put that in the grouping that says combo cut this like this length, this length and, or 1x this length, 2x that length, and, and just, I don't see any reason why it can't be automatic.

Unknown Speaker  39:00
You change requirement.

Matthias Miller  39:02
Yeah, ignore. I've got it open somewhere, and I'm not sure, yeah, it's good

Speaker 1  39:07
there. So I'm going to do something. I'm going to try just something here. So now I'm going to say,

Speaker 1  39:19
no, it's this guy. Now I'm going to go back to Brewer schedule. Now we're cutting the 60 sevens, and the counts are right, and the 52 is a Miller. Yeah. And anyway, Matt, like, I

Unknown Speaker  39:45
don't know if that helps at all.

Matthias Miller  39:53
Yeah. So I think I.

Matthias Miller  40:02
I'm sorry, what? Well, what did I miss?

Unknown Speaker  40:08
Yeah, I don't know. Okay, like for

Speaker 1  40:13
George, like his 493, quarters here the wave, 75 a job above that, if you can't get 249, three quarters out of an eight foot because they don't come eight foot four. I mean, they don't have to come eight foot four. So if he doesn't get the second 49 three quarters going to kick a 46 or run a 46 through half inch, whatever, is it, right?

Unknown Speaker  40:38
So by all

Speaker 1  40:41
Do you want this George to say twice as many camps thinking that? Like, do you want to double the can't count for that reason. Or do you want to run some through it and see how many you need after

Speaker 2  40:55
the fact? After the fact? Yeah, cool. If you do that, then you're going to get double. Say, we might say, Sorry, my

Speaker 1  41:02
eight. Sorry, I'm not trying to complicate it, but yeah, I have to skip out for an interview here. Oh, that's alright with you guys. I'll let you guys. I'm gonna look

Unknown Speaker  41:12
another room. Yeah? All right.

Matthias Miller  41:18
Um, yeah, I think, I think let me, let me take, let me take a quick minute to think through combo cuts. And if there's a simple way to handle combo cuts, then, like, I don't know why we would just, well, I guess I don't know

Unknown Speaker  41:39
there's a way. Then

Speaker 2  41:40
you say, you put that on the standard list, that when you go on that standard list with them all, you don't, not the standard list, but the

Matthias Miller  41:49
camp sizes, it'd be, it'd be on the well, and I guess here's, here's the question. In a lot of ways, the combo cuts makes the most sense only when you get to doing the printout, because your combo cut depends on what you're actually cutting, right. And so in my mind, having a process by which we take a look at, you know, at, at all of the items that you're cutting out of a can't and just do, just do some some cutting optimization on that and and see what the combo cuts need to be, and show that maybe in the grouping or something, the most efficient way to cut, cut, all of it, everything that's on, the list, and I don't know, let me, let me, let me.
