Matthias Miller  00:05
Text, Murph, I'm Here on Zoom. You

Matthias Miller  03:25
I'm also emailing it Over. I

Speaker 1  04:24
sorry, Matt, my bad on getting there quicker.

Matthias Miller  04:27
No worries. All right, I think the best thing probably would be if you want to log in and share your screen and I can walk you guys through.

Unknown Speaker  04:46
All right, log in here. Oh, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  05:09
Oh, not doing this, right? Good, Matt, we there yet. Yep, I

Unknown Speaker  05:36
what am I doing? Here we go.

Unknown Speaker  05:41
Should I hit share again?

Matthias Miller  05:42
Yeah, hit the share button.

Matthias Miller  05:54
All right, so if you go into this actually, let's go into go into advanced first. Let's start here and go into configure can sizes down at the bottom, there you go. All right, so here is the can dimensions, lumber dimensions and the lumber quantity per cant. I put zeros in here, so nothing's going to work until you actually put them in. But this is all the these are all the mappings in the system. Currently. Okay.

Speaker 1  06:45
Good. So that's, yeah, no, that's a good start. How do we? Well, I'll wait for you. Well,

Matthias Miller  06:51
I mean, you can, you can I made this, this be editable, so you can just click on a row, like, if we, I don't know. So you can, you can either go in here, or you can click on the lumber Quantity column

Unknown Speaker  07:06
right here. Okay, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  07:09
what if I go here?

Matthias Miller  07:12
So if you, if you need, if you need to change lumber dimensions or add dimensions, you have to click the can't dimensions link

Unknown Speaker  07:18
right here. Yep.

Matthias Miller  07:22
And then, and then you'd have to add a new lumber row. So this is it's grouped by, can't and so if you want to cut a different sized lumber out of a three and a half, a three and a half, you have to hit the plus row and put in the lumber size. And

Unknown Speaker  07:43
so can you say it one more time? If,

Matthias Miller  07:45
yeah, let's say you. Let's say you want to Yeah, if you want to cut another lumber size, then you would hit plus down at the bottom

Unknown Speaker  08:00
here. Yeah, okay, and

Matthias Miller  08:03
then, you know, you, you could do, got it? How are you, you know, fill that in and fill in the quantity. And you're good three and

Speaker 1  08:12
a half. But three and a half, what do we cut out of three and a half to three and a half? Ever? Nothing. I mean, I mean,

Matthias Miller  08:20
literally, everything is in here that you guys currently use. So,

Speaker 1  08:25
so you could be cutting a block, which would be 3.5 you'd just be cutting it to shorter. So that could happen on secondary. What's for secondary? Solid, well, we're not putting the the length here, what's dimensions? Yeah, right. Quantity. Oh, quantity out of the can. Okay, yeah, so this would be one, and this here would be 916, out of three. I'm not sure.

Matthias Miller  09:05
3.5 times 16 divided by nine is six? Does that sound right?

Unknown Speaker  09:14
Probably because of six inch we get eight.

Speaker 1  09:17
But a 916 to you, get right, eight out of a six, six out of a four. You probably only get five out of three. So I do five. So yeah, that makes sense, Matt. I think I'm I think I'm with you. So hit Save, save right there. Okay, okay, and then sorry, we, we might need

Matthias Miller  09:39
to fill in some more than specifically, so we can play around with the cut list generally. List generator, but that that's how the mapping works. Okay.

Speaker 1  09:50
So here's the dimensions. So if I change these numbers, that changes the three and a half by three and a half. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  09:57
I mean, most likely you. Don't want to do that, but Sure, but yes, it would then

Speaker 1  10:03
hit this button. Okay, so we just added that, you know,

Matthias Miller  10:11
and that should only be showing, I'll change this not to show decimals. You don't want decimals on here, but it'll, it'll round if you put in fractions or whatever. But anyway, well, do that as it may.

Unknown Speaker  10:23
And then the plus button here on the left,

Matthias Miller  10:28
if you're making changes and you don't want to make the if you change the zero to five and you don't want to, you can hover over the plus and hit discard changes.

Speaker 1  10:39
That's what to plus, that's it, so and so, how do we? How do I add a different can't dimension, besides what's in here?

Matthias Miller  10:48
Hit new detail screen in the we should really, I'm going to change the label on that button to make it clear. But, yeah, yep.

Unknown Speaker  10:57
Okay, yep. I

Matthias Miller  10:59
think you just put in the can't size,

Unknown Speaker  11:02
Okay, makes sense. So when you went back

Unknown Speaker  11:04
to go back to the other How do you get back? How do you get back into that right here? But the number of pieces click right on that.

Speaker 1  11:13
You can change. You say, I can change the pieces right here. Is that right? But if I want to change the dimensions, I have to go into the can't dimension and

Unknown Speaker  11:24
click on that right there.

Speaker 1  11:28
Like this one, change the dimensions. Yeah. Is there such a thing as, like, delete a size? Um, well, I guess if I would,

Matthias Miller  11:43
we don't really, well, we could. We could let you deactivate a size. Deleting a size is, I don't know, could potentially be problematic for

Unknown Speaker  11:55
not that it really matters is just a Yeah, that's not really going to be necessary.

Speaker 2  12:04
Now, the STD that that pertains just to the gang solves Matt

Matthias Miller  12:12
the on the report title, no, I got lazy and I didn't put in a but, I mean, that's not why the abbreviation, the abbreviation is it's short for standard. And I just didn't put in a report title, which I should have. But you are right. This only applies to the to the gang saws, and we'll get into that the cut list side, yeah.

Speaker 2  12:34
Because the reason why I'm asking that is because, like, a two by six, a two by six can, I don't have something like that. So that's why I'm questioning about anything I do. And a two by six is for one of the jobs I do, for The CNH, FN, the FN numbers. But I don't recall ever doing a two by six in a can't. So I'm not. That's why. I'm just puzzled. What that what that's recognizing.

Matthias Miller  13:05
Hang on, let me check something. So we are going to

Unknown Speaker  13:16
do size, and it's similar

Speaker 2  13:18
with the three and a half. Three and a half also, because I cut three and a half, three and a half out of a three and a half of eight, can't to get that three and a half, a three and a half. So that's another one that

Unknown Speaker  13:35
I'm not sure of.

Matthias Miller  13:38
Well, I'm not sure. Okay, let me, let me see where this guy comes from once. All right, so the two by six comes off tempco, which goes to the brewer. It's the tempco 39

Speaker 3  14:00
i All

Speaker 2  14:11
right, but it doesn't start out as an initial two by six. Can it probably? How am I explain it on this, I'd have to check that. What do you say? It was tempco,

Matthias Miller  14:26
tempco 39 I'd have to

Unknown Speaker  14:29
look at that, pull that print up and see, I mean,

Matthias Miller  14:33
that's what the raw material? That's the raw material we had in here. But, yeah,

Speaker 2  14:41
yeah, yeah, I'd have to, I'll investigate that a little bit more. See what. And then, like the three and a half. A three and a half, can you give me a number on that one too? Yeah,

Matthias Miller  14:56
by three and a half. That's aim, 21 i.

Unknown Speaker  15:00
Ame, yeah. Aim.

Speaker 2  15:03
Ame, 21 Yeah. How are you like, how are you identify, like, how are you doing that? Is that a way that I can

Matthias Miller  15:15
I could give you a way to we could give on the item. We could do a on the items report, I could give you a can't size filter that you could hunt down. Can't sizes, that'd be that'd be reasonable.

Unknown Speaker  15:35
Yeah, probably. I

Speaker 2  15:47
Well, the other ones like down below three and a half by sixes. They're pretty 387, 16, half inch, nine, six. I'm pretty well good with that. Now, if I don't, the question is, if I don't have lumber quantity, slash can. If I don't have any numbers in there, it's not going to generate anything to the cut list generator,

Unknown Speaker  16:09
sorry, on the on the which, if you're

Speaker 2  16:11
looking at the lumber quantity slash can, I mean it's, it's not going to be

Matthias Miller  16:16
able to calculate value. So you do need something in there if you wanted to show some kind of count. All right.

Matthias Miller  16:33
All right, just gonna go ahead put this in here and save it, and I'm gonna give it a quick try

Unknown Speaker  16:43
again. All right, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  16:47
three and a half by it's not working, right?

Unknown Speaker  16:55
This same is only standard

Unknown Speaker  17:16
Okay, well, is this

Speaker 2  17:17
standard on this page here. So

Matthias Miller  17:21
if you go into, okay, so now if you go into the sizers, cut list, well, actually, well, yeah, we can start here. So we've got the total pieces, inventory, pieces, pieces needed. If you scroll right, we got the size or waste percentage size or additional count. So the additional count would only be available on scalpy.

Matthias Miller  17:55
And then you have the size or pieces, which is 770 and then we don't have a size or the quantity for can't. But if we, if we would go into the three and a half by six, where we just were, and fill in the seven and a half by three and a half on that, Then we could have it calculate the can't quantity. I

Unknown Speaker  18:43
so we're not able to get to that standard. Go

Matthias Miller  18:45
back to the advanced, that advanced tab at the top, there's home, and then there's advanced. And go down to configure can't sizes. And then it's the 716 by

Unknown Speaker  19:11
so that's just one can. It's not the whole can.

Matthias Miller  19:17
Yeah, how many? How many 716 by three and a half. Can you get out of a three and a half by six and 10? So let's just drop 10 in there. And then, for now, you need to hit the save button top right, and I'm going to make it top drop right, and I'm going to make it work like the cut list. Then just get off the road to save it, but for now, hit the saves, Changes button. All right. So now, if we go back to the sizer cut list, I'm.

Matthias Miller  20:04
If you scroll over or, yeah, I mean, you can, you can see, you can see some of the info here. I was thinking, if you go back over to, if you scroll right column,

Unknown Speaker  20:21
do I have to go back to home again. Uh,

Matthias Miller  20:26
just, we're the hat, either way this or the back button, yeah. So scroll right this top row here, then you'll see so sizer pieces is set 770, sizer quantity per can that rounds out perfectly. So we need 77 can't, can't. And then the size we should put this the can't size further left. If there are multiple sizes that you can cut this thing out of then you can choose a different can size.

Unknown Speaker  21:09
Yeah, actually, Matt, if you do 77 that's

Speaker 2  21:20
77 three and a half by six by whatever we're cutting.

Matthias Miller  21:28
That's all my links. Oh, my,

Speaker 2  21:32
sorry. Sorry, that would give me, like, three times as much, right? Three and a half, 610s

Matthias Miller  21:40
so let me see if I got this right on the item itself, I might have, but let me check, alright. So that quantity, yeah, 716, by

Speaker 4  21:53
three times as much as well. That's a point seven. I mean, that's a 40, right? 40. Yeah, that's

Matthias Miller  22:01
my bad. Um, all right, so the can't quantity here times

Unknown Speaker  22:10
the so I'm not sure. Wait,

Matthias Miller  22:25
what am I missing? This

Unknown Speaker  22:28
is the showing

Unknown Speaker  22:30
plus nine. That's what,

Speaker 5  22:35
yeah, 5857 Yeah.

Matthias Miller  22:48
Thickness with thickness size. All right, so let's go to the can't size. I'm missing something here. So on the three and a half by six, we have,

Matthias Miller  23:15
oh, I have not filled this in, right? So I put the put the wrong thing in. Alright, so the quantity should be 30, which I am,

Unknown Speaker  23:31
size or can't quantity,

Matthias Miller  23:34
right? Okay, it's, it's showing up right on the item, but it's not showing right on this cut list. So

Unknown Speaker  23:43
that's my that's a fairly embarrassing problem, but fix it.

Matthias Miller  24:00
There should be, it should be a third. So you should, you should have, it should be 3797 70, divided by 30, it should be 26 Right, right.

Unknown Speaker  24:10
Yeah. I

Unknown Speaker  24:26
I'm sure, lovely

Speaker 5  24:52
anyway, yeah, so. Okay, I'm just

Matthias Miller  25:22
going to do gonna do a quick check here to Make sure

Matthias Miller  25:35
that's not right either. Yes, it is. I'm

Unknown Speaker  25:45
this

Unknown Speaker  25:59
is this connection needs to go.

Matthias Miller  26:07
All right, I'm going to need to push an update to get that to come across, but that'll come through the next update.

Matthias Miller  26:19
So then, if you add this to the schedule, we can then take a look at how it shows up on the on the schedule. For you, I

Matthias Miller  26:48
do you have more questions on Yeah, more questions on how this works. Do do you want to be able to change the poplar or oak part of the raw material info here? George,

Speaker 2  27:14
yeah, I'm gonna have to. Because if I don't say, just an example, if I don't have three and a half, 610, poplar or oak in the yard, I'm going to have to do something else to accommodate that 40 inch board, all right,

Matthias Miller  27:27
so let me Yes, fair enough. And are you also going to need to change the length on that? Potentially? Potentially? Yeah, okay, so I will, let's see.

Matthias Miller  27:59
One question I had, you guys had two different have two different formats for the length. There's some times when you did like you'll see here at the top, three foot, four inches, and there are other times when you did 40 inches. Do you guys have a preference how that gets done? So we could, we could always do inches. We could always split it. We could say, if it's an even feet, throw it, show it three feet, and if it's an odd feet, show it in inches. How do you guys want that working? We can do

Speaker 2  28:32
it. My preference will be inches, if we can, because it, I mean, it doesn't bother me, but it's going to be a little rough for the guys on the floor, I think, yeah,

Speaker 1  28:43
all of our prints matter in inches on dimensions. The dimensions of it, like all three dimensions, is always in inches. All right, good, yeah. And then CANS is where the feet comes in.

Matthias Miller  28:58
So in the CANS you want, you want them coming in as feet. But on the lumber, you want inches

Unknown Speaker  29:04
Correct, yeah,

Matthias Miller  29:07
and and then on cans, if it is a like 12 foot two inch, or something like that, you want it as 12 foot two inch,

Unknown Speaker  29:13
yeah. Okay.

Speaker 2  29:20
Now the size, waste factor, Matt, waste percentage I can change out. Also say that to 15%

Matthias Miller  29:29
Yeah, you can set that on the item so that it it's that way going forward. Or you can change it right here. If you change it right here, it should drop, drop. You know, go up to, like, 805 pieces or whatever right

Speaker 2  29:43
now. Say, if I do change to 15% here now, when I go, say, I do this order 15% like when I come back to it, say, in two weeks, I got the same job. Is it going to relate back to 10% Yeah. All right, it always goes back to the original,

Matthias Miller  30:03
whatever you've got set on the item, yeah. All right.

Unknown Speaker  30:13
All right. I

Unknown Speaker  30:24
Good.

Matthias Miller  30:29
All right, so you're gonna make those, those small changes, if you so we can, we can do one or two things. We can go down to scalpy. It's really not any different. Besides, you can fill in the additional count instead of the base percentage, or or we can add this one to the schedule and take a look at the brewer schedule. I don't really care which way you go. Your choice. George,

Unknown Speaker  30:59
well, these are they all?

Unknown Speaker  31:07
So this page is all Brewer,

Matthias Miller  31:11
this part of the pages.

Unknown Speaker  31:13
And then if you go to Keystone schedule,

Matthias Miller  31:16
is the keystone printout. If you go further down, you go back and go further down the list. You get down to down to the others. Yeah, all right, like there's Keystone. I

Unknown Speaker  31:47
where you want to

Unknown Speaker  31:49
go. Just want to get out and

Unknown Speaker  31:51
what the hang?

Speaker 2  31:55
What? Scroll down to scalpy laptop, two fingers.

Unknown Speaker  32:12
Yeah, if

Matthias Miller  32:20
you click on one of these rows, you can put in an additional count. I guess, I guess. Here's another question. Do you want? Do you want the additional count to default to 100 and all scalpy orders,

Speaker 2  32:35
those times that scalpy I cut 100 extra what? It doesn't matter what it is there.

Unknown Speaker  32:40
Okay, well, let me, let me here, let me

Unknown Speaker  32:48
do this.

Speaker 1  32:51
Does that happen on this page? Matt where, like, if he wants to make it 200 he needs to go right here. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  32:57
okay, yep. So just put in 200 here.

Unknown Speaker  33:05
Changes have been saved, okay?

Unknown Speaker  33:10
And if you scroll right, it should show 1856,

Speaker 1  33:16
sort order you can do here, inventory,

Unknown Speaker  33:21
yep. 1856,

Speaker 2  33:24
so say, on that first one, Matt, I want to change that. You scroll back to the left, yep, if I want to take that first job. 716, three and a half, three foot 10 Scout, say, Scapy just called me. Said they broke down, so they're not going to be able to cut it. So transfer that that specific job, say, to the keys or the Keystone or the brewer. What do I do to get that from that? It's

Matthias Miller  33:55
roll right and select the Change the size or to

Speaker 4  34:02
change it there, yeah, all right, that'll send it to the brewer or the keys. Got it, okay.

Unknown Speaker  34:14
Still there, okay.

Speaker 2  34:18
And then schedule if that means once I click on the No,

Matthias Miller  34:24
yeah, you can either check the box, or you can click the Add To Schedule button and

Speaker 2  34:28
then that transfers it to the keyston schedule, or the brew or the scalp feed.

Matthias Miller  34:34
Well, oh, I'm sorry if you change it, you just leave the row and refresh it'll be up in that section, and you can do whatever you need to with it. But for print out, if you want to do a printout, either check the box and leave the row, or click the Add To Schedule button to put it onto onto a printout, and then leave, leave the row first you. I click, click, click on, like scalpy hollow or different row, or, yeah, sure, and then click the scalpy Hollow schedule top right. And then, oh, the quantity is wrong,

Unknown Speaker  35:24
right? Oh, the top,

Matthias Miller  35:25
it's the top one's wrong,

Speaker 1  35:30
yeah? Well, that doesn't necessarily have to be there, though, Matt, or do you want? That doesn't have to be showing on this page, like the 1656, well, yeah, I get it. That's what. Well,

Speaker 2  35:46
I wouldn't have to put it in what? That's what I'm typing into the brewer and the Keystone. What's that? Miscellaneous prep? Yeah, I'm putting a maximum and a minimum. The maximum is the percentage of waste, and the minimum would be that 1656, but for scalpy, definitely not, because that's going to that would be only pertaining to the Keystone and the brewer.

Matthias Miller  36:12
So you find, if we just just group it by the miscellaneous prep, put all the oak together and leave the quantity out, that's

Unknown Speaker  36:19
what you want, right? Okay,

Speaker 2  36:23
in total for scalpy, but now, like I said, with Keystone and Brewer, I always do a maximum. I put the maximum count in the miscellaneous prep column, and I'm gonna always have the You mean the minimum, right?

Speaker 2  36:49
Which stinks because we're not always pulling we're not always pulling at all the bad stuff out. We're trying to get as much as we can. So here lately, we've been trying to stay with as close to the maximum as we can, because of production, thrown more away.

Unknown Speaker  37:10
All right,

Unknown Speaker  37:14
so sorry, I wasn't listening to the last I'm sorry. So what'd you say?

Speaker 2  37:20
Like the max and the men, they stay close to the men, yes, and then say, Melvin and pull all the stuff out. So now we're getting below. So now we don't have enough stuff, so we try and stay as close to the maximum. Now with Keystone, yeah, got these like minimal races, right? Half percent,

Unknown Speaker  37:41
maybe we have that.

Speaker 1  37:43
Now, with that being said, Does Mel and Joel and dill and Harvey need to know the the men?

Speaker 2  37:52
That's what they do. We do that now I know they got the men. I know, I know, but if they didn't know the men, would it? How would that really affect when they're not to say what those right,

Unknown Speaker  38:05
but you kind of want them to do that anyway, for

Speaker 4  38:09
a certain extent. I wonder if, I wonder if stringer is a little different. I wonder if we should consider

Speaker 1  38:15
that in the future, maybe just getting rid of them in just do the maths.

Unknown Speaker  38:25
If you want

Matthias Miller  38:28
to go back, you can add that Brewer one to the to the schedule, sit the Back button, hit the brewer one to the schedule. And then we can take a look at the brewer cut list too,

Unknown Speaker  38:40
right here. Yeah, oops.

Unknown Speaker  38:47
Changes require you see that.

Matthias Miller  38:50
Yeah, click that. I have it open somewhere. Just ignore all warnings. No. Click the check. You can check the box again and just ignore all warnings. Okay, yep, and then leave the row again, yep, and then click Brewer, schedule. It just wants to make sure you're not being rude to me. Um, wait, what is up with that? Oh, I'm not using the image. I did not test this deeply enough. I'm not using the inventory counts calculate the waste, but

Speaker 5  39:29
yeah, you get the idea. Yeah, it's good. I

Unknown Speaker  40:04
You like this with the item number and then customer name, or would you rather have it

Speaker 4  40:13
very so put the item number, especially just the customer, unless we're shipping right. It's yeah, it's just for a lot of them.

Speaker 2  40:28
Because the problem is, see, we have a valve five and a valve six, it takes 40 inch I don't keep them themselves. I I know. I want to ask them that too. So if I have multiple sides, like, high seal. If I have three, two and a half, three and a half, 119, add them all together, which it might be high, I serve four. High, serve 2.5 and I serve three. But if I delete the other two, like, right now, I'll put all three cells in one. So it might be high serve 2.53

Speaker 4  41:07
or four. So that item number is showing that it's just one high serve number, but it's going to be for three different sizes, the highest steel, yeah, which they don't mark a high certain but

Unknown Speaker  41:24
in the future might be,

Unknown Speaker  41:27
would be helpful? Could be helpful.

Speaker 2  41:29
I can leave it. It's just making more. Yeah, I know it's making a cut list, right? And then he called me, Hey, George is assault the same. The thing is, anytime it's going to affect anything, as of T I you know, man, if he's doing on opposite teams, you know, man, two different teams, right? Three different teams. Got everything stacked, yeah, one power, yeah. That could cause, if you know that it's for two different items, it would be helpful. But, yeah, but if I especially Yeah, feel that happen. I mean, if I feel that that's going to happen. Then I just keep them. Or if I feel that I need to have that item number, just for a reference, I usually design for

Speaker 1  42:07
me. Well, I guess if it'd be Val five, mile six, I'd like to see the pack mark, Val five, comma, six, or about five and six. And then when he brings it in, they do five

Speaker 2  42:21
first or six. See, the thing is, it's going to be with the calculations and stuff. If I do that. Is that going to mess that up

Speaker 1  42:29
if I put So Matt, if there's two same sizes

Unknown Speaker  42:34
out of

Speaker 1  42:37
same size board, same species? Um, regardless

Speaker 1  42:45
of customer name, Item ID, like, can we combine? How will this? How currently does this combine? Can this is this set up to combine two different orders if they're if all the parameters of size and species match

Matthias Miller  43:03
correct. And if, if you have, if you get 1000 let's say you do 1000 at 10% waste, and 1000 at 15% waste, it'll show 12 and a half percent waste, because that's the that's the overall waste.

Unknown Speaker  43:19
Yeah, sure.

Speaker 1  43:25
How does it combine then? Well, like, in other words, how will that show up on the size or schedule? Like this page, if it's combining two,

Matthias Miller  43:37
let me see if I can pull up an example for you. I um, well, that would be one that's on the same order. We gotta find, you gotta find ones that would be same.

Speaker 1  43:49
I serve is a good one, right? Yeah, the 119 uh, well, here's another 16th, three and a half.

Matthias Miller  43:58
But you want ones. I mean, if you really want to show this. You want ones that are the same size from different customers,

Speaker 1  44:07
which might be low, rough, but this year could be,

Speaker 4  44:13
I mean, this would give us a good start right here. I

Unknown Speaker  44:24
This is not what am I missing here? All right,

Unknown Speaker  44:33
yes, yes,

Speaker 2  44:38
so that would be as far as your sort order. You would put the same sort order number, and that would come combo. It would

Unknown Speaker  44:46
combine. There it

Matthias Miller  44:50
is. It'll automatically combine. All right?

Speaker 1  44:53
I like this, right? Because then, you know, it's for two jobs, and the guys on the floor know Mel. Can market if I serve 2.5 and seven.

Unknown Speaker  45:07
Okay, you're back to that. Now,

Unknown Speaker  45:16
post my question

Speaker 2  45:19
like you had that on there. Merv, that one you just had on there. Now, in the order you want to put it on that cut list. Matt, how refresh my memory on that? Yeah.

Matthias Miller  45:31
So if you want to move it to the top of the cut list, you put in a sort order. And so, and you, you can it's, it can be any number you want, but let's say you want to do, let's say you want to do high serve first well then put put one. You can put one in both of the sort orders, like put one in the first high serve, but one of the second high serve. And then it'll group them, group the ones together. And if you pull up the brewer schedule now you

Unknown Speaker  46:03
Val four for fun, but

Matthias Miller  46:04
yeah, well, I guess this is, I guess you could change the Val five to zero, sure, right? Is this the right order? Though? Yeah, the right it is.

Unknown Speaker  46:18
Yeah, it is. I

Matthias Miller  46:23
I mean, but are we?

Matthias Miller  46:29
No, but are we wanting to sort these by size?

Speaker 2  46:37
I would rather do it by, you know me, I didn't usually pull them together as what needs to be cut for production. Okay? So,

Matthias Miller  46:47
so it doesn't really matter beyond the sorter or what order they show up in, right? Okay, bye. Well,

Speaker 1  46:53
don't you want sizes grouped together, though, if, if you're sending them to the schedule you you do want the sizes grouped

Unknown Speaker  47:07
here, when you say group together?

Speaker 1  47:09
Well, like right here, you'll have all your two Nappa three and a half will be half one after the other. Everything that you send over will be grouped here. And if you need to ungroup those or change the order, you'll have to do it in the sort order

Unknown Speaker  47:35
back

Unknown Speaker  47:41
you do click, another

Unknown Speaker  47:44
two and a half. There's another two and a half.

Unknown Speaker  47:48
I have put a number one with that until

Unknown Speaker  47:55
see what. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  47:58
yeah, this isn't actually. I now, this printout is just a tad too complicated for good. We are not properly.

Unknown Speaker  48:19
Let's do this.

Speaker 4  48:22
So there it was, doing a shorter size first, yeah.

Speaker 1  48:27
I mean it's working. I think it's working the way we need it to work. Matt,

Unknown Speaker  48:31
as far as

Matthias Miller  48:33
it was the source, the source not actually working the way you think It is.

Unknown Speaker  48:36
No, yeah. I

Unknown Speaker  48:57
I don't think so. I

Unknown Speaker  49:21
This Is the

Matthias Miller  49:41
I'm gonna have to, yeah, I don't, I don't. I here. Let me, let me. Let me. Make a note of this.

Speaker 2  49:49
What are you seeing, Matt, that I'm not following you about what are you seeing.

Matthias Miller  49:55
These are sorted by number by i. By 252, 462, 800 and they're not sorted by sorter.

Unknown Speaker  50:06
Oh, really, yeah, I'm pretty sure.

Matthias Miller  50:19
And I, I think, I think we're gonna have to, I'm gonna have to, on our end, we're gonna have to figure out a way to simplify this report, because it's, it's, it's, anyway, I'll take a look at it. But

Unknown Speaker  50:32
look here.

Speaker 1  50:35
So you're saying if I put a two here on another item, it would not go to the top right.

Unknown Speaker  50:42
Let's try it. Oh, shoot.

Unknown Speaker  50:52
Why would it go to the top? It should go into the ones, right?

Unknown Speaker  50:59
It should go after the ones, yeah, let's see what

Unknown Speaker  51:07
it's Go

Unknown Speaker  51:10
see it's f.

Unknown Speaker  51:18
So it's following, one, two. I to

Unknown Speaker  51:25
wait.

Unknown Speaker  51:27
Is that because that's the same size

Unknown Speaker  51:31
anyway? Yeah, it is okay.

Unknown Speaker  51:33
You know what you're doing, Matt, wait, yeah, yeah, all right. Shall I label this go.

Unknown Speaker  51:41
It's just, yeah,

Matthias Miller  51:42
I think, I think it's, I know what I need to do here. So besides those few little fixes and tweaks,

Matthias Miller  51:56
every, every time we're like this close to like, pulling the trigger. But is that alright? Well, how about we do this? How about when's when's the next chance that you guys have to take a look at, at at it, once we get these things,

Unknown Speaker  52:15
how soon you want to?

Matthias Miller  52:17
I could do as early as this afternoon? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  52:19
we could, right? I think so

Matthias Miller  52:24
two would probably be good for me. Two Eastern,

Unknown Speaker  52:27
two o'clock, yeah,

Speaker 4  52:33
alright. Two

Speaker 1  52:38
230 No. 215 would be better.

Matthias Miller  52:41
Okay, 215 that's that's perfect for me. Um, okay, alright, alright, I'll send out invite see you guys at 215 I'll shoot you a text or shoot anything change. Yep, thanks guys.

Unknown Speaker  52:54
Thank you. Max, yeah, yeah.
