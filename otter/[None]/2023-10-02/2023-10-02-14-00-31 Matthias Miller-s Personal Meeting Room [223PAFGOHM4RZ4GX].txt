Unknown Speaker  00:52
Good day, guys. Hello. And I'm gonna drop in 45 minutes

Matthias Miller  01:08
they will ask what you're going to drop? The mean, I've seen 30 pounds in 30 days I've seen.

Unknown Speaker  01:14
I try not try not to lose weight.

Unknown Speaker  01:20
I don't have to try

Matthias Miller  01:30
man. Okay. So a little bit of an update from Mark Mark has been absolutely delighted with the level of progress we've made since the last 20 the 30th deadline. So I think we I mean, we still have our work cut out from us. It's like from one white knuckle deadline to the next. Yeah. I am. So one of the things that we uncovered is a whole host of this doesn't quite work the way that we think it should work or like, I don't know. Stripe messiness. Yeah, we'll just go issue refunds and split line items and not really care about what happens and oh, by the way our to payments, we get received premiums on those payments on a monthly basis during the life of the of the RTO contract. And then there's financing and I don't know, miscellaneous things like that. And sales order, write off discrepancy write offs? And I'm not sure. So there's a good bit of stuff that Dwayne and Mark need to get their heads together on and figure out and Dwayne just got back from the ship Expo and is currently swimming and

Unknown Speaker  02:55
everything's on the way.

Matthias Miller  02:57
Well, probably that I think this is this first pick. But so that's kind of that's where that's at. I mean, we can

Matthias Miller  03:18
some of this stuff needs to be cleaned up, but it's sort of pushing a whole bunch of stuff over into here. We're making a few payroll tweaks yet. PTO? PTO changes?

Matthias Miller  03:35
Gonna be adding payroll deductions after a bit distinguishing between anticipated and anticipated payroll items, etc. But I don't know that that's. I mean, yeah. Mark, and Mark and I are going to be meeting on Wednesday. And I'm gonna guess doing it's gonna be on there. And we're going to be figuring out what I think next reasonable deadline is their priorities at the end of the month, and see what we think we can get knocked out by then. So good bit of stuff that's in Drew's court for testing. This appears to have been included in his review. I think we might have looked over that last time.

Matthias Miller  04:32
We've got your handle, create a payroll export, to export payroll from QuickBooks, and then we need to handle tax values coming back in from QuickBooks based on what the actual taxation was on the pay. To leave talked about but not really dug into that further, check printing is going to be processed so we need to spec out

Speaker 1  04:57
sorry you can't use in QuickBooks is as temporary is As long term is QuickBooks only for payroll,

Matthias Miller  05:03
QuickBooks will be only, I believe, only for payroll. Got it?

Speaker 1  05:07
And just using that, because it's cheaper than getting a payroll service?

Matthias Miller  05:13
I don't know. I think probably because they're already using it. Fair? Should we look at switching to something like? I mean, there's gussto. And there's paychecks. And there's,

Speaker 1  05:31
I don't know. And those, those are going to be fairly pricey. For Are you keeping absolutely everything else out of QuickBooks? Long term, I can just tell you, we've been with Hoover financial done some consulting. And he hates parallel accounting systems. And it's against it quite strongly. He's run into it a fair bit. You know, Shadow books and stuff like that. So if the only thing that we're pushing into quicker using QuickBooks for is, is payroll, I think that's fine. If you, in essence, have all your data over there. The risks of getting stuff out of sync on taxes and things is high.

Matthias Miller  06:32
Money is a long term play. My understanding had been they were only intending to use it for payroll. But

Speaker 1  06:42
I mean, the simplest thing is if you just don't take anything, you just make sure that it is it is basically a new file, payroll only file. And I'm less worried about the transition period than long term. It's just inviting abusive if we if you if we run two parallel sets of books long term.

Speaker 2  07:02
Yeah. I mean, I do. I do know that Hoover mentioned gussto is one that he said, It seems like tech people really like partly because of the apparently pretty good accounting, API access

Matthias Miller  07:32
depends a lot on what plan you can get on with them. You're looking at 40 to 80 bucks employee per, per month times. I don't know if they care.

Unknown Speaker  07:47
40 to 80.

Matthias Miller  07:53
I'm sorry, nevermind. I'm gonna looking at the red numbers and not that I can't do math. to base it six or 12 each. Next time, we'll try to do math and reading. Reading

Unknown Speaker  08:12
okay.

Speaker 1  08:20
Okay, you need the 12. If you go multistate, which they would. And I mean, I don't know if it's prohibitive for them or not, but it's a more anyway. So more elegant solution.

Matthias Miller  08:45
Well, do you care enough about it to at least make a pitch to them? I mean, what's the what's the advantage for us to make a pitch in the short term for that?

Speaker 1  08:56
I'm not sure there's any advantage? Well, as long as you're handling everything with QuickBooks, I don't know that there's any advantage or is this QuickBooks Desktop?

Matthias Miller  09:09
I believe so. Andres computer not sure it's gonna be okay. Sure. Whitney's computer, Whitney.

Unknown Speaker  09:25
Whitney was taking along with us she's wrong.

Speaker 3  09:37
euphemism for they're they're firing her or what? Yes. I think that's the long long term plan. I didn't think I could

Speaker 1  09:47
be okay. Okay, I mean, I don't think at the bigger scheme of things. It's something to I mean, as long as you're taking care of it with us like I close by eyes. I don't think it's I don't think it's I don't think it's dreadful. I mean,

Matthias Miller  10:07
yeah I mean, you could do nifty things like one click payroll and Josh could go right integration for gusto since we like having him right integrations

Speaker 1  10:31
but I mean, there's a, they may well have 100 employees across the whole thing, don't they?

Speaker 2  10:39
They're using QuickBooks. I mean, so are they using QuickBooks payroll module? Yeah. I mean, that's not free. Oh, it isn't. No.

Speaker 1  10:55
$6 Okay. So we're talking about maybe doubling anyway fine. Plus the anyway okay, fine

Speaker 1  11:12
yeah, I doubt it's something to push through and to before this before January 1, but it may be worth exploring a bit. Anyway, let's keep driving. It's not a critical piece.

Matthias Miller  11:35
We can always do this sure

Matthias Miller  11:46
eventually,

Speaker 1  11:48
if we still if we're still South next summer, we can have them figured out why that's so slow

Matthias Miller  11:58
I can't even change the

Matthias Miller  12:08
that's just painful. We're gonna change it. Okay, so

Unknown Speaker  12:16
Oh, yep. Cash Flow I'm behind

Unknown Speaker  12:27
not sure what percentage to say but

Unknown Speaker  12:35
call it 60. somewhere between half a day and two remaining.

Speaker 1  12:42
Should this be bumped up to ready to code? I mean, you are coding it? Yeah. But it is strictly J I know CCI. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  12:58
You've got a change request for this somewhere. Should be oops. Core

Speaker 2  13:11
one question on that. Would would they find it helpful? And would it be valuable for us if they could actually see the In Progress thing with the strong caveat that it is in progress or should it just show up in its complete form?

Matthias Miller  13:46
I mean, I think bottom line is I still don't see how cash flows is useful until we've got accounting data. So yeah, I think by September 30 But what's the point? Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  14:03
So are they starting to enter data for from October now?

Matthias Miller  14:09
They've been working on July is kind of a as a got it

Unknown Speaker  14:15
yeah

Unknown Speaker  14:20
okay

Unknown Speaker  14:25
we could take off the August 21 That's clearly not true

Matthias Miller  14:36
Hey, are this stuff is I just need to break out and other other stuff right. Get rid of some of the sub points but didn't get rid of that one just lingering there. We need a receive payments process. This is all under stuff that we were hoping to get done by September 30 But didn't and also receive deposits process and And Are ya make deposit process? So?

Matthias Miller  15:08
And here are some of the notes and the payroll tax integration they had

Matthias Miller  15:23
so that's all in still in my court

Matthias Miller  15:35
the it's still still pending. This is non urgent future. Do we want to get to regression testing for accounting impact to the blue sky need some definition but

Matthias Miller  15:59
if you want any regressions

Speaker 3  16:06
more we're doing this minute now. But isn't that totally a q4 kind of thing.

Matthias Miller  16:11
It's actually probably more like a cue for nice maybe sort of find

Matthias Miller  16:26
me we can go live without this validation just needs to be done. I don't know how we should prioritize it. We can also be likely to get this done. We just need to prioritize it. 1099 requirements

Matthias Miller  16:45
that needs to now we're getting into stuff that isn't particularly isn't specifically scheduled. So I kind of think we're out into very undefined territory.

Unknown Speaker  17:02
So

Speaker 3  17:04
next month look like Is it is it all in to a still needs design? Or? Like, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  17:11
I was wondering to

Matthias Miller  17:12
most of next month is into a I would say.

Speaker 1  17:15
So payroll export, should we start labeling pieces as payroll export? Mm, only?

Matthias Miller  17:22
Yes.

Speaker 1  17:31
Okay, receive payments. I mean, or anything that's blank. Is anything blank? Just mean, Matthias?

Matthias Miller  17:42
I mean, it's currently my quarter. That's the question. Yeah, sure. Sure, that's fair.

Unknown Speaker  17:55
How soon? Are you wanting check printing?

Matthias Miller  17:59
Well, in my mind, I think this is I don't know that this this needs to happen this month, in my opinion. Okay. Getting data in the system so that we can reconcile actual numbers seems to me like yeah, numero uno.

Unknown Speaker  18:19
So are any of these things that they need to get data into the system?

Matthias Miller  18:24
Yes, receive payments would be nice to have a deposit Well, the payment deposit process, cleaning up all the payment stuff, figuring out the financing and the RTO premiums, premiums added a good bit of that stuff is waiting on them to do the business process. So things got it. Payroll accounting module impact, I mean, I think all of this pretty much all of this stuff is super Cheque Printing is is required for that.

Unknown Speaker  18:56
So

Speaker 1  19:02
So Joel drives the head on cash flow, we relax just a tiny bit because you can't even run it because you don't have the data for it. And we have better sections on income statements that we can drive ahead. And the what's currently nice to have by September 30, what is the new category for to be? Is that must have by November 15, or nice to have by February 1 Or what is it?

Matthias Miller  19:37
We talked to I mean, it could have been like, Mark and I should this seems to me like the kind of thing that we need to talk through with I should talk through with Marshall Wednesday and Yep,

Unknown Speaker  19:47
perfect. Let's look at look at the Okay, so we'll look around next week for that then. Is there anything that you want from Josh or is

Matthias Miller  19:57
stripe refunds? Okay.

Speaker 3  20:01
So what are you waiting on stripe refunds, like just a feed coming into the system?

Matthias Miller  20:07
Well, we need to do either one of two ways either a link from a payment to say I want to go issue a refund for this particular payment and have it record on the sales order. Or we need to have a feat of refunds coming into the system and then the ability to attach those and have an alert so that we can attach them to the appropriate sales order.

Speaker 3  20:38
Okay, should I be talking to work through workflow through with you, Dwayne Mark, who cares?

Matthias Miller  20:46
Dwayne's the one who cares the most Dwayne and Leanne vn might execute more than Dwayne. I think we might be okay with a happens rarely enough, we might also just be okay with a an X 32. I don't know you put in a payment ID and you were I don't know. I regardless, we're gonna want we're gonna want them fed into the system. I don't see any way where we don't want that. And then once we have them in the system, we can decide well, do we want to just have a process by which you can attach and attached stripe items to a sales order? Then that might be good enough?

Speaker 3  21:36
Well, if there's a refund, we'll know what the payment is associated with. Right? So we know what sales like what sales are

Matthias Miller  21:41
next year? Oh, yeah. And if we could field with there is a possibility that we'll we'll need a mechanism to move stripe payments from one sales order to another. And if we do that, it would be really nice. If we don't do that we have to do this. Okay, it'd be nice to feel the source source ID, which I'm assuming you would do anyway. So it could be as simple as Yeah. I think the question for Dwayne is does he want a limited access tool for his AR people to be able to issue refunds without going into the master Stripe account?

Speaker 3  22:34
Yeah, and that that's not a question of do we do it one way or another? That's the question that we've done it Do you want to do additional work? Perfect.

Matthias Miller  22:42
So if you just want to do it with no additional work just go put them into the system and attach them to the right sales order.

Speaker 1  22:57
Do that and the list says crisis Matthias doesn't.

Unknown Speaker  23:18
know but

Speaker 1  23:26
I can't do Josh CFP or is he as ACH me? I think

Matthias Miller  23:36
it really is not. Okay,

Speaker 3  23:42
do you want it? Like, I truly don't ever look at this.

Matthias Miller  23:47
You only look at it. You're just gonna do it by next week anyway, won't you? Yeah. Thank you. That's what I thought

Unknown Speaker  23:58
you want from Josh?

Matthias Miller  24:00
Yes, this report is absolutely driving me bonkers. I don't understand. We were straight payout where the amount was $2,000. We have source payment of 2591 on it. And I just can't figure out

Matthias Miller  24:22
what's going on? Here's 167 10 What is this? 167 10. It was sales orders are mismatched on this one. Here's a stripe payout of a refund with a line item for 16 grand.

Unknown Speaker  24:44
Can you just send me links to a couple of these

Matthias Miller  25:02
See if there's any other I think there's a refund refund. Here's another non refund 170 806. Seven, it's clearly past 70 100.

Matthias Miller  25:27
Oops. Oops. All right, this is probably about getting to be too many. But that should give you nice sample size. 399.

Speaker 1  25:46
So the only thing you're needing from judge from code crafters this week is, well, I mean, keep working on cash flows. But if we get that done, you're giddy, but otherwise, I mean, it's not I mean, doesn't sound like it's really time. Critical. I mean, it that one's not the most critical piece. And otherwise, we're waiting until we hear from you all and Mark about what the board has bubbled to the top. Yep. What are you needing to keep? So it feels like, like, insight and you are totally under the gun at this point. What are you? Is there anything we can do or provide for you to keep driving forward? Or, or shrug and say, well, it's going smashingly and we just keep plunging ahead.

Matthias Miller  27:05
I don't know.

Unknown Speaker  27:25
I mean, I'm happy if you're happy.

Matthias Miller  27:28
I mean, I'm fine. Just continuing to drive ahead. I can't think of anything really immediately obvious. Yep. feels to me like, we're in this. Like, there isn't. At this point, the bottleneck is between my design and their business requirements. I mean, you somebody could be working. Josh could be working on sales tax potentially, if we had that. Well, do we need that? I don't know. Maybe that's not even a thing we need right away. Sales tax liability calculations, for example. There's no core counting stuff

Matthias Miller  28:14
even 1099 handling isn't really core counting.

Unknown Speaker  28:19
Okay, I mean, I'm sounds fine.

Matthias Miller  28:24
You guys could could this I could spec this for you guys to kid. Sure. I don't think there's much

Speaker 1  28:36
right. Okay. Can I drop?

Matthias Miller  28:43
I'm good. Good.

Speaker 2  28:45
Thank you. Sounds Yeah, it's no need for me there. Is that right?

Matthias Miller  28:50
Yep. Thanks. So Hey.

Unknown Speaker  28:53
Thanks. Yep. Take care. You got

Matthias Miller  29:02
cool. Anything from your end?

Speaker 4  29:06
I don't think so. I'm still just, I'm putting pieces together in my brain. I'm working on updating the work breakdown structure based on our conversation, thinking about things. So no coherent thoughts, but Yeah.

Matthias Miller  29:20
Sounds good.

Unknown Speaker  29:22
All right. I'll talk to you later then. Sounds good. Bye.
