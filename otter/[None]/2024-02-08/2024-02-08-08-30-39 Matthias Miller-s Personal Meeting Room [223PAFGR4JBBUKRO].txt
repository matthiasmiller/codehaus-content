Unknown Speaker  00:27
Good morning. Hey, good morning. Good morning

Unknown Speaker  00:40
is it just us or is Mark gonna join?

Matthias Miller  00:44
I have not heard from Mark. I'm not even sure.

Unknown Speaker  00:52
Here he comes.

Unknown Speaker  00:53
Okay. Go

Unknown Speaker  01:01
monitor smart

Unknown Speaker  01:03
Mark

Speaker 1  01:09
no head I told you drew is not going to be on this week or not. But

Matthias Miller  01:16
yes, you had Yeah, you had and I was debating whether we need to have this and then then I realized it would still be productive to have the project management update. And then there are things that you and I need to chat about. We can but I don't know that there's going to be just a whole lot that are Yeah, I mean, it's kind of up to you then as far as what you want to discuss beyond that.

Unknown Speaker  01:41
I do have a few things for you. But

Unknown Speaker  01:45
yeah, let's

Unknown Speaker  01:48
Rajic updates and then go from there. Right.

Speaker 2  01:56
Last week, did you guys set any February goals or intentions for what you're trying to accomplish this month that I should capture? Or should we do that now?

Matthias Miller  02:10
We did have the dev priorities, which I

Unknown Speaker  02:13
did see that

Matthias Miller  02:14
involved accounting cleanup broadly and Mark was a dealer commissions.

Speaker 1  02:25
Perfect. Yeah, see if we get time. Yeah, that was kind of like if we get time.

Speaker 2  02:32
Okay, sounds good. If we don't need to go deeper on that then work for me. Okay, so I had a lot of new tasks I think this week or at least a lot of things to link to tasks so but we can just start with updates. Mark I still have document procedure for closing books for 2023 as a task, how's that going?

Unknown Speaker  02:55
That is still no change on that.

Speaker 2  02:57
Okay. Matthias the vendor invoice warned on missing information slash add warning icon.

Unknown Speaker  03:06
It's in Drew's court to confirm okay.

Speaker 2  03:13
See Joel the track reconciliation by statement or the reconciliation event log? Or is that done? Um,

Speaker 3  03:22
core functionality of reconciling and displaying reconciliations is done.

Unknown Speaker  03:32
There are

Speaker 3  03:34
there's at least annuler a reconciliation, post reconciliation report and a and I think miscellaneous pain points and interface to clean up.

Unknown Speaker  03:53
Okay.

Speaker 2  04:00
Sounds good. Let's see. So Drew is not here. I will skip Drew. So Joel, again, on the income statement account names wrapping in PDF.

Matthias Miller  04:14
I apologize. I bypassed Joe on that one and I just knocked it out and told him to send him an email to make sure he likes what he did. And

Speaker 3  04:21
and I think that email is in my inbox. Okay. So I guess that's my quarter.

Unknown Speaker  04:29
So it's mostly done where you're standing.

Unknown Speaker  04:33
Cool. Okay, cool.

Matthias Miller  04:35
What was that mark?

Speaker 1  04:37
Oh, I was gonna ask Do you have more capacity to do those types of things besides where make it happen maybe

Unknown Speaker  04:54
setting precedents for your sat over there.

Speaker 1  05:00
And if we get a few minutes, I have actually have one crazy idea, but let's not. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  05:08
That sounds dangerous.

Matthias Miller  05:09
You who focuses the rest of the

Speaker 2  05:17
body? All right, well, I better get going before we lose track of all this then block out time for the Go Live plan. Matthias, do you want to talk about that today or talk about that?

Matthias Miller  05:28
No, we have to wait until trees back. So let's keep it on the radar and see if we can talk about it next week when Drew's in the office.

Speaker 2  05:34
Okay, sounds good. How about the vendor invoices do not match accounting issue.

Matthias Miller  05:42
So there were issues with if you go into your comments.

Unknown Speaker  05:47
Um, well,

Matthias Miller  05:49
I moved. So you did end up moving that okay. Yeah. So for

Unknown Speaker  05:53
this one, I just wasn't sure what the update was then.

Matthias Miller  05:57
Can you 10144 Let

Unknown Speaker  06:00
me try something here. 10144.

Matthias Miller  06:04
I kind of think I hate this. My memory is just what was it was Edison that would turn around in line when somebody asked him what his Reinstein turn around and ask people what his are like his own phone number up in the phonebook.

Unknown Speaker  06:21
story is told that Einstein, thanks.

Matthias Miller  06:25
I don't know that. I don't know that. Forgetfulness is a good thing. Correlation, the genius but I appreciate the insinuation. That one, that one is done. And I think we should put it in Drew's court to review. I'm seeing the transaction that we looked at it's now 50 to 67 instead of 50 to 66.

Unknown Speaker  06:51
So, okay,

Speaker 2  06:55
okay. I'm not sure exactly what that mean, but I don't think I need to be so.

Matthias Miller  07:00
Sorry. Yes. Yeah. No, that's

Speaker 2  07:01
totally fine. Okay. How about the 1099 summary reports?

Matthias Miller  07:06
Didn't my court to review I think I'm gonna guess he assigned it to me for code review.

Speaker 2  07:14
About allow company specific signature adjustments.

Unknown Speaker  07:17
Not done.

Unknown Speaker  07:18
Okay. Is it in progress?

Unknown Speaker  07:20
No.

Speaker 2  07:22
Okay. How about Oh, this one's still with the Wayne but add attachments? Add Attachments, RG to deposit record, maybe knew what that meant at one point?

Unknown Speaker  07:33
That's, that's

Matthias Miller  07:40
No, good. Well pull it up. Let's see. This is something else. I was supposed to talk to him about it, wasn't it reading

Speaker 2  07:45
number two, is the Export to Excel acceptable? I don't think he ever

Unknown Speaker  07:49
let's see. Link to print.

Matthias Miller  07:56
I think this is just at this point. I'm just going to call it Dwayne. And if it still bothers him, he can. How about we do this one more bump to it? And I'm just going to close it out with the assumption that Dwayne, we haven't heard back.

Speaker 4  08:24
We're assuming you're okay with this. Please let us know or Yeah, happy to help. If not. Let's close this out here.

Speaker 2  08:36
Okay. Like a good plan. All right. Uncategorized Expense Report revision. Let's see you've had miscellaneous notes in your inbox that I didn't find. I don't know if I need to look for them.

Matthias Miller  08:56
I think can we put this over to Drew's I think I signed off on all of this and put it in Drew's court to review and make sure that he's happy with the expense report.

Unknown Speaker  09:07
Okay

Unknown Speaker  09:12
and then let me see if Nick did the next one

Unknown Speaker  09:20
here let's do this. Nick go to Nick from me.

Unknown Speaker  09:34
user does not select a parent account. Oh.

Unknown Speaker  09:47
Let's do this. Nikolas Ellis.

Matthias Miller  09:55
For the Validate on the deposit record miscellaneous items account is different for the main deposit account. Can you We'll say that I am sending

Speaker 4  10:04
more validation on SEC slash deposits can you please make sure the miscellaneous items account does not match the financial year yes to that

Unknown Speaker  10:41
let's see

Speaker 2  10:49
I think I captured some emails from Nick so I might have a duplicate of this one in here somewhere later but

Unknown Speaker  10:54
I'll capture that okay.

Speaker 2  10:57
Oh jewel ad budget totals to income statements. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  11:00
that is still waiting for Barbash to start I'm

Unknown Speaker  11:08
okay. Yeah

Speaker 1  11:15
maybe we should circle back on this job. But I think you you are still waiting on some feedback from us on IP of whether we look at net or

Speaker 3  11:27
That's That's true on some of on should we at least on acid accounts.

Unknown Speaker  11:36
So sure, okay. Okay.

Speaker 2  11:44
Okay, let's see. Mark I had one that says put together budget totals in an Excel spreadsheet for Matthias to import

Unknown Speaker  11:56
that is in progress but

Unknown Speaker  12:01
not done yet. Okay,

Speaker 2  12:03
great. Got one for Drew. Skipping okay Matthias we have allow attaching statements to reconciles

Unknown Speaker  12:15
which was a to do task.

Unknown Speaker  12:18
Let's see.

Matthias Miller  12:22
Did you want how do you want to handle that? I think we just want an RG memo for now. Or even a well how are we going to want it long term long term we've got we're going to want to push it to s3 so maybe I think can you pull it up and see if we have notes on this? I think Drew was saying that as long as we can just

Speaker 2  12:50
dependent let's see. The note from drew that he wanted it available for January but I don't know if we have I don't have emails or anything related to this right now.

Matthias Miller  13:02
Okay. Joe, I think we I think what we decided was that we would so to make it easier to push to s3 we will put all statements just in a statements. RG eventually. So Joel, could we add in non RG MEMO ON THE reconcile screen? Attachments? Sure. Sure. And do you want me to shoot an email to Nick to knock that out quickly? Or do you want to hand it off?

Unknown Speaker  13:28
Sure. I guess if you it'd be great to shoot him an email to

Matthias Miller  13:33
do that. Here I will and I'll

Unknown Speaker  13:36
maybe CCU and so the during the loop Ellis Joel Adnan RG memo to financial account conciliation screen or attachments

Speaker 2  14:07
can I move down to the next one? Yes. Okay, add budget columns to income statement. See,

Unknown Speaker  14:15
Wait, didn't we just talk about it?

Speaker 2  14:19
Okay. Well is a duplicate of allowing What's that one? It's the meeting one okay. Yeah. So let me merge

Speaker 2  14:42
did you swear half of this is just merging things into other things which is totally

Unknown Speaker  14:56
perfect. Okay, Are we had

Speaker 2  15:05
budget concern actually balance sheet accounts? Not income statement? That's a weird email. I think I just copied it. You know what that is?

Unknown Speaker  15:19
Right, this is connected with

Unknown Speaker  15:23
with the other stuff, right?

Matthias Miller  15:26
Yeah. Do we have something specifically? Well, yeah, I mean, I feel like this falls into the

Unknown Speaker  15:33
marks. I

Matthias Miller  15:35
think this can be closed out and in light of Mark's going to come up with what the budget should look like, and how he wants the budgets to work. And yeah, I think this this thing can just be closed out. Okay. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  15:57
Sorry, I

Unknown Speaker  15:57
can take Okay. Good.

Speaker 2  16:06
investigates create process for moving payments from one sales order to another.

Unknown Speaker  16:12
So my radar, okay, nothing, nothing changed,

Speaker 2  16:15
nothing changed. Okay. That's all we had for February. Now I have a whole bunch of things that came in this week over email, some of which I'm sure are duplicates. But we've got the handling historical reconciled transaction. Is that part of what we've already talked about?

Matthias Miller  16:35
That is another process that we should manage. Drew's I sent an email to Drew Drew, we'll have to take a look at do some manual work, and it's gonna have to come back to me. Okay. And I just realized that the RTO rounding issue would be a brilliant one to push over to Nick as well. So I'm gonna go do that.

Unknown Speaker  16:56
Okay.

Unknown Speaker  17:00
Nicolas?

Speaker 2  17:09
Well, what is our due date or gold date for this historical reconciled transaction issue? That a February thing?

Matthias Miller  17:20
Well, I don't Yeah, let's get it. I think it's a get it done in February, but we don't have a gun to our heads. Okay. There was the time sensitive aspect of it was something that was keeping reconciles from completing but

Unknown Speaker  17:36
that is done, I assume.

Matthias Miller  17:40
Yeah, pending an update in which will happen as soon as Josh stops making the platform unstable.

Unknown Speaker  17:50
Let's see. We've got your continue. Mark. Sorry.

Speaker 1  17:55
I just, Oh, just a quick note, I saw Messiah or Josh. No. Yash did say he did push an update live. Either Wednesday morning or Tuesday night then. You're probably aware of but I just looking at your emails. I thought it looked like backing it might be later. I'm not sure of it. But on our call Wednesday morning, Josh Jitsi pushed an update live.

Unknown Speaker  18:30
Caught it.

Matthias Miller  18:30
I was not aware of that I had looked at with Josh. I was gonna see if we can. Anyway, yeah. See how critical was that? Good. Well, I guess that

Unknown Speaker  18:42
addresses that.

Speaker 2  18:46
Okay. The chart of accounts, reports conditionally include columns.

Matthias Miller  18:56
Think i NT 403.

Unknown Speaker  18:58
Let's see. Let

Matthias Miller  18:59
me see if I thought I sent this over to maybe 803.

Unknown Speaker  19:05
A 403. Is what it was. I thought I said it's over to this would be a great one for

Matthias Miller  19:12
94

Unknown Speaker  19:15
is the last one to update it.

Speaker 3  19:17
Somehow I thought it was I had no reaction. It was done. It's

Matthias Miller  19:27
not marked ready to test but

Unknown Speaker  19:29
it's coded. So it's an export. Not sure where the bottleneck is but okay.

Unknown Speaker  19:38
Are we ready to put a date on it? Does it belong in February?

Matthias Miller  19:45
Yeah, I mean, it should be live by I mean, well, realistically put the ninth on it because he's isn't he heading out next week?

Unknown Speaker  19:55
Oh, yeah, yeah. Okay. Okay. Yep, sounds good.

Speaker 2  19:59
Can bank two sheets integrate with all banks?

Unknown Speaker  20:03
DREW? Okay.

Unknown Speaker  20:07
We need to put a date on it

Unknown Speaker  20:12
I don't think I don't know.

Speaker 2  20:20
And then just broadly, February or March, I guess is what we're looking at here or,

Matthias Miller  20:24
or do you think? Do you think Drew's realistically going to have chance? A chance to take a look at this before? March sometime?

Speaker 1  20:35
No, I don't think so. With him being out most of this week and then No, I think, yeah. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  20:44
My one

Matthias Miller  20:46
transactions by contact report. I'm assigned this to me make it do today and let me go spec it out and

Speaker 4  20:57
get Nick to do it. As long as I understand exactly what I'm after, but we'll see and if not, I guess he won't do it. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  21:08
Sounds good.

Speaker 2  21:10
Reconciling open state periods. I had a note to myself. Is this closed? I don't remember why.

Unknown Speaker  21:17
Jewel, are we able to reconcile within periods? No.

Unknown Speaker  21:22
That's looks like this was the email. Oh,

Speaker 3  21:25
okay. That's gotcha. Gotcha. Yes, yes. Okay, so

Unknown Speaker  21:30
this should be close. We're done.

Speaker 5  21:33
Yeah. Okay. Well that's handy

Unknown Speaker  21:41
slow Chart of Accounts.

Matthias Miller  21:45
This is closed out it's a duplicate of conditionally

Speaker 4  21:49
visible columns in the chart of accounts. Okay. Okay

Speaker 2  22:01
builder cash transaction reports. I feel like we might have an incident on this too.

Matthias Miller  22:07
I don't know but that should be due to tomorrow assigned to me I need to

Unknown Speaker  22:12
Yeah, okay. That

Matthias Miller  22:14
that was that's where this was at. Sorry. I feel like I've kind of been throttling back on this a little bit and kind of got my head out of the game this this week so that I would make that let's make it do today and or do tomorrow something one or the other. And I'll focus on that and get get a draft put together

Unknown Speaker  22:35
Perfect. Okay,

Speaker 2  22:37
this is just an email I need to go back through for myself once we go through all this same thing reconcile that filtering correctly should be by company. Joel that's okay. Just wanted to double check before I close without standard vendor invoices needing payments pay by cheque incidents is going on there. She needs

Matthias Miller  23:03
to question 945 That's done. Okay. And

Unknown Speaker  23:06
Drew confirmed it perfect.

Unknown Speaker  23:11
432

Matthias Miller  23:14
Sorry, I should have I should have copied you

Unknown Speaker  23:17
on some of those emails and then you would know 9432

Speaker 2  23:24
I try my best doesn't always happen but I try to link them up okay, I

Unknown Speaker  23:32
think this is done

Matthias Miller  23:35
okay, I mean it's it's needing code review but that'll I think we can just let

Speaker 5  23:43
let CCI take care of that. Sure. Okay. Sounds good.

Speaker 2  23:50
Let's see 9450 accounting transactions linked to record report

Unknown Speaker  23:56
Swen is also done and I think we can

Matthias Miller  24:05
rely on CCI doing it taking taking it from here Okay.

Unknown Speaker  24:11
Sounds good.

Speaker 2  24:12
9447 assists checks and deposits

Matthias Miller  24:21
that's that's done let's assign it to Drew for verification though.

Unknown Speaker  24:25
Okay

Unknown Speaker  24:35
well, thanks

Speaker 2  24:35
for all the notifications click up but shit in my way. Okay. 9444 is this check record add notes memo

Matthias Miller  24:51
was it again 9444.

Unknown Speaker  24:58
Also

Matthias Miller  25:01
Yeah, let's add it. Let's assign it to due for review. It's pending an update, but we should have and hopefully have an update before he gets back in the office. Sounds

Speaker 2  25:09
good. Okay, now I've got some emails. So I don't know if there'll be duplicates, but we've got a prepaid approve status.

Speaker 4  25:16
I took care of that. Okay, fantastic.

Unknown Speaker  25:26
vendor and company mismatch.

Matthias Miller  25:32
This requires further conversation. I think it's back in juice court to respond, but we need to.

Speaker 2  25:39
Okay, what was February? For this? I assume?

Matthias Miller  25:43
Yeah, I think it's really hyper already, because I think it was getting injuries way. So

Unknown Speaker  25:49
Well, will you be back next week?

Unknown Speaker  25:51
Yes.

Speaker 2  25:53
Let's put it been weeks, some time to try to keep it in. Okay. How about the duplication tweak? That's I

Matthias Miller  26:04
think that's that needs some attention from me. And I don't know what the priority is, as I recall. We are not correctly handling

Speaker 4  26:20
checks in check and deposit trend or check transactions?

Unknown Speaker  26:25
Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  26:27
I'd be slated for March. So we can

Unknown Speaker  26:31
Should I just go ahead and put it out towards the beginning of March?

Unknown Speaker  26:34
Okay, that's good.

Speaker 2  26:38
All right. How about migrating old transaction dates to new statements?

Unknown Speaker  26:43
Oh,

Matthias Miller  26:45
this was related to a previous one that we had.

Speaker 4  26:49
That I said is assigned to Drew and it's in Drew's court. Okay. Remember what the task name was? Something with reconciled dates or something or, okay.

Speaker 2  27:02
Let me see if I can match it up. That might be enough for me to be able to contextualize it. So I'll see what I can do there. Printing issues on income statement,

Matthias Miller  27:11
the signage, you're drew to review. Okay. Perfect.

Unknown Speaker  27:25
Okay,

Speaker 2  27:25
I think that's the end of my list. Is there other stuff that we need to talk about then? Or is that it for me?

Matthias Miller  27:34
That's all I've got marker. Joel, do you guys have anything else we should talk about?

Speaker 3  27:42
Mark mentioned circling back on the records and the budget stuff. I don't know if you were thinking in this call or just over time.

Speaker 1  27:54
I thought if we have a bit of time, we could do it on this call. I just send you an email. Oh, okay. Some details. But that and if Matthias if you have some time, we could play around or look at the I forget what we call it but the the report you created last week on our it's basically a bank transaction. But you can use it for use case we use it for was what deposits hit our bank this time period and then you back and concatenated the things like contact name, the deposit date, the payment type, and created a report and then you're going to do something like that with fences as well. So those those would be two things that if we have time on this call yet I like to

Matthias Miller  29:03
Okay, so So the so the Ministry of Economy, so the deposit, I mean, basically the income and expense cash reports. And then the what was Was there one before that that you mentioned?

Speaker 1  29:22
Yeah, like the budget the thing that with Joel on how do we think about actual expenses? On an asset account versus like actual versus budget? Do we look at the sum total of all debits and credits? You want to look at debit the sum total of all the debits or how do we when we say Yeah, how's this we make a budget? I'm gonna compare that to our actual expenses. What are our actual expenses Right acid account

Matthias Miller  30:02
so Andre I think we're done with you we can dive into that and then let's dive into the budget piece with Joel here and then Joe you can drop off and we can dig into the cash

Unknown Speaker  30:15
dashboards. Sounds good,

Unknown Speaker  30:17
thanks. All right

Matthias Miller  30:25
all right. So in Mark did you say you send an email regarding this?

Speaker 1  30:29
Yeah, I sent emails to both you and Joel. It would come from the Raspberry Pi which is now sent from a slightly different email something like files and inside automation Josh nicely or

Unknown Speaker  30:47
I got I got it. Let me

Matthias Miller  30:50
open it up. And then it's got a password on it.

Speaker 1  30:56
Oh, yeah, well, okay, those that those files are for last if we still have time, on what I mentioned earlier, like here, but y'all I think, do I send you one that's called bye budget discussions or something like that.

Speaker 3  31:16
Okay. Is that just today that you sent that?

Speaker 1  31:23
Yeah, just like a few minutes ago, it would have come from Matthias what is email?

Matthias Miller  31:28
It's insight files at Josh nicely.com

Unknown Speaker  31:30
Okay,

Unknown Speaker  31:32
let me see.

Matthias Miller  31:35
Did you Mark did you send that one the first one to both of us or just a Joel

Unknown Speaker  31:41
I think that one just to Joel okay

Speaker 3  31:47
I'm searching on that from address and I'm actually not seeing anything

Speaker 1  31:54
well and let's let's do this. If you could, here's what I think would be most helpful if you could just go to the shared time but go into shared time and import the general ledger for a few the asset account and I can give you the account came up here we could just look

Matthias Miller  32:22
what what date range are you looking for? On the General Ledger

Speaker 1  32:26
to year to date? 20. Year to date 2024

Unknown Speaker  32:31
Then we account or accounts

Speaker 1  32:35
Bill did you change your email address? Is it still Joel dot washi good at Code crafters i ntl.com.

Speaker 3  32:42
Yeah, and that's IW a SHA GEIW

Speaker 1  32:47
A S H IGE there was net didn't send maybe just would take a little more time by US did sent but anyway, I was just for futures I think we're good. So besides the accounts I'd like to look at in general ledger rt 12.0 7.1 10 It'd be building and building improvements. Then that we just like with all four of them 110 111 112 and 113 are the

Speaker 6  33:27
12 dot o 7.7 dot everything cool got it

Speaker 1  33:44
so I didn't know if I thought maybe if you just send me a copy of those at least those that know Drew and I looked at him last week and I think that's

Matthias Miller  33:58
and then do you want that as a PDF it is an Excel file

Unknown Speaker  34:00
PDF PDF is fine

Unknown Speaker  34:06
here and I will

Matthias Miller  34:11
get this email started and then

Speaker 4  34:16
I don't know if it's helpful but I can drop the link then into the chat for the rest of you guys if you want to do that for some reason.

Matthias Miller  34:57
All right in the mark, just let me know when you've got that

Unknown Speaker  35:13
until that sends Matthias, the other file two files that I send to you A B underscore 21 0209. And then B as those are the

Speaker 1  35:28
I'm asking for Well, here's so these are the payroll. These are the files that when we currently were doing payroll, inside payroll module, we calculate the gross pay, send that off to me who does payroll, just puts it into QuickBooks. And, you know, calculates all the withholdings and everything she does the net pays the employee withholdings and pays the calculates the employer taxes, then it's those payouts. And then she turns around, sends me that transaction file of the transactions related to payroll for that week, which I then dumped into this spreadsheet. And also that calculate the transaction. Import the push back into I had this idea that we could take a quick look at it and see if there's, I mean, it's working right now. But just take a quick look at it and see if there's any major elements that could be made for that. But I do have those reports now. So let's just those.

Unknown Speaker  36:57
So

Speaker 1  37:00
looking at these, as far as how we think about actual expenses on asset accounts, you know, as comparative to budget, if I look at

Speaker 1  37:19
it well, if I look at the buildings and building improvements.

Unknown Speaker  37:26
What I where

Speaker 1  37:27
I envision this is we set a budget and we say we're going to spend that's probably not a good one. But more likely, it would be production equipment and fixtures, we say that, you know, in this given year, we're going to budget or $150,000 of production equipment and fixtures we know we've got to replace a forklift, one shed trailer, and one shed mu and miscellaneous bills or whatever, smaller items or we allocate a number and then we need a way to whoever other were our tracking against their budget. So I and the reason I said the building and building improvements is not a good one is roof starts to leak or you need more gravel on your parking lot. Do it most likely whether or not you're over budget, but the production equipment and fixtures is more of a planned thing. But at the same principle applies. I think for these week, it's simply my looking at this, I think are these unlike the expense. revenue accounts, we should simply do a total debits because there is a chance that on assets you're going to have a sale of assets, which I think you just be excluded from the actual expenses like so we say that we're going to when we set a budget for a year on something like production equipment and fixtures. We this is what we're planning to spend on capital expenditures in this category. I don't think I don't see as when we're doing that thing. 150,000 But in September, we're planning to sell that old forklift and we expect to gain $5,000 on that asset and try to budget for that. So does that make sense? Or do you am I overcomplicating things by just looking at the total debits

Matthias Miller  39:59
I I have a proposal. If I can interject, please could could we on the on the financial account? Could we I don't know how we can we say is this a budget bill account? And if so, what is the methodology of budgeting some of the credits or credits in debt or subsidiary some of the debits or debits minus credits and and simply allow allow you guys to decide on a per account basis how you want to handle this and it's a very tactical solution than on our RN that's what we do

Speaker 3  40:40
well, and and you don't need if you change your mind you don't need to come back to us

Unknown Speaker  40:52
I think that's a great idea.

Unknown Speaker  40:54
Well, that really isn't

Speaker 1  41:03
so the the options that we would make available for that is either sum of debits, sum of debits and credits are a better way of explaining that but basically the debits minus credits is there a reason we would use like I'm seeing like some of Right Is there anything different from that like an income account should that be credits minus debits

Speaker 3  41:41
if we're budgeting for a certain amount of revenue I suppose

Speaker 1  41:50
I'm saying just the the options that we pray that we allow for budgeting

Matthias Miller  41:58
Can we can we just call it increase increases and increases versus decreases in further basket under the hood

Speaker 3  42:12
I really like that because yeah, you would be very unlikely to budget exclusively for credits on an asset account

Matthias Miller  42:29
I suppose if you're if you're looking to close out a business maybe

Speaker 3  42:37
yeah, I I like that so basically your budget for gross

Speaker 3  42:49
Well, basically gross amount or net amount right? I mean

Speaker 1  42:58
your gross would be masking it under the hood, like gross, it's gross. Under the hood, you would say if it's an income account, you just look at the credit side and if it's an expense or an asset account, you look at the debit side that net would be exactly that.

Unknown Speaker  43:19
Both columns, right.

Unknown Speaker  43:23
Yeah, I like that. And I I would suggest we just I guess the heart is is good we set a default on accounts that they're always default to net

Unknown Speaker  43:41
I think you appropriate

Speaker 1  43:46
default everything to net and then they change as as needed. Okay, yeah, change, make those changes.

Unknown Speaker  43:59
Brilliant.

Speaker 3  44:01
I love iterative conversations with people who are all contributing perspective

Matthias Miller  44:19
you know, Mark, just want to once again highlight this we've come a long way in terms of simplify, simplify, simplify.

Speaker 1  44:31
We have and it's like this, to me is a brilliant solution of we're not building crazy logic into the software we're making. user friendly and simple to use. So whoever changed your mind on something, you know, it's easy to change. No. That's

Unknown Speaker  44:57
awesome. Cool. Well,

Speaker 3  45:01
is that my part in the call them? Or is there more than that I should participate in?

Speaker 1  45:15
I, the only question I have is the income statement. Really, really minor issue the lines? That has been faked, right?

Matthias Miller  45:29
Yes. Let me see if it's I can't remember if it I'm pretty sure it's live.

Speaker 4  45:35
Let me do it, do a quick test just to find out.

Speaker 1  45:46
So, Joe, where are we at as far as timeline on budget? If I remember correctly, we'd said something like, the 15th. Right.

Unknown Speaker  46:00
Sorry, go ahead.

Unknown Speaker  46:02
Well, there's

Speaker 1  46:04
I think we've we've identified two different reports we'll need one is a budget versus actual expenses. And my thought would be on that, that you have starting out, we're only going to budget probably like eight or 10. Accounts, that you could say, show me only the ones that have budget numbers. So it would, you know, just give you a report that says Here are two asset accounts where you've entered budget numbers, and two revenue accounts and five expense accounts and be a really short little report that just gives you that. And then I think prior to that we talked about adding a column onto the income statement to show budget numbers versus actual numbers on the income statement. Obviously not sure. asset, right. So but if we had to pick between the two, adding it to the income statement, or just the standalone report, that does show me all the accounts where you budgeted for versus their actuals, that we would prefer that one would be the one the ideal one to have first, but I don't know where you're at.

Speaker 3  47:22
Okay, well. Where I'm at after looking at the still to be started on the Bangladesh side today is thinking it's possible, but a little worrisome. Far as timeline. But and honestly, I'm

Unknown Speaker  47:51
the

Speaker 3  47:53
income statement column was on my radar, I'm not sure that the that the independent report was, although I think it's fairly simple to comparatively, I think that's a simpler one to implement.

Unknown Speaker  48:11
So

Speaker 3  48:14
if if highest value to you highest priority is to create an independent report that so basically, we would just select a report, have a report that specifies or that includes only accounts with budget amounts? Is that what you're saying

Speaker 1  48:47
that that was my, my thought Yes. Now, okay. Like, if we could do something like the income statement that says, you know, suppress accounts with zero transactions? If we could, if we could, that were easy to add, that would be ideal, because then we could say, show me only the accounts of budgeted amounts, or show me all the accounts that have actuals with with values, then, what that would do is Most times we would just look at the only the

Unknown Speaker  49:26
only the

Speaker 1  49:28
accounts that have budgeted numbers, and then, you know, our tracking, but then we could also look at the other report and say, well, here's how much we've spent here to date in this asset column, or here's, on this column. We really should enter budget numbers for these and then you know, we could buy the numbers for those so I'm not the type toggle there would be like, only two or you can come up with more. Better, better names for that. But basically show only sponsored by user values or show all.

Speaker 3  50:15
Sure, sure. Oh, and I guess on, right, because for oh, this is interesting. Because

Speaker 3  50:35
it's interesting. We talked about adding columns to the income statement we also talked about, about what sort of budgeting we want on asset accounts. But and maybe it simply wasn't documented. But I'm, as far as I know, we didn't actually talk collectively about the fact that budgets on asset accounts actually, by definition won't be showing up on the income report. And so yes, we do need the separate report that

Unknown Speaker  51:23
that you're talking about?

Unknown Speaker  51:26
Um, yeah.

Speaker 3  51:29
Yeah, what's sort of? Oh, go ahead.

Speaker 1  51:34
Oh, I was just gonna say, I mean, we want I think we longterm, we want both of them. But tell me what makes sense for you, as far as Sure. Sure. We haven't compiled budget numbers, yet? Sure. I know, they're working on it. But Sure. Um,

Unknown Speaker  51:52
so I guess one big question is, how important is structure on this report? As an RO structure? You know, are you going to

Unknown Speaker  52:09
wish that

Speaker 3  52:14
debt reports? Sorry, that that accounts? Show the hierarchy of have their apparent accounts? And if so, how strong is that wish?

Speaker 3  52:38
Yeah, I guess. Oh, just basically, how are you picturing the rows being laid out in this report?

Speaker 1  52:49
Am I thinking of them, like a balance sheet and income statement, which shows the parent accounts up above? Yeah, or am I just, I mean, the most I would be back make the most, the easiest way to get started would be to just have only the account, just the account, nothing else just like, well, if dot o 7.1 10. When can billing improvements and then it? And if so then that would be? Okay. But I think if we would have that on the actual versus budget account, that would would be all we would need? And then we'll also add it to the income statement, which obviously on the income statement it would.

Unknown Speaker  53:39
Sure. Sure. Excellent.

Speaker 3  53:46
And what are you thinking about for what would you wish for ordering of those rows?

Speaker 1  53:58
I will just order them for the numbers. Like if you were to I think if you were to do a sorry, they would all that that was the intent when we created our account numbers like well, oh, seven 110, you know, comes before 12 Oh, 715. And so the initial thought, What? What works well for you?

Speaker 3  54:21
Okay. Okay, so And do you always want account numbers displayed or? Not necessarily?

Speaker 1  54:34
Yeah, I think we need to if we don't display the hierarchy. Oh, sure. Sure. Because we have duplications of the file account, then name.

Speaker 3  54:50
Cool. Well, I think all of your answers so far are moving us toward the simple side of implementing the support, which is helpful.

Speaker 6  55:06
Good. Cool. Well,

Unknown Speaker  55:11
I do think I do think that should be doable. I'll help need to figure out where all the bundle best team is if I need to jump in and do some coding to help out or what needs to happen, but

Unknown Speaker  55:41
I think that should be doable.

Speaker 1  55:45
As me Do you know, as far as dates like, I'm not this is not nearly urgent. I just just wanted to know, like, Okay, I think we talked about the 15th. But then we were talking on the income statement. I mean, just if you say the 22nd. Me, right, yeah. What is what is the

Speaker 3  56:04
expect? Okay, so, so what I was saying just now is, we had said the 15th. I I think we can make it happen, although perhaps with

Unknown Speaker  56:21
with

Speaker 3  56:23
pooling resources that that would be nice to use elsewhere. But I mean, I'm okay. It's the eighth now.

Unknown Speaker  56:42
So,

Speaker 3  56:45
I mean, if the 22nd is still is still workable, I think we I mean, is workable. And I think we could I think we could get both reports. Both the budget versus actual and income column additions

Unknown Speaker  57:11
by that point.

Unknown Speaker  57:14
Without without a lot of reshuffling.

Unknown Speaker  57:22
So I'd say

Unknown Speaker  57:27
back to you.

Speaker 1  57:30
Know that I mean, that sounds good. i That sounds there. I was just making some notes here for my reference. But it sounds like

Speaker 1  57:45
no, I think you've I was thinking I'll type up an email, shoot it your way, just to make sure we're thinking the same thing. But we I mean, I don't know that it's even worth doing that. I think we're pretty clear on what the end result will be. So I'm happy with that. To February 22. And

Speaker 5  58:05
I think you are you have a clearer picture of what what we're looking for. Right?

Speaker 3  58:11
I believe so. For us, I like it. Okay. Well, thank you. Good talking with all of you. And

Unknown Speaker  58:27
I'll, oh,

Speaker 3  58:30
I was going to say and I'll see you next week. But I am actually traveling on Thursday. So I may leave it to Matthias and try to chip in any relevant info before then.

Matthias Miller  58:45
Are you going to be in Wednesday?

Unknown Speaker  58:49
This one, I mean this coming.

Matthias Miller  58:51
When's the last day that you'll be in before you leave?

Unknown Speaker  58:55
Wednesday? Wednesday. Okay.

Speaker 4  58:57
I might pin Audra, and she might start with you for some project that that's

Unknown Speaker  59:01
awesome. Awesome.

Unknown Speaker  59:04
Okay, have a great one. Oh,

Speaker 1  59:06
are you headed to theories? Are you going to Bangladesh? Joel?

Speaker 3  59:11
That comes later. So a It's rather interesting, actually. Our youngest daughter has. Well, I think it started when one of her honorary uncle's in Bangladesh, gave her a stuffed panda for a birthday. And since then, she has been fascinated with pandas. Pandas are all owned by China, and are hereby pair in the process of leaving the US So as license agreements and and so we are planning a road trip, sort of a lightning trip to the Atlanta zoo to see the pandas before they leave.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:20
Yeah. So

Speaker 1  1:00:22
that's interesting. So in in, eventually there will be no pandas in the US. In the zoos.

Speaker 3  1:00:29
Yes. I mean, unless, unless new new agreements are made for for having them. But over the last several years, the the trend has basically been that, that as existing agreements expire, then China's taking back their pandas

Speaker 1  1:01:02
is that the only country that would the only place where they're native the only country in the world that

Unknown Speaker  1:01:07
would have pandas? I believe so.

Speaker 1  1:01:14
Interesting, how many? I mean, are there? Are there only a handful of pairs remaining in the US in zoos? I

Speaker 3  1:01:21
think that's right. I'm not sure if there are beyond Atlanta. But right now,

Speaker 7  1:01:28
I do use the pandas, but I don't know if they still do.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:33
Yeah.

Speaker 3  1:01:36
Yeah, I'm not sure what the current status is. And but but certainly the the opportunities to see them without traveling to China are not increasing right now.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:51
I was just

Speaker 1  1:01:52
hearing you're going to travel from Kansas to Atlanta. I assume there's, I would guess most suits have pandas. I didn't realize that you need to, there's only Wow.

Unknown Speaker  1:02:13
Yeah, you'll really have to absorb all you can when you see them.

Speaker 5  1:02:19
Right. Right. Yeah. Well,

Speaker 3  1:02:22
our kids love road trips. I mean, I think we all enjoy them somewhat. And so it'll be we're expecting it will be a good experience. And definitely a Memory Maker. So.

Speaker 1  1:02:42
Yeah. Well, I'm sure you've also made plans for me, we have to talk about this on another call or another time but make plans for the great American Eclipse.

Unknown Speaker  1:02:54
Big part of that. Oh,

Speaker 3  1:02:56
April, you know, we have not made plans that but yes, that's something we should keep in mind. We were out of the country when the last one came across the US. So

Unknown Speaker  1:03:10
yeah. Well,

Speaker 1  1:03:14
I know that. I don't think it will go over Kansas. Or Colorado if I saw the map correctly, but I know there's we're going to be about right in. Right. in a good spot. So I guess if you need I'm sure there's places a lot closer you could go but throwing that out though. I'm gonna come to Ohio. You could come to see the Eclipse and

Speaker 3  1:03:40
Oh, wow. Oh, that's it. Is that an April

Unknown Speaker  1:03:45
8. Okay, yeah. Oh,

Unknown Speaker  1:03:51
that's very cool. Huh? Well, I will have to bear that in mind. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:02
Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:06
Oh, good. Well,

Speaker 1  1:04:10
good. Good. Safe travels and enjoy your road trip and enjoy the pandas. I had to think if you I don't know if you have the Berenstain Bears the children but might we say have one about do you have the one about neighbors where the panda family moved in next door? That would be a good one to have.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:38
Right, right. You know, I

Speaker 3  1:04:41
don't think I've seen that one actually. But that's great. That's great. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:04:46
check it out. It would it would fit well with what you're doing next.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:54
Indeed.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:58
Yeah.

Speaker 3  1:05:00
Well, good talking with you, Mark and all. And I guess I'll plan on connecting in a couple of weeks or connecting in this venue anyway, likely by email before that.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:18
So talk with you later. Sounds good.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:22
Yep. All right, good. All right.

Speaker 7  1:05:28
Let's is needed to work or quick break, Mark. So wait for him to turn.

Speaker 1  1:05:40
I thought I heard a different voice and I hadn't realized there was anybody else on other than Messiah's. So yeah. So you are you are now crafters or silver loom, right?

Speaker 7  1:05:55
Yeah, we go under we'd go into code grafters now. And yeah, switching the name of the software. From from what I'm able to understand. Yeah, everything is now switching from App hosting to silver Lehmann. The name of software well, so yeah, that's been it's been a pretty smooth transition actually. Yeah, obviously been a couple little bumps in the road but I think there's definitely been transitioned out there that have gone a lot rougher Yeah, it's been good

Unknown Speaker  1:06:40
yeah, the

Speaker 1  1:06:43
I'd be curious to hear and maybe you have this story, but I asked him if I asked some time ago about silver loom how they came up with that and he said I should just ask Elos at some point so like to hear the story of how it was through rosewood and you ended up with with that

Unknown Speaker  1:07:02
name and yeah

Speaker 7  1:07:06
I'm trying to remember how that came about as well. They had a whole bunch of different names and whatnot that they were throwing around I forget what it was that really sold them on silver but yeah, they had it's probably close to 100 Different names that they were to some degree considering for for the software

Unknown Speaker  1:07:35
change, but

Unknown Speaker  1:07:38
yeah

Speaker 1  1:07:44
yeah, I was just looking at the path of the eclipse I think. Looks like Ohio would probably be one of the closest places for you to experience it. Maybe you have plans already though. I

Speaker 7  1:08:00
haven't actually. I think I'd actually heard about it. But it's my mind. Yeah, Northern Virginia is not looking like it'll be

Unknown Speaker  1:08:16
well,

Speaker 7  1:08:17
no, it looks like we're gonna be a little too far south or it does look like Ohio will be a really good spot

Speaker 1  1:08:29
the one in 2017 I think we had about 90% coverage in Ohio and yeah, I've never experienced a total solar eclipse but yeah. What I can be somebody put a very good story on it in the plane communities Business Exchange, and really explained in depth what all happens right around Adalet like you get you get sunsets all around all around the sun or looks like sunsets and you'll be able to see the planets dark enough that you'll see some stars I think and temperatures going to drop and what kinds of

Unknown Speaker  1:09:24
Yeah, that's yeah. Yeah, that looks interesting.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:34
Think this is the essence of advice and I'm back now.

Matthias Miller  1:09:40
Almost be worth seeing if you can get a one day. Like one day flight go work from I see it's going through Santa Fe. Austin's getting a little bit of it. Austin, Texas. See if there's any good Colorado Springs to eclipse path lights before they fill up. I don't know how many other people have the same idea.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:07
But sometimes, yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:10:08
Lights like that for 100 Couple 100.

Speaker 1  1:10:15
I read a story about I think the one in 2017. Boy was positioned well, and you know, the weather? Well, you know, it's still dependent on clear skies. And so Hawaii is almost always that time of the year clear skies. And so there were people were planning to watch it there, they had to cruise ships. there that were, you know, specifically the decision to watch it. And about two days before the Eclipse trade winds changed. And they said they're going to probably not have clear skies. And I'll and so they were watching the weather and the cruise ships saw a hole in the cloud cover things like miles away or so. And so they took off and were able to watch the Eclipse. actually watch the Eclipse after all, because they moved.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:15
That would be a real, real

Speaker 1  1:11:20
real disappointment if we would have cloudy skies and right see that then you should be in a plane. And so Matthias, we had what was it two things that we wanted to cover?

Matthias Miller  1:11:38
So we have the

Speaker 1  1:11:42
know that? What did you call it like the Bank report?

Matthias Miller  1:11:47
I mean, this is at least how I'm thinking about it, whatever we call it, but it's basically the cash, the cash transactions

Matthias Miller  1:11:59
whether it's deposits or checks.

Speaker 1  1:12:05
So we had mocked up an example on our last on a call last week, that was only on the positive side, where where are you at with that? Or what are next steps on that it's something you know, as soon as we have something that afterwards that works, that we're comfortable that we can, I guess a standard report that we can use, I'd like to get it into billers hands just because they have been used to seeing something similar but different from QuickBooks, and they'd like to have something.

Matthias Miller  1:12:46
Yeah, I can. I mean, as soon as, as soon as I'm off the call, as we're off the call here, I believe we should have gotten everything done so that this information is getting pushed across into accounting. And if that's the case, then we can what I like to do is build the reports that pull off of accounting. And then if you want to talk later today, I could just give you a call. And whenever I've got that send this over to you and we can take a look at that.

Speaker 1  1:13:24
Yeah, that would be good. Okay, you have an in what you're working on? Is it will it be one report like on the day that you pick it you pick your account, like in this case, primary checking? Then will it be one report will be two reports that show the deposits and humans?

Matthias Miller  1:13:50
It can be whatever you want. Would you rather have them together?

Speaker 1  1:13:57
Probably yeah, I mean, one report, but it's not. I'm taking deposits at the top and then is anything changing from the visually on the report and how it functions from what you created last week?

Matthias Miller  1:14:18
I don't think so. But I'll have to get into it a little bit and see if there's any kind of

Unknown Speaker  1:14:21
hiccups that I run into.

Speaker 1  1:14:25
And then you could do the same report on see the credit card accounts if we wanted to see those Right? Correct.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:38
Now there is just

Speaker 1  1:14:39
notes maybe but there are some nuances I thought of that. Make this report that we okay so on the on the bank account, like we have a bunch of like it's asleep. count or an automatic line of credit draw? Can we make so that it ignores those because it's not helpful to see that? We're just we're just trying to see what monies were deposited. What money is, what payments out of this account, can we isolate from beeps is, in some situations daily, you know, money is moving back and forth. And I think to do that the only way the sweets show up is when Drew does the reconciles. And I think he would have done some of the reconciles. annuaire already, so you could test against that. We'll have that and then we'll have a some deposits coming in from other only bank accounts, which I think we would be fine to just show those like, I don't know, if we've, if you're going to see any now already. But moving forward, at least for affordable barn company, you'll have audits coming from these from a chase bank account into the primary bank account. Because we set up a audit only we set up a basic Chase account is our area Chase, it was the only bank that had branches near every one of our dealers where they could deposit, you know, so that they could use to deposit cash and checks that they got us. So obviously those you won't be able to. So what's going to happen most likely is or dealers deposit checks and cash every Friday into that account. And then who's going to try and set up the primary account that it draws. Every Saturday does draws all but the minimum amount from the chase account into our primary CSP account, which will just show as a lump sum. One deposit of $50,000 which is fine, I think, I think we want to show those but not show

Unknown Speaker  1:17:31
beeps Where

Unknown Speaker  1:17:39
are you tracking? Are they making sense with?

Matthias Miller  1:17:43
So there's two ways we can handle this one, we could just not show that. Or we could well there's three ways we can handle this one, we can give a single report from multiple accounts. So it would include both primary checking as well as deposit only account. And then by virtue of that it would exclude the transactions that just transfer between those two. Option two is sounds like it got your attention with that going?

Speaker 1  1:18:10
Well, I didn't realize you could. Okay, keep going.

Matthias Miller  1:18:16
It's all good. It's all good. Option two is we could just show primary checking. And then well in include those as lump sum transfers, option three is only checking and include, you know, exclude them. option four is we could do separate reports for each one.

Speaker 1  1:18:41
Okay, the first report would be the most helpful for our use. Which How would you that would that you'd basically say, I want to run this report for this account, and this account and this account are like for the primary checking and the secondary checking. And then it would just you'd look at the report and say, Oh, here's all the monies we deposited this week here, regardless of where it was deposited. I mean, you looking at that report, you couldn't see whether it was deposited in Chase or partial and savings bank account. Right. Or I'm thinking it would be that would be would not be helpful information. Okay. Do I just mean how hard is using that's pretty straightforward to do. Yeah. Well, if you Okay, what about could we also then include

Unknown Speaker  1:19:55
credit card accounts

Unknown Speaker  1:19:57
with that as well?

Matthias Miller  1:20:04
Yes. And then we need labels that aren't deposits. So it'd be deposits slash

Unknown Speaker  1:20:12
sorry, hang on.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:57
Learn besides busy busy thinking?

Speaker 4  1:21:02
Oh, he was I'm sorry, I haven't dropped off from it again. So

Matthias Miller  1:21:09
we can't use I mean, it's it's deposit slash payments and checks slashing or withdrawals slash charges or something like that. Does that sound like the right?

Speaker 1  1:21:27
Yeah, what what are we using on the uncategorized? Expense? I've been thinking if we could just use the same naming there might be like that. Oh, I have one here. So we've got Jake's slash charges, and then deposits slash payments. What we have there,

Unknown Speaker  1:21:49
we can do that same thing.

Speaker 1  1:21:59
Then on that mean? Okay. So that would be the idea lumping all those together in one, it would basically be all of the the primary and the secondary checking account. And then the credit card account as well. Now, if we am assuming you're going to make that's going to be a list, like a selection, you just select which accounts you want to include in this report. Is that good sound primary checking secondary checking primary credit card and one of the secondary credit cards or two or three, whatever you choose.

Matthias Miller  1:22:40
Yeah, I think so. And then my assumption is this is going to be accessed primarily through the phone menu. So we can just take those answers and put them into the phone menu set up.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:53
It's it's kind of a fixed set of Oh,

Speaker 1  1:22:56
yeah. Eventually, I mean, starting out, I think we'll just be have drew sending them out. But once we know what we want, yeah, you're saying then we could kind of we could set defaults on the phone menu. Right. So if we do that, should we or should we not show like we're gonna have the same thing with credit cards where we're going to show payments to the account coming from checking like, What would be ideal as if we would?

Speaker 5  1:23:35
Okay, I have no idea. If, okay, sorry.

Matthias Miller  1:23:40
We're really going for the interrupting thing this morning? I don't know. Because we're friends are about the big enemies. Could we have a transfers section down at the bottom? That would include all all transactions that are just transfers from one account to the any of these accounts? Oh,

Speaker 1  1:24:02
yeah. You're saying if it if it transfers, so. So that would include the transfer from say, an only checking account into the main into the primary checking account, as well as payment from the primary checking account to pay off, pay down the credit card account? Those types of transfers?

Matthias Miller  1:24:28
Yes, but I guess, if if it would be helpful to see that cache activity. But again, I guess we're not really we're not looking at. I mean, maybe that doesn't even really matter.

Speaker 1  1:24:45
Well, you could dump you could, and I liked the idea of putting it in the section at the bottom if it doesn't take a lot of extra effort to do that like a transfer section and then look at sample two and say, makes a lot of sense. Can you show it there or not? Let's not show it.

Unknown Speaker  1:25:05
Okay, but

Unknown Speaker  1:25:06
a lot of extra work don't don't

Unknown Speaker  1:25:11
a lot of extra work don't show it at all

Unknown Speaker  1:25:20
let's see how easy it is

Unknown Speaker  1:25:27
okay,

Speaker 1  1:25:27
well this is exciting stuff. Good. We're almost at 12 so we can talk about this the other files I sent later that was just the real stuff I'd say this is that payroll is working it's working reasonably well so there's fine with that for right now. Take a look at it. I'd say we get this knocked out. This ash reporting that's

Unknown Speaker  1:26:04
no good. Okay. Well, let

Speaker 4  1:26:07
me start tearing into that as soon as it says I'm off after call here and

Matthias Miller  1:26:17
yeah, get something that the builders can actually see. Okay. Oh, this is exciting. Yes, it is. Really. All right, any anything else? Okay. No,

Speaker 5  1:26:37
that is all I had. Okay, sounds good. Thanks, Mark. Okay, yep.
