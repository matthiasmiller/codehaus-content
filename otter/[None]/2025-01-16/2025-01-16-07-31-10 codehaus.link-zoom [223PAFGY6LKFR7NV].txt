Unknown Speaker  01:35
Hey, hello. We have lots of people showing up. Suddenly,

Matthias Miller  01:41
we do I'm finally letting people in. Power tripping

Unknown Speaker  01:49
right away. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  01:54
feel special. Yes, we're doing

Unknown Speaker  02:01
good morning. Joe doesn't only

Matthias Miller  02:06
given by this thing going. There we go.

Unknown Speaker  02:13
Got some red mug coffee. There mark,

Speaker 1  02:15
yep, red mouth coffee and an aerial services mode,

Unknown Speaker  02:20
alright, look at that.

Unknown Speaker  02:22
All you need. All you need is a Burkholder,

Matthias Miller  02:27
management coaster and a co host.

Matthias Miller  02:34
I, I recently went to a pottery place, and they had these little pincher, finger pincher, yeah, play mugs. My only complaint is that they decided to have ridges in the bottom. So if I drink my matcha, which I love to do, I get matcha stuck down at the bottom of my boxes. So it's a seven out of 10, not a 10 out of 10, but where do you? Where

Unknown Speaker  03:06
do you get your matcha from?

Matthias Miller  03:09
The last round, Amazon, last round, after research, was some Africa organic matcha.

Speaker 2  03:22
You don't drink it from the you don't drink it from the cow horn.

Matthias Miller  03:27
You probably should.

Speaker 1  03:32
So help me out with glass. What? What is, what? Exactly, is it that you're drinking?

Matthias Miller  03:36
Um, it's, it's green tea. It's a special kind of green tea leaves that are ground up into a powder and just drink it kind of like a tea. It's become the rage in coffee shops. You know, coffee shops looking to something else to change it up. So it's most most coffee shops now sell matcha lattes, which they won't tell you, but even Starbucks, unsweetened matcha is like half still, like half sugar, half matcha makes or something like that.

Speaker 2  04:09
All right, sorry, my you said matcha. My brain registered Matthias and, Oh

Speaker 3  04:14
no, not Monte. That's

Unknown Speaker  04:19
That's why I was red horse.

Matthias Miller  04:23
There is one brand of yerba mate that doesn't taste like alfalfa, from what I've heard. I haven't tried it, yeah. Silence, yeah, exactly.

Speaker 2  04:33
So some of the, some of the best mate I've had is where they actually like freeze dry peaches and put it into the into the mate, and so it adds a nice little peach flavor to it, which covers up the silage flavor.

Speaker 1  04:53
So Matthias, if you get bored, let me know where, where you get that matcha. And if. I, I like to try that. The Mate, I tried that. That's where you use that little, yeah, the funny little,

Matthias Miller  05:11
all that you have to have a filter to drink it.

Speaker 1  05:15
I tried to do it long enough to kind of acquire a taste for it, because it was supposed to be kind of cool, but I never got past that.

Speaker 2  05:23
Were you drinking it hot or cold? Hot? Oh, no, you drink it cold. So you actually you pour it, you put it in a cup with a with a filter straw, and then you pour ice water over it, so the hot can get really bitter and kind of weird.

Matthias Miller  05:42
Okay, interesting.

Speaker 1  05:45
Got rid of it all, but you

Matthias Miller  05:56
coming your way? Okay, thank

Speaker 1  05:58
you. It's, I think it's been almost a month since we last talked. So everybody have a good time off or a good vacation?

Unknown Speaker  06:13
Yeah, it was no Go ahead.

Matthias Miller  06:20
Go for, I think Seth vacation of all of us,

Speaker 4  06:23
I probably did. I didn't work much for about three weeks because I was Michelle's area over Christmas, and then the whole family, including my fiance Michelle, went to Oh, hold

Speaker 2  06:35
on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on back up, back up. Little piece of information, you just dropped in that sentence, right there.

Speaker 4  06:43
I had, I not told did none of y'all know about that yet,

Unknown Speaker  06:49
I heard you started dating.

Unknown Speaker  06:52
I've been engaged for like, almost two months.

Matthias Miller  06:56
Oh no, I didn't know that.

Unknown Speaker  06:59
Okay, you just like that in the middle

Unknown Speaker  07:05
of the sentence,

Speaker 4  07:06
thanks. Yeah, that was Thanksgiving Day. So that's been a while. Yeah, so we're in Bangladesh for a week and a half, and we had an apartment there, where we're renting it. And so a lot of the reason for the trip was getting rid of that, because it's just not sustainable to keep long term. So it was busy, but good. She got to see where I grew up, the house we spent 13 years in before we moved back. And yeah, it was just really good. A lot going, but good.

Unknown Speaker  07:45
When's so when's the wedding? June 28

Unknown Speaker  07:50
she's teaching school, so it's a ways out yet.

Unknown Speaker  07:54
My, my, my, they grew up so quick.

Speaker 1  07:59
So are you or plans, your plans to move to Kansas or Yeah? Okay,

Speaker 4  08:04
yep, starting to look for a place to rent here for the first year or two before we buy hopefully.

Unknown Speaker  08:13
Yeah, yeah. Very good. Did

Speaker 1  08:16
you have any of the traditional stinky fish dishes?

Speaker 4  08:21
Um, I think so dad probably did. I don't know if he could go there without having any but the family doesn't really like it. So actually, we had a little bit of the one, the less foul version. Michelle tried it and thought it tasted like strong fish. Wasn't a big fan, but she likes she loved the food in general, though, because she loves new food, spicy food is great. So it was a lot of fun.

Speaker 1  08:52
Well, we had a little taste of some of those foods. Josh sent a whole box of foods from New York City. Oh,

Unknown Speaker  09:03
I don't know nice

Speaker 1  09:07
some things that you would come with, what you would find over there, but yeah,

Unknown Speaker  09:11
nice

Unknown Speaker  09:17
drew, I think you were gonna

Speaker 3  09:19
Oh, well, it's a whole lot more minor than that. Matthias, did you get your podcast launched? I was looking for it, and I was I couldn't find

Matthias Miller  09:28
it, January, 20, except the so I hired people to help me with it, and yesterday was, or sorry, last Friday was supposed to be a full day of episodes, and four people no showed, and one person showed up at the wrong time, so they admitted it was an issue on their end. So it's probably not going to be January, 20, I'm guessing not the way this is looking.

Speaker 3  09:57
What was that? Was that shed Titans? Is that what the name is supposed. To be though, yeah,

Matthias Miller  10:00
yeah,

Unknown Speaker  10:08
yeah, good. Well, I think Dwayne's going to be on vacation next week, right in Florida.

Unknown Speaker  10:20
We we're calling it a family retreat.

Speaker 1  10:25
So good. What's the difference between a vacation and a retreat?

Speaker 2  10:29
It doesn't quite, it doesn't quite sound so, so, uh, uppity, just if you're going on a family retreat, you know, you're, if you're going on vacation, you know, then it's you it, I don't. I'm just playing around with words,

Matthias Miller  10:43
okay,

Speaker 1  10:47
Jackie likes retreat, vacation,

Speaker 2  10:51
as Addison likes to say, vacation sounds bougie.

Matthias Miller  11:01
I've long given up a little bit. Idea of vacation for parents. I think it's family trips. That's what I think it is be that, as it may, Family

Unknown Speaker  11:09
Retreat. Sounds like you're going to conference with speakers.

Speaker 2  11:13
Okay? I like Matthias. It's just family trip.

Matthias Miller  11:18
I'll be your guest speaker. Do I? Long

Speaker 2  11:23
as, as long as it includes a cup of coffee I'm on,

Matthias Miller  11:27
sounds good?

Unknown Speaker  11:33
Well, unless there's something else I'd say, Let's go to the agenda. Oh. And

Unknown Speaker  11:44
start with that.

Speaker 1  11:47
So I wanted first, I wanted to see if the next two weeks work for for everyone. Obviously, I don't know work for you, Dwayne or not, I'd say, if it doesn't, we probably still continue, just because I expect some of this year end, things we might need in the class and Seth's help on things. But does, yeah, I guess is there do any of these times, the 23rd and the 30th? Do those? Is there anyone that or those times do not work?

Speaker 2  12:28
Yeah, 23rd wouldn't work for me, but the the 30th definitely would.

Matthias Miller  12:33
Okay, that should be good for me. Shouldn't be fine here, okay, 30th

Speaker 3  12:39
probably won't work for me. I mean, I'm I may have an opportunity to just jump on the call, but because that's my sister in law's getting married that week,

Speaker 1  12:51
none of like earlier in the week. I mean, wouldn't work

Speaker 3  12:55
Monday, but if I can avoid being in a meeting, that would be great. But if you want to do Monday, let's

Speaker 1  13:04
leave the 23rd in place and then look at whether we need to do the 30th or not on at that time.

Unknown Speaker  13:18
Yeah, yo, I could. I could possibly call you?

Speaker 1  13:22
Well, maybe we're a place where it's not needed, so let's, I'd say, let's just look at it next week and see. So closing transactions, my understanding is that has all been completed. And I don't know, I mean, through, have you looked at this at all like what it entails? Seth, would would now be a good time for you to walk us through, you know, practical use on how we're going to be using it, how you expect it to function. Or, Sure,

Unknown Speaker  13:59
let me just share screen. I

Unknown Speaker  14:04
mean, in a nutshell, my understanding is that this is once we once we've

Unknown Speaker  14:14
no

Speaker 1  14:16
okay, go ahead and explain, just kind of an overview on what,

Speaker 4  14:20
basically on a transaction we now have an is closing transaction check box, and then that will clear it. Let me double check which reports it is here. Let me drag this PC over,

Speaker 3  14:38
probably the balance sheet, because the January balance sheet is off right now,

Unknown Speaker  14:44
okay, no, they're included in the balance sheet,

Unknown Speaker  14:51
okay, but excluded

Speaker 4  14:53
from income statement, right? Where's the main one? Yeah?

Speaker 3  14:59
Yeah. So that's that would be, yeah, okay, makes sense.

Speaker 4  15:08
So I think if you would include them, if you would exclude them from the balance sheet, your numbers would go waggy.

Unknown Speaker  15:16
I think I wish I was a little closer to having developed this, but

Speaker 4  15:23
I had talked it through with Joel, and he was thinking, balance sheet needs to include them. Income Statement is the main one that shouldn't at this point. And trying to think if there was

Speaker 3  15:34
Yeah, because in the income statement, how is that you're you're wanting to zero out your your net income or the balance sheet. I mean, not zero it out, but move it so it would affect your income statement for the year, if it would show up there, yeah.

Speaker 4  16:07
So that's what it is at this point. If it should be something else, then we can keep working on it, but,

Speaker 3  16:14
but so it's simply just a matter of taking a regular transaction creation click in that box. Yeah, good.

Speaker 4  16:24
We couldn't. Oh, wait, we have a report to what? When was this? Oh, the test system hasn't been updated in a long time. I Let's do last year. So we have a checkbox on here to include possible closing transactions that'll make it now this one doesn't find any i

Speaker 4  17:03
Okay, here's some. Here are ones that from last year that we think could be closing transactions. We it wasn't accurate enough to try to to just automatically label them, but we make so you can search and see if there's any we think might be, and what

Speaker 3  17:22
would the criteria be for what that pulls up like, something that goes like from certain accounts, certain accounts,

Speaker 4  17:30
I don't remember offhand, a temporary does it reference a temporary account and a Permanent equity account? Oh,

Unknown Speaker  17:39
okay, that would make sense.

Speaker 1  17:46
But what do we what? What needs done on Once we're satisfied that 24 numbers are done like to or is there nothing we're doing to lock those numbers? Oh, that part. I mean, that's not, that's

Unknown Speaker  18:00
not related, that's unrelated to this. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  18:06
Like, if you're clear on that, then we don't even need to

Speaker 3  18:08
No, I'm well, I could probably go, not dig for emails and things and get clear on it. But right now, it's one of those things I haven't thought about in months.

Speaker 1  18:22
Well, is it, is it worth looking at now, or should we look at it next week? I mean, we're not at a point where we're ready to do that, but

Unknown Speaker  18:29
yeah, we might as well just wait.

Speaker 1  18:34
I guess we gotta make a note to look at it next next month and next week.

Speaker 3  18:39
Just, I we don't. We don't have a function at all where we can keep people from making change like, like a partial closing function. Do we?

Matthias Miller  18:55
We do? Don't we a lot of locked period versus the closing with permissions, if we can edit the lock preview,

Speaker 3  19:04
yeah, I thought, because we should maybe get that engaged here fairly soon, so that, so that, like, just general processing, isn't I mean, I've been, I've been fixing dates on stuff that I found. But, like, I don't know at this point, they probably still need to go back to 24

Speaker 1  19:27
a little bit well. I mean, I think it might be worth a few minutes to take a look at that, at what we have, the functionality that, yeah, was built. So

Speaker 4  19:37
I just found, I mean, I'm not familiar with this, but I just found that we have a I just search for period. We have option to close period, lock period, and then we have, you can look at accounting periods for a company. It looks like there's nothing set up at this point.

Matthias Miller  19:53
It also looks like there's no permission. There's permissions to i. Lock, close and reopen post, but not to edit. Well there, but not to edit. Lots. Sorry, locking is not to edit locked transactions. I wonder if we wouldn't want to do something like, I don't know. I mean, that's a Joel, probably Joel and Ellis question, Are they comfortable with that? But seems to me like,

Speaker 3  20:28
but there, there is a permission for locking and unlocking the period, right?

Matthias Miller  20:35
Yeah, that, but it locks everybody out, right?

Speaker 3  20:39
So, I mean, once we're say, Okay, we don't want anybody messing with that unless we're doing closing transactions, we could just lock it. And then when we're ready to do closing transactions, just open it up again and right, do them if we would want to do it that way, right? Nobody does anything janky just then.

Speaker 1  21:02
So but, okay, closing dates and locking dates. Can you explain the difference again, on those again, it's been too long.

Matthias Miller  21:17
I mean, is there any difference between just two layers on top of each other, and intention of how they're used. I mean, closing would typically be, let's close out the period. Locking is, I mean, you might want to lock like you get to June, you might want to say, hey, I want to lock everything through April. Like nobody should be going back that far, but it but you didn't actually close the transaction. Said he would have to probably check, or your I would have to check to see whether there's actually, does it mean anything more than that?

Speaker 3  21:48
Well, wait, I don't, if I remember correctly, it doesn't. I mean, I think we were thinking essentially, they actually do the same thing. But closing is thinking like in an annual closing, like we found on this. Whereas locking is just a periodic we don't want anybody to make changes back beyond or up to this point, right?

Speaker 1  22:13
Oh, your understanding was they, they both do the exact same thing? Well, that would be, I mean, I think looking ahead in 25 we didn't do any of that in 24 because seems there was constantly things that we needed to go back, you know, close to the year and make some changes. But I think what Matthias said would be, it would save us some some work on applying actual costs and things like that, because it like we would now know that those numbers would change. Do you know how to use this? As far as the locking and closing, I haven't seen it. Could we just do a quick, I don't know, just

Unknown Speaker  22:57
just close 2023, for us. I

Matthias Miller  23:05
see, oh, there. Maybe you can't

Unknown Speaker  23:06
even do that.

Matthias Miller  23:15
What all does, you know? Does the scrutiny like to do this? It might be somewhat interesting to know what it does First, I would say, so, yeah, I look okay, it looks like it's just,

Speaker 4  23:31
it is. Well, here it's just adding the closing period.

Matthias Miller  23:38
Well, I mean, that's

Speaker 4  23:41
fair. I so unless we have, like, other code that sees, there's a closing period, and goes and does stuff,

Matthias Miller  23:51
I can't I don't expand it. It's old enough. I can't imagine there's any kind of fancy magic, Okay, fair enough. Do you want me to I think what we wanted to do is we wanted to make it hard for people to reverse anyway. We just wanted to make it. There would have been other ways to do it, but this is simple. Yeah, I'm happy. Should

Unknown Speaker  24:11
I run it?

Matthias Miller  24:12
Yeah? Yep, you would just risk that life is fun, but not so much that it gets you into trouble, too, too much trouble, 24 maybe, or 20

Unknown Speaker  24:24
I thought they said 23 Oh, that's fine, yeah,

Matthias Miller  24:27
yeah.

Speaker 1  24:30
I wish we'd be at 20 ready to do 24 but we're not well. So that was

Matthias Miller  24:37
so now find the 23 transaction. I But the

Speaker 1  24:44
behavior would probably be somewhat different on 23 transactions, since they weren't those somewhat locked already because of

Matthias Miller  24:53
Yeah, accounting impact wouldn't push over, but the transaction itself weren't locked. So somebody could have gone in and manually changed them, yeah. I mean, we, we should have done this, but there you go.

Speaker 3  25:07
Okay, so you just get that and say, okay, bummer. Be that way. Then,

Matthias Miller  25:16
good. Is

Speaker 1  25:18
there anything else we should look at, I mean, your, your thought Drew is that moving forward, we would use maybe 90 days after the period ends. We, we could lock that period, yeah, and then, I mean, border layer, we could, yeah, probably

Unknown Speaker  25:35
whatever we whatever deems functional. Yeah,

Speaker 1  25:40
good. I think that's all on that through your email. That was all resolved later. I think then that was just old stuff.

Unknown Speaker  25:57
Are you in the use tax law? No,

Speaker 1  26:00
the one on special transaction pipes for assets or unless you have something more that I found an email later. Except that was right,

Speaker 3  26:15
we had, yeah, so if you had sent an email back that you had found something to fix it, I believe.

Speaker 1  26:28
Okay, good. So then moving to handling retrievals, let's just shelve that until we're done with 24 books, unless there's you okay with that? Dwayne,

Matthias Miller  26:48
yep. Okay.

Speaker 1  26:52
So I don't know all of these fit in the paper cut projects or not, but the asset management improved. They put in service for linking to an invoice, payment, record or transaction. Let's just,

Speaker 3  27:06
well, there's a whole bunch of assets that are put in service as of 1231 I know

Speaker 1  27:10
1231 24 now, now we're bumping up against, yeah, them and Dwayne's. People are constantly, you know, unable to link to assets because of that. So

Speaker 3  27:21
services go in there and move them all. I figured, well, then by then we'd have that straightened out.

Speaker 1  27:26
We we, we could. I moved a few, but I want to see what it takes to make this change. And if it's something Seth can do, you know, easily, then I'd say we just go ahead and remove the date put in service. But Seth, does it make sense? Well, what I'm what I put together or not.

Unknown Speaker  27:51
Oh, the invoice,

Matthias Miller  27:53
basically

Speaker 1  27:56
the your, your drop down list that appears as available assets to link to that list is, from what I can tell, is working exactly like we would expect it to, but it's it'll allow you to select an asset that does not have a date put in service, but when you go to save the invoice or say the sales order, you have It tied to payment record, it won't allow you to save it because,

Unknown Speaker  28:30
so is the easiest thing to just I don't know. Look at at a few examples. Maybe,

Speaker 4  28:40
sure, I'm trying to see what so you're saying, you can set it, but then when you save it's grumpy at you.

Speaker 1  28:53
Yeah, it might, it might be easier if you just are easiest if you just go to, I don't know, go to shed time and open an invoice and we try to link it to one of those assets. Sure.

Speaker 1  29:14
Um, uh, actually, before you do that, go to, wow. Okay, let's we can open an invoice, but then also, uh, assets, or Yeah, and let's find one asset and just remove the the date put in service, good. All the way at the bottom, there's a shed time office, or towards the bottom, about the fourth one, yeah, pick that one and then edit it and remove the date put in service. Because typically when we when we initially create can't remove it. Okay? Because it has depreciated already. Okay? Well, what we want to do,

Speaker 1  30:11
what's what's ideal, is we create the asset, but at that point, we don't know exactly when it's going to be put in service yet, and we leave that blank. Do it. I guess we could, for the sake of this test. Okay, I think it'll, it'll still allow you to, well, I tried it this morning. I had taken out the pizza

Speaker 4  30:42
so you don't have to have a date put in service, unless it has depreciation, or it's marked as sold. If it has depreciation, then you can't,

Speaker 1  30:58
okay, just, let's create a new asset, just for the sake of this test, then just just create something. Just get rid of it. Afterwards,

Unknown Speaker  31:08
Mark's new mug.

Speaker 1  31:13
I always like that story on how this one company, how they tried to cook the quality. Did they they wanted to make the books look real good and to increase their profit date. They rated assets for everything and appreciated things like paper and pens stuff and so they had very little expenses, because it was all spread out over many years.

Unknown Speaker  31:45
Wow. Okay, so just,

Unknown Speaker  31:54
can you save it like that? I mean, that's all the information

Speaker 4  31:58
I need to count. Okay, just office equipment. The

Unknown Speaker  32:04
Yeah, the 12, the one, yeah, that one.

Unknown Speaker  32:09
There we go. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  32:12
yeah, now, now go to an invoice and try it linking it to this asset. I any invoice, yeah, you can just, just as long as we don't save it and then in it has to be non purchase order expense, right? You can't link, um, I don't want,

Speaker 1  32:40
yeah, like, change that account. Change the GL account to Oh, okay, it'll, it'll, yeah, try selecting that and, yeah, see, say, see if we can save that? Okay, yep, no,

Matthias Miller  33:10
okay, you guys want to go through the specific ones that you guys are trying to link, blink

Speaker 1  33:15
of. Well, we could, I mean, I just, I just put ones at random as well, and didn't even

Speaker 3  33:23
so go back to that, what's what's different about that asset?

Speaker 4  33:29
It doesn't have depreciation on it yet, so you don't have to have the date. But in service,

Speaker 1  33:38
what I discovered through is, if you put okay. The criteria that it's using is, if you, if it has no date put in service, or the date put in service is is equal to or greater than, like the invoice date or the payment date, basically the transaction date. It will allow you to select it which is correct, and if, if it's less than that, it won't. Well, this looks like like, but so if you have,

Speaker 3  34:13
what, oh, pull the ass, put it, give it an asset class that would have depreciation. What? Like? Well, I guess office

Unknown Speaker  34:26
for nature would have, yeah,

Speaker 3  34:32
and then probably once we would hook an initial one up. Is that going to set

Speaker 4  34:35
degree? It looks like it's planning to do depreciation next month already. But

Speaker 1  34:45
would it do depreciation? If we like typical procedures, we would leave that date put in service blank for anywhere from one to six, seven months, and then we would set it so if we just leave that. Saying it won't automatically to depreciation.

Unknown Speaker  35:04
Well, I'm wondering

Unknown Speaker  35:11
transaction asset class out.

Speaker 1  35:17
Well, I was hoping we could set up everything, everything but,

Unknown Speaker  35:29
but the date put in service until then. But

Speaker 3  35:33
if the date put in service, we would function as a stop on the whole depreciation thing. You know, if we haven't reached the input and service, whatever's the information in the depreciation section, is not going to happen.

Speaker 4  35:52
I think we're actually fine. Okay, I think this will exclude it from Are you sure

Matthias Miller  36:00
in range today. Nana, Oh, does this go? Is this? Na, I mean, the put in service would be sort of useful life would be this one's. Na, Oh, I see. And they as well, which means that so waiting it should turn any past attorney, future, yeah, recruiting, recruiting depreciation appears to be creating, well, run a report. Can you write a report to pull transactions linked to an asset where the asset is not, well, I mean, we don't have to do it now, but,

Speaker 1  36:46
well, I think, I don't know if we could check that, but I think for affordable we have an asset or two that have not yet been put in service and have been that way for, you know, across the end of the month, we could see if that, well, keep going with this. But our old ones might work, like the ones that we had dated out to the 3124 those now have depreciation, so I think the only way to make those really work is bump out the bump out the date. But moving forward, we should be able to

Matthias Miller  37:23
here, except you can do a

Unknown Speaker  37:26
message. You do, we have an index on it. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  37:29
we do. I've got it right here. If you do, just do that index and do it in all keys. Gotcha?

Speaker 1  37:42
Yeah, other thing too, it looks like all of this up here is is working correctly, but moving forward, but

Matthias Miller  37:49
this mind,

Speaker 1  37:52
never mind. Are we linking assets anywhere other than like so payment dates and vendors, and

Matthias Miller  37:57
then we want to see if it has our G account, transplant account, where the asset field

Speaker 1  38:05
on the transactions. We're getting it completely different

Speaker 3  38:10
setups like, well, it's just listed, I think it goes by the asset ID instead of the asset name. I'd like to drop down, uses the name, and it shows both. It

Matthias Miller  38:20
gives Where is an A

Speaker 1  38:22
that gives us all the NA or, regardless of whether, don't you want

Speaker 4  38:27
to just check that the transaction date is

Unknown Speaker  38:31
good, I think, like, do you want transactions

Matthias Miller  38:34
where it's not in service? Oh,

Speaker 4  38:36
you mean, don't you want it where? Yeah, yeah, yeah, the transaction wasn't in service, or it wasn't in service. As of the transaction, I just it didn't

Speaker 3  38:45
bother me, because I know they're not going to be writing well,

Matthias Miller  38:48
except this is

Speaker 1  38:50
not worth touching, but you're the only you and I are probably the only ones that are probably,

Matthias Miller  38:54
because you're going to want to see if,

Speaker 3  38:55
I mean, if it's easy, yeah, yeah, altering, then, yeah, that's probably three minutes, yeah?

Unknown Speaker  39:08
Unless there you go to make adjustments,

Unknown Speaker  39:11
yeah, we have a few of those. Well,

Speaker 3  39:13
you know, what if we what if we create a transaction? What if we want to

Matthias Miller  39:18
create transactions?

Speaker 4  39:21
I got some. Are these, if you would do a repeater s. These aren't depreciation, though. Trying to think, if we

Unknown Speaker  39:30
want to good point,

Matthias Miller  39:34
maybe we should just leave the repeat on the account transaction line, account that you can see

Unknown Speaker  39:39
what account it is. Yeah, well,

Unknown Speaker  39:41
here, how about we do this?

Speaker 3  39:48
I mean, I think it could all be done through the different options on the asset. Wow, but might be good to go through an asset. Of assessment before we just say that's not going to happen.

Speaker 1  40:05
Yeah, which we want to we're looking at those. What are the

Matthias Miller  40:20
what are the numbers for depreciation? If you sort my account names,

Unknown Speaker  40:27
something like that,

Speaker 1  40:31
wow, the 1208 are the Oh acid, right? Or they're, it doesn't?

Unknown Speaker  40:42
Here's one depreciation,

Speaker 1  40:44
yeah, they're scattered all throughout, isn't there? Okay,

Unknown Speaker  40:48
is depreciation always in the

Speaker 3  40:51
well, there's asset there's ones that are asset accounts and ones that are expense accounts, depending

Speaker 1  40:57
what it is, but depreciation always in the name, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  41:01
it always says, then I think this is the only

Matthias Miller  41:05
name. Or is it ever the parent name?

Unknown Speaker  41:10
Don't always

Unknown Speaker  41:15
this is the only one it's finding, unless we're missing something. I

Matthias Miller  41:20
Well, 3120, business, but in service, end of next year, end of this year.

Speaker 4  41:29
Well, we have that just changed, though. It was done correctly. I think we're fine, because this transaction was created before that was modified on the first 12 days before it was modified.

Speaker 1  41:50
And the the only reason, maybe there's a better way, but the only reason we, we, I moved that date out is so they can continue adding.

Matthias Miller  42:01
Yeah, but should we, we should at least void that, that depreciation transaction, shouldn't we?

Speaker 1  42:14
Yeah. I mean, will we have unintended consequences if we, if we do that? Because, I mean, yeah, the answer is yes, we should. But there's going to be a number of those where we set up the asset and said, we'll put it in service, 1231, 24 we just moved it to a date in the future so we could add link transactions to that asset, and then we cross that date. Didn't realize what's happening, and it started to depreciate. So,

Speaker 1  42:54
I mean, you're basically saying, If we change, if the date put in service changes, then void those depreciation transactions. I think that would be correct. I mean, moving forward, we won't have that anymore. This was just kind of, yeah. I

Speaker 3  43:23
if we, if we go put that date, put in service back, it will just start calculating appreciation from like, at the next month, right? I'm pretty sure we tested that like, it'll just say, like, you move the date and service back, so that the end point is still correct. And then I'll say, Okay, we got so many months left and zero has been depreciated. So split it out.

Speaker 1  43:50
Actually, what, what would be the most ideal here is if we provide you with a list of, here's all the assets that actually are not in service yet. So clear, clear the date put in service. Just leave that blank. And then any depreciation transactions that have already happened, just reverse those. Would that be? I mean, there's probably 20 assets like that. Would that be? Then, that way we would be starting,

Unknown Speaker  44:25
we would no longer have to do this, push the date put in service out there's a future date, and then at the right time, you know, edit it to you

Speaker 1  44:46
or like this. This the asset we were looking at this. She had time office. What we really want to do is say, Well, this one's not in service yet. We have two options. One, we can move the date put in service out to some you. Just some future date so that we can keep attaching invoices to it. Or what we would rather do is just have a way to just provide that list to you, and you would say, wow. Okay, this just clear the date put in service and reverse the transactions. Is that? How hard would that be? I Are you? Am I making sense on what I'm looking for?

Speaker 4  45:33
Are you just waiting to manually clear them or,

Speaker 1  45:39
yeah, I mean, if we would have a way to manually clear them, that would be, well, can't

Speaker 4  45:43
you? Can't you just void the depreciation transactions and and clear the date put in service?

Unknown Speaker  45:54
I would think so. And

Speaker 1  45:55
can we, can we blur the date put in service? Does it just get

Speaker 4  46:01
it gives you an error if you have accumulated depreciation, but if you don't have any of those, if those transactions are all voided, you should be able to clear it. Okay?

Unknown Speaker  46:09
I think, yeah.

Speaker 1  46:11
So void the transactions, then go the date, and all is good.

Speaker 4  46:15
I think so. Matthias, am I missing something?

Matthias Miller  46:19
I don't think so. I mean, I would try it, and if you run into issues, come back to us. But I think it should work. I don't know I wouldn't, but

Speaker 3  46:28
so and you have something like you're taking care of making so that we can put the depreciation information in, and if there is no date put in service, it just won't calculate until the date put in service,

Speaker 4  46:39
right? Well, I don't think it is okay.

Unknown Speaker  46:43
You're saying is okay, okay.

Speaker 1  46:47
Well, we can, we can watch it like February 1 or second. We can look and see, you know, the ones that are blank over that time, if they

Speaker 4  46:57
I mean, I could bulletproof it, just to make sure

Unknown Speaker  47:04
I'm fine with just, well, you know, looking at it and verifying

Matthias Miller  47:13
I'm gonna say SAS proposal makes me happy. So

Speaker 4  47:18
it's like a few minutes change. Okay, it does. Doesn't happen.

Speaker 1  47:25
Good. So while we've come full circle on that, I would consider this incident done. Then with we verified that it's working moving forward, and you explain to us how to resolve the ones that we need to resolve. So and that last part about linking to transaction, just ignore that for right now. So I'm going to consider this done, and we'll let you know if there's other other things. Problem is that good? Sounds Yep,

Unknown Speaker  48:01
sounds good. Okay.

Speaker 1  48:09
So two was just a question, utilizing asset groups for managing data. Is there any downside to utilizing asset groups to help companies better manage their data on assets? So we created it for just as a way to manage combine projects that have different classes, like a cell storage facility was, was the initial intent. But is there any reason why we couldn't, like, make whatever groups we want? Say, Yeah, make a group for forklifts, one for shed trailers, or whatever the groups are, and just put those assets within that group. I could think of a reason not to, but

Matthias Miller  48:57
asset groups have no functional impact. It's just descriptive. So you guys can create one for each asset, for for all we care, whatever. The one stipulation is, you have to use asset groups to make you happy.

Speaker 1  49:12
Well, at this, this whole asset management thing, is a good example of if you build something well, it can end up being used for a lot of other things you never intended to be useful and that we're using it for a number of other things. So

Speaker 3  49:30
on the asset group things, um, so if we sell an entire group, So case in point is these, is these self storage units. So if we sell the Self Storage unit as the turnkey, then in our gain and loss and sale of asset transaction like I have to sell each transaction separate, each group, each asset separately. And then I and then I create a zeroing line so that then I move them all to one, you know, all the minor ones. I actually zero those transactions and then move it over so it's all reflect the gain and loss is all reflected on the main asset. But would there be a way that we could, you know, maybe give grouping a functionality.

Matthias Miller  50:28
I mean, you can also just manually create your sales transaction, new transaction for sale of abandoned. But how would this work

Speaker 3  50:40
market, yeah, because you just mark it sold, then it doesn't actually do anything

Matthias Miller  50:45
to the I mean, it's all based on the your what is this called? One that you did should be looking down sale. Begin to mint. Yeah. I mean, I think it's actually pretty simple we could create. I think it's actually pretty simple to do what you're proposing. Seth, we could. There's this auto push, create, sale, abandonment, transaction that prompts an asset ID if we would prompt for multiple assets when we let's see Link actions when we generate the I mean, we had to change the report then to iterate over all of the Make sure it's all the same company. Iterate over all the accounts for all the assets and just populate based off of that. Let's see devas credits count. About create the first line, then the asset book value and we assign. I mean, here's what I would say, giant step. Okay, Is it doable? Absolutely, it's doable. Is it? Is it a couple hours? I mean, I mean, probably I don't know something like that. Big picture, if you guys are trying to be conscientious about spending right now, I would say this is a luxury that you shouldn't but that's me making the decision for you. You guys are welcome to do what you want. It just seems like there's no reason why you can't click, click, click, click, click, have all your tabs open and go recreate the master transaction and put them all into one or or

Speaker 3  52:31
so. But I didn't you're done. Yeah, I didn't think about just combining them all into one and then going and marking them all sold without creating a sale of asset for each individual.

Matthias Miller  52:48
As far as I know, I'm not aware of, yeah, all right, any reason why can

Speaker 1  52:53
sale of transaction or whatever, you would just mark them sold and then do a transaction

Speaker 3  53:00
that, and in that big single transaction, you could select those, those assets. So I think, yeah, I think that works.

Speaker 1  53:10
I think your suggestion is, is real good with us, because we're going to use this three, four times a year, maybe at most. I We're on assets, let's jump to I send out an incident later, after the agenda went out. I think it's pretty basic, but you guys have that, or it's also, I can give you the incident number. If that's easier,

Speaker 4  53:46
I think I have the asset management report.

Speaker 1  53:50
Yeah, yeah. So, okay, the first question was, can we add notes, a note section, to an asset? This would primarily use for identification purposes when reviewing the list of assets. So right now, when we look at our list of assets, you know, it's like, well, what is this asset actually? Which forklift is this or whatever? If we could add notes that would say, you know, the old yellow clunker that was bought at the machinery auction, you know, in 2012 when we start, or whatever, then it would that would be helpful when we're looking at that

Matthias Miller  54:26
in purchasing documents. Would you, would you be okay calling it a description and having it be a single line, plain text field, yeah, or would you,

Unknown Speaker  54:39
can we put documents in.

Matthias Miller  54:43
I would, I would, if you want documents, I would propose we have something else, a separate section for notes themselves, where you put the documentation in. I think you have two separate things you're wanting to do. One is, okay, looking at the report and seeing, Oh, there's a file attachment for. Or you purchase that PDF, that's not really helpful. I think you're you're trying to have there's two different pieces of information you're trying to track, and I would vote to separate them.

Speaker 1  55:11
Well, I think the purchase attachment, though, could be helpful in its own way, because, like a lot of these, everything bought prior to 24 those, like the invoices and stuff, are still in QuickBooks, so it would be helpful to, like, take those attachments and attach them to the assets, so that we're, if we're looking at old stuff, we're like, Okay, where was this bought? But would you still do the the description and then allow for an attachment as well. Correct.

Matthias Miller  55:41
My point is, you don't care in the report what the attachments are. That doesn't help you at the report.

Speaker 1  55:47
You're true. Yeah, yeah, I would, yeah. If you go to the asset management report, I think that would be the most helpful. That's kind of where we're I don't know if you just want to share your screen. And we kind of look at what we could do there. I

Matthias Miller  56:17
it pulled it up, sir, am I? Yeah, I'm getting it. Come on. Unless you want to go for it.

Speaker 1  56:28
So basically, the proposal I have here is we leave we add three columns to this report, after name, we add notes or prescription, and then after book value, we show monthly depreciation and we also show purchase costs. This only shows book value, so if we would, I'm pretty sure monthly depreciation purchase costs are easy to add.

Unknown Speaker  56:57
No Dwayne, what are you I mean, okay, the other thing we could do, I guess maybe this is kind of

Speaker 1  57:06
okay, why don't we just make the name more descriptive and call it a day? I mean, is there notes full All right? Like, why couldn't we just do that? Like, if the name doesn't tell us what we need, need to know, we just, well, okay, the name is what we're calling it on the tax basis. So what Whitney's calling it like on her so it probably would make her sad if we change that, it would be confusing. I think if we What's your thought? Matthias on adding a description like a

Matthias Miller  57:54
I'm in favor. I think it's great. I don't have any I don't have any problem with it. We could rename, well, I said, yeah, let me concede conceivably, we could also move the name over into the ID and have that be but, but I think you use the ID for other purposes as well. Or you could extend the ID to say, you know, have the ID dash the name,

Matthias Miller  58:31
something like,

Speaker 2  58:33
I think Matthias is hesitating, because the moment you add description box, I'm going to ask for it to be RTF, so it can be, we can use it for all kinds of fun stuff. Well, I mean,

Matthias Miller  58:45
here, let me do this, if you have some semblance of an imagination. If not, I apologize.

Matthias Miller  59:00
We could do something like, like this. Oh,

Unknown Speaker  59:06
we so we already have that

Unknown Speaker  59:10
popping together. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  59:12
I'm just making it something that you can imagine.

Matthias Miller  59:21
Mix case. That's what it is.

Matthias Miller  59:29
I mean, imagine, imagine something more like this. What do you think of this?

Speaker 1  59:35
And then you would change just Okay, on the acid itself, you'd have two fields, one for the ID and one for the name, and it would come on this report. It would combine them, but then you would have a description where you could, sorry,

Matthias Miller  59:46
no, we would, we would update. We would keep the fields, we would change the IDs. We would take what currently is the name and put it in the ID. And then we'd actually here, let's this is actually more real. Stick of what it would look like. We change your assets, give it a new ID. Your ID would become that, and your report would look like this. And then you could fill in a name for the descriptive purposes.

Speaker 4  1:00:19
Doesn't that still cause problem for who was it that we said earlier was using the name

Speaker 1  1:00:27
Pax mountain? Yeah, that's, that's probably, is that? Was that your hesitation? Well,

Speaker 3  1:00:31
no part of my hesitation is, then we get a very long in like indicator of what this thing is, and then it doesn't all show up in in the field.

Matthias Miller  1:00:47
Okay? I mean, I'm pretty happy adding and adding a keeping as is adding a description, adding a separate notes field for you guys to throw in file attachments, and Duane can put in pretty pictures in red text.

Speaker 2  1:01:00
It's more, it's more like if, if. Well, I mean, I don't live over in accounting world, but if I had an asset class record, I would want to be attaching backing documents

Unknown Speaker  1:01:09
to it, right? That's what I'm concerned about. But

Speaker 1  1:01:12
we don't necessarily need it for new things, because we're linking to the the invoice or the but it's for old stuff. We would, yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:01:20
but maybe there's a handwritten something or other titles, who knows or another or something.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:28
There's always

Matthias Miller  1:01:30
something. So

Speaker 1  1:01:34
then I would vote to change the name. We currently have to call that tax bases. Tax basis name. And then, I don't know you have name or company name, tax basis name,

Matthias Miller  1:01:51
uh, I'll mark this uh, descriptive name, yeah. And then, and then in your drop list, do you want to be using the descriptive name instead of the tax basis name? Or do you want it all to be in there?

Unknown Speaker  1:02:10
Not all.

Speaker 3  1:02:13
I would say, keep the keep the tax basis name, because that's what they're going to be using to select it. And we don't want people have to try to write that same description down when they're saying, hey, put it on this asset, you know, the old Plunker, because they're going to call it different things if it doesn't have a specific

Speaker 4  1:02:35
I think so. Why are we renaming? I'm just like, is it actually used in the software as a tax basis name.

Speaker 1  1:02:45
No, we're we're exporting, okay, so everything prior to 20, all of these assets that were purchased in 20, prior to 24 we had never, had always been managed in a tax basis software. And so the names, all of the names are that that's what our tax account uses to identify these assets. So that's why we want to keep those names intact and call them okay at the and then we'll export this list of assets to her and say, okay, as of 1231, 24 here is our current list of assets. And then she puts it into her tax basis depreciation software, which is and determines, you know, what we can depreciate, which is completely different from book basis that we're using it.

Speaker 3  1:03:47
So argument just as just ID and Name, and I

Speaker 4  1:03:52
would argue to keep it as ID, Name and Description, I think it's going to get conf the user. The interface gets more confusing as we start adding things like or to me at least, it would seem like you'd get more confused if you had tax basis to that when it's functionally in the software, at least it's not. It's, I mean, I think name is a pretty reasonable descriptor of it. So in our drop list, we will show ID and Name description you don't expect to show up in a drop list that just shows up on reports and on the record?

Speaker 1  1:04:24
Yeah. I mean, I like that. I think that's good.

Matthias Miller  1:04:30
The other argument too is, this is a generic This is a core accounting system feature. I think it's an add on, but it's core accounting feature, and for other companies, ID, name, description makes a lot of sense. All

Speaker 1  1:04:44
right, you happy, yeah, is this pretty straightforward to do?

Matthias Miller  1:04:52
Okay? Yeah, it's yeah, it's fast.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:55
Did we have an apple pie with that?

Matthias Miller  1:04:59
Yeah? Death says it's fast. The truth is, Seth is fast.

Speaker 1  1:05:05
Wow. I didn't know how to respond to that, but that was what I was looking you said it's fast, but it all depends who's doing it. I But good, let's look at four and five, because I think that we may spend a little time on three. So for accounting impact, for use tax Drew. You had some feedback on your email? Do you want to go through that? I

Matthias Miller  1:05:50
number one was fixed, wasn't it? I think so.

Speaker 3  1:05:58
Well, okay, so this was Friday, the 20th of December.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:05
Well, okay, that's when you send it to me to

Speaker 3  1:06:07
add to the agenda, right? So I'm wondering, and

Unknown Speaker  1:06:11
you send it to I don't

Speaker 3  1:06:13
think so, um, because transaction tax payment. Excellent sales tax liability account.

Matthias Miller  1:06:27
We did not fix that until till the 26th So, and we haven't had an update since. You need to go ask Josh for an update to fix your number one. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:42
No, no updates since

Matthias Miller  1:06:46
16th of December.

Speaker 1  1:06:51
Wow. So can you or can you see when the last update was you? Can you

Unknown Speaker  1:06:55
it looks like it was updated the 11th,

Matthias Miller  1:07:00
so, January, oh, I was looking at the test system. Okay, so, yeah, the test system hasn't

Unknown Speaker  1:07:05
been updated in a long time here.

Matthias Miller  1:07:07
Let me, let me show you

Speaker 3  1:07:08
this should be taken care of. Well, I guess I'll find out just shortly here, probably, so

Matthias Miller  1:07:13
it's under admin general,

Unknown Speaker  1:07:18
about indeed, is what I was, yeah, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:07:19
yeah.

Speaker 1  1:07:23
Okay. So one is, is fakes completed? You're going to be doing

Speaker 3  1:07:30
sales tax shortly here, yeah, yeah. So as long as we have something with you, stacks, we should, yeah, Find that out. The next one is just skip I

Speaker 3  1:08:05
number three is the that's that Brian Lloyd building, if you pull up that so number i i

Matthias Miller  1:08:27
switch to use tags you want

Matthias Miller  1:08:34
To pull up your screen. Yeah, I'm switching.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:42
Slowly come in.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:48
Okay, so,

Matthias Miller  1:08:54
enable, use, hacks,

Unknown Speaker  1:09:01
Save, then go look at why

Matthias Miller  1:09:03
is raw materials cost not editable? Shouldn't it be? It pulls

Speaker 3  1:09:09
it from the building, or, suppose that's right, nevermind. Supposed to base the use tax on the building,

Matthias Miller  1:09:15
right? Okay, so then if you save, I he or if you can,

Unknown Speaker  1:09:26
okay, so what company is this

Unknown Speaker  1:09:31
thorn in the blood?

Speaker 1  1:09:38
They're doing, I think, seven or nine final

Unknown Speaker  1:09:42
structures.

Speaker 3  1:09:44
So the first one's working out for the guy. Then, I guess, or else, he's just spending money

Speaker 1  1:09:52
this project once before. And then he said it pretty quickly, investors, what I.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:01
So that's what it's doing.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:03
Well, rentals, I think so I'm not

Speaker 4  1:10:18
get one of those around here. Nope, it's not in here

Unknown Speaker  1:10:24
that you couldn't keep

Speaker 4  1:10:28
it. Is it that the right vendor?

Unknown Speaker  1:10:32
Yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:10:42
You said it's not showing up in the

Unknown Speaker  1:10:44
No,

Unknown Speaker  1:10:54
some of that's not gonna get

Speaker 3  1:11:01
I get just sent off sales tax. This will see Valley

Speaker 4  1:11:15
13, oh, this was, this isn't going to be included in sales tax because it was invoiced before we started tracking. Sales tax was invoiced and, yeah, because it was

Speaker 3  1:11:31
right. So that's why it should, or I guess, does that mean that it doesn't have the functionality for calculating use tax. God,

Speaker 4  1:11:45
okay, because we're only including stuff that was invoiced after we started doing sales tax. So

Speaker 3  1:11:52
like, so, yeah, this was in August. So anything that's before, what was it October? I think it was first of October. They use tax calculating functionality, yeah, got it,

Unknown Speaker  1:12:09
yeah, first of October, okay,

Speaker 3  1:12:19
then that's fine. Is there a way to, well, okay, kind of just switch it back to what it was.

Matthias Miller  1:12:33
If you

Speaker 3  1:12:34
manually manipulate this, set it for sales tax and manually manipulate it to make it go, make it zero out the invoice. Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 4  1:12:51
So may I put it back to what it was? There something

Speaker 3  1:12:54
else you're running? No, okay, that's, that's what I need to know. Okay, yep, do

Speaker 3  1:13:06
number four, do you know if that was just somebody entered it wrong, or did the system do something

Unknown Speaker  1:13:19
wrong? More just I mean, we're going to have errors, but making them, that's one plus.

Matthias Miller  1:13:34
So

Speaker 3  1:13:37
like, it's correct now, or, I mean, unless something changed it, but so

Unknown Speaker  1:13:41
it wasn't,

Unknown Speaker  1:13:45
it was in Iredale,

Speaker 4  1:13:47
yeah, wait, no, it is in Iredale. Oh, are we it was in, okay, yeah, Pittsylvania,

Speaker 3  1:14:01
wow. And it goes from Virginia to North Carolina, even,

Matthias Miller  1:14:05
like, let me

Matthias Miller  1:14:12
see, where did it get? So the first time, that's what I'm so

Speaker 4  1:14:18
tax County. It was manually set,

Unknown Speaker  1:14:26
okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:14:30
so it was not the system,

Unknown Speaker  1:14:33
but it was put in as,

Speaker 4  1:14:36
oh yeah. It was put in as this, and then you fixed it.

Speaker 3  1:14:39
Yeah, okay, yeah, okay, good. I mean, not good that it was just made wrong, but good. That is not the system,

Speaker 4  1:14:49
but it's better if it's manually made wrong than the system just randomly goofs up. Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 3  1:14:56
Well, it didn't match any of the address. Oh. And so it's and so the rate was, was all wrong for the category that it showed up

Speaker 1  1:15:11
good. So five, if I remember correctly, Matthias, this was one that had fractional parts of a zero, which is why it was showing up on an AI report. We were gonna without telling or without boring us or subjecting us all the details on fractional parts of a sin. He said it was something that was, yeah, I think that's a story on that.

Matthias Miller  1:15:40
It's it's the we did some research, and unfortunately, because of how computers handle numbers close to the fractional numbers close to zero, or differences close to zero, something like that was showing up as a mic. We weren't recognizing it as almost a zero, and so I had put in a round in this case to fix it. And so if it ever happens again, where something's not, I don't know, is he did put the round in. Then, yeah, I did okay. So it should be,

Speaker 1  1:16:21
hey, it should be good. Now, do you do a round for this one specifically, or for for all of them moving forward?

Matthias Miller  1:16:30
So no, I mean, it was, let me, let me see exactly how it was. Anytime we calculate the amount owed, whether for recurrent or historical day we round,

Unknown Speaker  1:16:45
which should resolve,

Matthias Miller  1:16:47
okay, yeah,

Speaker 4  1:16:49
it was off. We were like within point five times 10 to the negative 11th of it being at the threshold for zero, but not quite

Unknown Speaker  1:17:02
the that's almost zero.

Speaker 1  1:17:08
Good. So if we go to three encrypting confidential information, what would it take to encrypt confidential information like So Social Security numbers and maybe ein numbers on contact records,

Matthias Miller  1:17:25
well encrypted? How? I guess encryption has a lot of meanings anywhere from we're checking a box for compliance, and it doesn't actually mean anything to, yeah,

Speaker 4  1:17:41
what? What we've done for another system with Social Security and EIN is we give, okay, we store two things. We store the full social and only a few people have permission to view that. We don't track activity history. We and then we store. What we did for them is we stored the last four as well, and we're allowing more people to view that. And then when we get test systems and stuff, we scrub it all. I don't know if you I don't know if you would need the last four visible one second.

Speaker 4  1:18:22
Yeah, don't know if you all would need to store the last four or not.

Matthias Miller  1:18:28
You could also take it one step further, which is probably overkill, but this is because of me and my wondering mind. There would be a way to have it be password protected, where in order to even see the value, you would have to edit the edit the screen, type in a password and go pull out the value. But it basically prohibits you from running any kind of exports to you know, it's real overkill. You probably don't want to do that.

Unknown Speaker  1:19:00
Well,

Unknown Speaker  1:19:01
well,

Speaker 3  1:19:04
Dwayne, what was you all's concern on the I mean, didn't it include, you know, hacking type of things, more than, more than just users taking the information, you know?

Speaker 2  1:19:26
No, I think that's mostly like just users taking the information once you have, once you got somebody social security number, you can do some fun stuff.

Matthias Miller  1:19:34
Yeah, can I make an observation? Is it Leanna stakeholder here?

Unknown Speaker  1:19:40
Yeah, she was the one that brought this up.

Matthias Miller  1:19:42
So could we? Is she available that she could, I mean, if she's a stakeholder, can we have a part of the conversation? Or am I,

Speaker 3  1:19:52
like, I mean, I really don't know anything about hacking. But as far as, I mean, just. Simply making so that viewing viewing social security numbers. You know, if you have to type in a password to be able to view social security numbers, or even just make it a user level thing where they're just not visible, if you're on this user level, and if you're on this user level, they are visible like that would take care of that part, but that doesn't keep somebody from hacking into the system and hauling off with you know,

Speaker 2  1:20:31
information should, should be on in a minute. Okay, okay,

Speaker 1  1:20:35
you probably run into the same thing Dwayne with rent to own, don't you? I mean,

Speaker 2  1:20:48
yeah, except that we went away from storing social security numbers as part of our to contract so we don't have it anymore. I

Unknown Speaker  1:21:19
to make some noise, so we can tell if you're

Speaker 5  1:21:27
there. Here, we are. You there? Can you hear me? Yeah, yeah. All right, I'm here.

Matthias Miller  1:21:33
So my my question, just in terms of the encryption issue, is, do you have? There's any any degree of lens we can take. So the most severe is every time you want to pull up anything, you have to enter some kind of password to even view it, which makes exporting things difficult. There's less severe like you can enter in a password which unlocks it for all people who have permissions, or even for yourself for a certain period of time. And those both involve additional development. The simplest way is having just user level restrictions that only certain people can see the full number. And if there are people who need just the last four for any purposes, adding a secondary permission just to view the last four and then never store them in activity history and never, never include them when we copied over to the test system. And I thought it'd be helpful to hear from you what your concerns specifically were, and if there were any of these that you're happy with.

Speaker 5  1:22:39
Yeah. So the first thing is, I don't really think it's an issue for the last four digits to be visible to anyone and everyone. I don't that's that's not problematic. If we can encrypt them to that place, and that's the overall default, I think we're good there. The next piece would be, I think we're we're uploading a lot of attachments, so those forms have all of that information. And the part that's concerning about that is, not only do they have the complete social security number or EIN number, but they have the mailing address and like, there's some additional identifiers. So I think making it somewhat having a different level for those attachments would be helpful. I'm a little bit concerned about just giving admin permission, simply because at this point, everybody just gets admin because there's, it's like, Oh, give them admin. It's fine. We trust them. It's fine. And so, like, you kind of defeat the purpose a little bit of that. What I'm wondering is, you know, I heard drew say something about the fact that in order to use his tax software, there is something that he's having to do anyway to to move all these numbers over. And so there is a part of me that's wondering if this is the right place to be storing them like this, or if it would be better to say, Yeah, we want to be able to run a report. But then, is there somewhere that we can, is there, is there a secure file that we could keep a few of these types of things? I don't know what I'm asking.

Speaker 3  1:24:22
You're thinking for the documents, not necessarily just, or for the numbers as well?

Speaker 5  1:24:32
Yes, I mean, if the numbers are encrypted on the account, someone's going to at some point, have to be able to see the whole thing in some way. So, I mean, I think once we have it done, once it's only new vendors coming in, so that, that redo in coming years, you will have less than we do this year to, you know, update,

Unknown Speaker  1:24:57
the update, yeah, yeah, yeah. But

Unknown Speaker  1:25:02
so do your question. Matthias, I didn't absolutely love any of the options you gave.

Speaker 5  1:25:11
I think that the only truly secure one is where you have to key in some type of code in order to to view it. So the others are not exactly gonna, probably serve the same purpose,

Matthias Miller  1:25:33
yeah, and I mean, even with that, there's levels of

Speaker 1  1:25:39
Yes, too simplistic, but could we have, if you do anything with you can see the last four digits, but in order to see the the whole, the entire social security number, or to view any of the uploads or to edit anything out, like adding or adding new attachments or new social Security numbers for new vendors, you have to have this password. And we just, I don't just,

Unknown Speaker  1:26:05
there's only three or four people that have that password, and we just change it every month or so. I mean, we well,

Speaker 5  1:26:15
I mean, you wouldn't even have to change it, really. It would just be, like, if that was something that drew had, I mean, because theoretically you can shoot this full of holes Matthias, you shouldn't have to have authorization to upload the information. But once it's in, it saves, it encrypts, and now you can't get it back out or view it, and only somebody at a higher level would be able to do that. I don't know if that's possible. Well,

Matthias Miller  1:26:45
why would we give drew a separate email account if you want to reduce the attack surface, how's this different than giving having only one account in the system? Well, hang on, if Drew has multi factor authentication turned on, which everybody who's logging in should have two factor authentication turned on.

Speaker 5  1:27:09
End of story. Well, then you have to set it so that it's required.

Matthias Miller  1:27:14
That's a Google workspace configuration that we don't have a control on. Don't have a control over. But if, if Drew has two factor then and we just have it permission based that only drew can view, is there really? Does that solve the issue?

Speaker 1  1:27:37
Can we add, I would suggest we also at Duane or Landes, so we have somebody else, but

Speaker 3  1:27:49
gonna be more of a individual user thing, not a user level.

Matthias Miller  1:27:58
Well, you might have, I mean, we could create a security group for, you know, can you personal information, personal documents, whatever the right terminology, or, you know, a PII. That's what I'm looking for, like some kind of PII user group that only has this permission enable and only has, you know, one to three users in it, which you should do anyway. You should be using role based, role based so that you can easily see who's part of what group and whatever that's there's a whole if you, if you guys really get serious about security, there's a whole host of wide open opportunities for people to come do all kinds of stuff that they probably shouldn't. But if we that doesn't, okay. So now, if we want them to specifically enter a password, why don't we could also create a custom Google workspace account that also has two factor authentication, if you really want. Here's an idea. This is a wild idea. Give create a special Google workspace account if you guys really want to build accountability into this custom workspace again, Google business account that that is only used for this, and Drew has a password, and Dwayne or Leanne has the two factor phone number, and so they're always communicating whenever they have to log in respectively to get into the account. You know, there's all kinds of ways. My point being, let me, let me not ramble. My point being, what's the difference between entering a password every time versus just having a secure account log in? We trust them. I

Speaker 5  1:29:49
like what you just the idea that you just came up with. There is a designated email, and there's a couple of people that have access to that user profile, and that's it. I. I think that would serve the same purpose.

Speaker 2  1:30:05
So, but then that user on the system would only be the user that can actually access

Speaker 5  1:30:09
this great other people could upload information, but they couldn't view it after it was encrypted. So I mean, that would take care of the concerns that I had entirely. So

Speaker 2  1:30:19
can, could, could it could be, could we, like, make an RG, where we these were the that's where the attachments go. That's where a the social security numbers go. And so only person like, are this feel like, if there's truly attachments that are that are being uploaded to these, these records that have the same information. Well, then, then we got to put that behind that wall as well.

Matthias Miller  1:30:47
Well, if we're using the s3 this requires a conversation with Josh, but if we're using Josh's s3 upload, then it seems to me like we can just restrict the RG rows for the uploads and and we're fine, but we're not so that then becomes a Josh question. This is on a contact record, right? Let's go into a vendor just to make sure there's not anything special. There is, yeah, so, well, I mean, but no, but we could restrict the notes fields too, which I'm pretty sure restricts. Should restrict document archive so, so we can

Speaker 2  1:31:35
the other way do it. So you would just put social security number in the note field.

Matthias Miller  1:31:40
No, we can have a separate field. That's fine. That's not a problem. Is it okay? If only drew and select only the elite can upload secure documents?

Speaker 2  1:31:53
I would, I would think whoever has access to that that you're saying

Speaker 5  1:31:57
upload or download or both upload. You wanted.

Speaker 2  1:32:02
You wanted to have anybody could upload it and but you can only certain people can download. That's what you wanted. Well,

Speaker 5  1:32:08
that would serve our purpose more. It would allow more people to do the workload while still maintaining the security of it kind of, I mean, we do this a lot of times with other things, like, you know, you do that with Dropbox. And, of course, I know that this is not Dropbox, so I get it that is different software, but you allow people to to upload things to you. Once it's uploaded, it's out of their hands. They can't see it. That that was the where my brain was.

Speaker 2  1:32:38
Well, that could be accomplished by using the the s3 stuff.

Matthias Miller  1:32:46
So how urgent is it to get this fixed?

Speaker 1  1:32:52
Right? We don't need it for this, right? We're just, we're handling everything

Speaker 5  1:32:57
Well, right now it's just very unsecure. You can I can see everybody, can see everybody's social security

Matthias Miller  1:33:02
numbers in there. But that

Speaker 2  1:33:03
could be, that could be restricted immediately. So let's do this short

Matthias Miller  1:33:07
term, short term plan. Do we have a current Do we have a social security field right

Speaker 5  1:33:12
now? Yeah, yes, under vendors, okay, it's the 1099, project.

Matthias Miller  1:33:18
It's, it's tax 99 No, it's the tax. Do you mean tax ID, or is it some additional tax ID field? Okay, yes, so restrict tax ID field, restrict executive notes, restrict notes. Add permission, or can view sense, can view PII,

Unknown Speaker  1:33:46
and that handles the attachments

Matthias Miller  1:33:47
to deny all yes later and then. So then that means that you guys, in the short term, are going to have to upload it, sorry, and then we have to coordinate with Josh to move these attachments to s3 and,

Speaker 5  1:34:03
and that's, I mean, just making it not visible when you land on that is a huge step in the right direction.

Matthias Miller  1:34:15
Seth, let me email this, not that it's much to remember, but and then we should, I am 95% sure. I mean 99% sure that we restrict restrictions for document archive, but please test that we respect restrictions for doc archive.

Matthias Miller  1:34:39
Should maybe actually do that first, before you get too deep in the needs.

Unknown Speaker  1:34:44
Do you need me for anything else, or can I drop off?

Matthias Miller  1:34:46
That's it. Thanks guys. Thank you.

Unknown Speaker  1:35:05
Okay,

Matthias Miller  1:35:08
good. I mean, that's not complicated again a couple hours unless Seth runs into snags, right? Yeah, so

Unknown Speaker  1:35:23
just looking at priority, here we have

Speaker 1  1:35:32
the asset management thing. Number one was, okay, we're making some changes. I think the only two things we have are making some changes for on that asset management report and adding a field for description, and then this encryption on social security numbers. Right is that I think those are the only two, and I think they're both. It doesn't matter which which we have first any on Is there other sensitive information that we should handle at the same time? I think when you had mentioned ACH information on vendors, but I don't know what's your thought. I mean, you can see that on any

Speaker 2  1:36:20
if I did, I'm surprised, because it ACH is not generally considered to be secure information or sensitive information. I mean, you can get the same information off of somebody's check when they send it to you. Yeah, right,

Unknown Speaker  1:36:33
so social security and ein would be the only thing that's I

Matthias Miller  1:36:44
a good there's a whole other sometime when we're sitting around with not too much to do if you really want something to keep you up at night, think about the attack surface that you have, and the primary vulnerability is all the people who have accounts with lousy passwords and don't have two factor authentication and have way too many permissions. The worst thing is not, is not a visible attack. The worst thing is somebody sneaking in over lunch break, you know, regularly for over an extended period of time, and creating weird, obnoxious stuff here and there that goes undetected for six to 12 months. So with those peaceful thoughts that's all really I have to contribute,

Speaker 3  1:37:38
I do have one other item, and that is just making another user for me. I do have the Google thing set up for my druid era services.net, email address.

Matthias Miller  1:37:52
So can we just switch your user over?

Speaker 3  1:37:54
Yes, switch switch my user over, but leave that one standing and just change the name on the email the user services, email address that you have that way, then back at the office, they'll use that one for printing.

Matthias Miller  1:38:13
Is that you guys doing terrible?

Matthias Miller  1:38:22
Yeah, let me, let me show you what I what I think you're saying. So we're going to copy this one, and this one is arrow services with this email. Yeah, oh, and this Your name is going to be arrow change the name, okay, and then this becomes drew at what

Unknown Speaker  1:38:53
arrow services.net, yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:38:57
Okay, Dwayne, you happy?

Unknown Speaker  1:39:01
Nice. Should I be unhappy?

Matthias Miller  1:39:02
I don't know. I mean, I think you're administering some of this stuff. Do you want to try logging out, logging it back in with your druid over services. Just make sure it didn't completely ruin your life.

Unknown Speaker  1:39:13
You're saying me,

Matthias Miller  1:39:14
yeah,

Speaker 3  1:39:18
logging out. I think I am out. I don't know. Am I out? I don't know if I'm out. There's

Matthias Miller  1:39:24
a log out button in the this is but there's log out right here, and click here, log back in

Matthias Miller  1:39:38
down here, the bottom. There's no there. Got it, got it. And then, if you've got multiple accounts that you're logged into in Google, it shouldn't prompt you ask which one you want to jump in with? Yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:39:55
Yeah. Okay. Do.

Matthias Miller  1:40:02
And then the main, main thing would make, does this thing need all these permissions?

Speaker 3  1:40:08
Um, yes, and no, like, um, if I want them to help me with something, then it does. Um, if I mean not for just the normal usage, but

Speaker 2  1:40:25
this is exactly how we always end up with everybody at

Speaker 3  1:40:29
admin. Like it's kind of like, if I want say Nelson over there to to help do 1090 nines, well then we need it, you know,

Matthias Miller  1:40:41
right? That's fine, not

Matthias Miller  1:40:50
showing you in here. Leave that for another. That's weird.

Matthias Miller  1:41:00
Okay, well, there you go. If you just if you accidentally use the other one, you'll have confusing audit trails. Yeah, okay, yep, good.

Speaker 1  1:41:13
Thank you. So these myth I asked Seth, are you thinking these two items by next week or two weeks? What are you thinking on time frame?

Speaker 4  1:41:24
Um, I could, for sure, have one done next week, maybe both. I'm not quite sure what my schedule looks like.

Speaker 1  1:41:35
Is there a difference? I would vote for Asset Management first, just because it's No, never mind. That's just No. Do the the encrypting first.

Speaker 4  1:41:47
I'm a little worried about this one, the encrypting stuff, ballooning it. From all my experience doing various projects of this sort, it always is more expensive than you expect. So. But, I mean, I don't mind starting on it. I'm just just yeah, they're warning,

Speaker 1  1:42:05
do the encrypting first, and then the asset stuff is not that big a deal. So

Speaker 4  1:42:13
do you want to track activity history on socials at all, restricted to the same level? Or do we just say, no, let's just not track activity history.

Speaker 1  1:42:22
So if you, if you track activity history, does that mean you could see social security numbers in activity history?

Unknown Speaker  1:42:29
Yes, but only if you had the permission to view the only if you have permission to view the field.

Unknown Speaker  1:42:38
What's your thought? Dwayne, I don't I mean,

Speaker 2  1:42:39
so if I'm understanding you correctly, if you restrict the field that restricts you from viewing it in modification history as well. So I would, I would say it's, let's keep the modification history intact. Then if it actually gets like, if a normal user can't see, you know, that particular line item in the modification history, then let's keep it intact. It means

Matthias Miller  1:43:01
that we need to nuke contact records from activity history when we're creating a test system. That's true, or you could, well, yeah, you should,

Speaker 4  1:43:15
okay, that's why we turn off activity history. We it's hard, very, very difficult to actually nuke activity records.

Matthias Miller  1:43:24
You can use x 20s.

Speaker 4  1:43:27
No, we cannot, okay, I do not want to do that.

Unknown Speaker  1:43:32
He was pretty confident. We

Matthias Miller  1:43:34
just took, we just took your choice away. You're not going to have activity history on them. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:43:40
So what? So you're saying all activity history, or just that particular

Unknown Speaker  1:43:46
on social, so it will

Speaker 2  1:43:49
never track activity history on on social, got it,

Matthias Miller  1:43:54
and if you guys decide that we need it, we'll create a secondary field that is our own janky activity history. Yeah, yeah, no, no,

Speaker 3  1:44:01
yeah. I don't know that we'd have to have it. I mean, in this particular use case, it just means that somebody doesn't get their 1099, which I don't think anybody cares. So the government's just got a bunch of crossed up stuff that doesn't make sense. So,

Matthias Miller  1:44:22
exactly, Cool, good.

Unknown Speaker  1:44:26
Sounds good. Thanks guys. Thank

Unknown Speaker  1:44:28
you. Thank you. Bye.
