Matthias Miller  01:08
Good morning Are you today?

Unknown Speaker  01:29
Can you you hear me? Okay?

Unknown Speaker  01:36
Hello

Matthias Miller  01:52
Hey, there we go about that. So

Speaker 1  02:00
just a quick update on the size. Maybe we have this check in schedule with Drew Drew is here but we are maybe you have updates that we should talk about. But we are we're currently looking at that the GL Account mappings and what what we believe we need to do is just basically rename, go through and rename the IMS, yellow icons one or the other to make so that all of them match. We've done that we've in the past when we switched over the IMS GL accounts. Work with Dwayne on doing that where we had their specific steps that he had to do like before we send in an upload from our SKU data sheet. So our plan was focus on that first and think with Dwayne's help if he shows us where to where and how to rename the GL accounts, either rename or create new ones and then merge the old ones to that on the IMS site, then

Unknown Speaker  03:25
I feel like we can get those to match. So what I'm unless you have something we're missing something or you have something to cover, we felt like it would be the best the best use of our time to focus on that see how far we get to

Matthias Miller  03:51
Okay, okay, one one question on that.

Unknown Speaker  04:01
Are you there?

Unknown Speaker  04:03
I am. Can you hear me?

Matthias Miller  04:05
Yep. Nick, in my question from that my understanding was from Josh, that it's a pretty involved process three, rename IMS, GL accounts in your side with some of the Libre Office times and things like that.

Speaker 1  04:21
It is but it's, you know, it should be a one thing billing will have moving forward will have that to keep them in sync anyway, which there shouldn't be a lot of changes. And the fact that we've, we've done well, we did the initial when we when we took the old ancient GL accounts and said okay, here's our new GL set of accounts. We want to change all of those over and then we did at least one or two other iterations when where we said okay, instead of just making a using a hypothetical example, but instead of having pay payroll taxes we wanted to say payroll taxes and insurance so what needed to happen then is Aaron communicated with Dwayne and I think Dwayne then created a new GL Account payroll taxes and insurance merge the old payroll taxes do that for Aaron send in his upload of real taxes and insurance then when you send in that upload then assist ins that you recognize that then the upload so that was are somewhat involved but just a lot of just very specific steps that need to happen

Matthias Miller  05:46
okay and you're pretty confident that you can get

Matthias Miller  05:57
for example we have administrative expenses utilities propane which comes under

Unknown Speaker  06:08
let's see currently comes

Matthias Miller  06:16
under logistics well there's actually a few depending on which which currently comes under a few different places. So you would let me let me do this then I guess

Unknown Speaker  06:35
my only.

Matthias Miller  07:12
Okay, so now am I right that you're only doing GL accounts for like if an account has a child account you wouldn't be expecting a GL Account mapping

Speaker 1  07:35
if an account okay.

Matthias Miller  07:42
You have FTA production overhead depreciation and then under that you've got buildings and building improvements product equipment and fixtures property improvements rolling stock but you wouldn't be using the parent depreciation account you'd be using one of those sub accounts

Unknown Speaker  08:00
on the IMS side

Unknown Speaker  08:02
yes

Speaker 1  08:04
correct yeah yeah we can we're aware that we can post anything to a an account with sub accounts with some.

Unknown Speaker  08:37
Looking at

Matthias Miller  09:03
well, okay and then

Unknown Speaker  09:17
let's do this then.

Matthias Miller  09:27
So we want to go back to the original

Unknown Speaker  09:53
Okay, so then if

Matthias Miller  10:44
Let me make a quick change to this report

Unknown Speaker  12:03
Okay

Matthias Miller  12:19
all right now there was a we did push an update last night there was a bug that we introduced in

Matthias Miller  12:59
there was a bug that was introduced that will I can send an email to Drew with this information but that will prevent you that will require you to select a an associated GL account when you're editing a

Matthias Miller  13:28
you're editing a and accounting chart of account or accounting GL Account

Speaker 1  13:41
oh I just like yeah to do that because of the boat. It's been injured. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  13:47
But basically, if you guys actually believe in so we've got I guess two options one is I am currently based on the subtype

Unknown Speaker  14:06
let me show you some type as well.

Matthias Miller  14:19
Based on the subtype in the expense hierarchy, proposing a proposing a GL account name if you would want to make the mapping completely automatic

Speaker 1  14:38
you're saying we'll need to have mapping will need to have mapping regardless of even if the if we have one to one matches all across both sides.

Matthias Miller  14:51
Well, I mean, we can if if you go through here

Unknown Speaker  14:58
let me

Matthias Miller  15:01
Let me let me send this over to you as a PDF and then and then it might make it a little easier. That's gonna be painful. I

Unknown Speaker  15:14
mean, is it easier? I mean, we could if it makes more sense, we could screen share and pulled drew in, I just felt like we probably need to, like it seemed like but I guess if, if that's helpful, I just, I wasn't sure that I felt like we didn't have anything.

Matthias Miller  15:47
I think it would be helpful to do a screen share to bring me in. Okay. Let's,

Unknown Speaker  15:59
let's just use the same meeting that we always that we've used in the past. That's great.

Unknown Speaker  16:26
Drew is going to join just

Unknown Speaker  16:30
shortly here

Matthias Miller  16:43
where

Speaker 1  16:43
where is your? Okay, so how's your mapping going to be from the What are you anticipating from the accounting side or use? You would need to look at more than just subtype and the child account like because, like you're going to have Pilates pro pain, numerous places, so you'd have to go back. Other than that, I guess?

Matthias Miller  17:15
Yeah, it would be the subtype. And then all the parents like the entire

Unknown Speaker  17:24
you're going to use the entire for joining now. So yeah.

Unknown Speaker  17:37
I'm going to drop here and we'll just use the audio on.

Unknown Speaker  18:00
All right.

Matthias Miller  18:03
So Drew, we were making some changes last night to kind of keep live.

Speaker 2  18:09
And just so you know, we created Come on. So it was a little bit different.

Matthias Miller  18:22
Well, so I think I'm switching it

Unknown Speaker  18:24
back. But let's, let's try this.

Matthias Miller  18:29
So if you go into an account, and you try to edit an account, and save, if the associated GL account is blank, okay, it's going to give you an error. So, we will fix that. But in the short term,

Unknown Speaker  18:46
you're gonna have to find

Matthias Miller  18:50
well, either you just can't modify these accounts today. Or you're gonna have to find something in inactive. GL account to select so that you can save it. And we'll clean it up later.

Speaker 3  19:01
Okay. And the associated GL accounts are the accounts in the

Speaker 2  19:06
IMS system, right? That's correct. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  19:11
So now talk you through about the process for mapping. We can if we want to derive the account name entirely based off the subtype. And all the parent accounts, which you can see here accounts for about 80% probably 80% of these

Speaker 2  19:31
these things. And if we want to do that, there are all of these accounts.

Matthias Miller  19:42
Like, here's one self storage, income and expenses. I think most of these map would map across if you renamed him to.

Speaker 2  19:52
Was that self self storage? Yeah, like that.

Matthias Miller  20:03
Rent and real estate was one that I noticed that probably needs to be split into two different IMS accounts, etc. So if you guys, so a good place to start would be to go through here. If you guys are comfortable with the proposed GL Account column here and then using these as the IMS account

Unknown Speaker  20:27
names okay,

Matthias Miller  20:31
then we can, then that's really all that's required on my end. And then we can and then you can start making the renames in the IMS

Unknown Speaker  20:43
accounts to match. Okay, now,

Matthias Miller  20:49
if you find that you don't like these, and you want to have them different, that's not a problem. We just need to

Unknown Speaker  21:00
what we'll end up doing then is

Matthias Miller  21:04
probably what I'll end up having you do then is is? Well you'll just have to figure out you can export this as an Excel and figure out what it is that you want these names to be renamed the IMS stuff, and then we can once we make this fix this bug fix and I can I can get it imported back in in and get the accounts associated

Speaker 3  21:28
directly. If we were just well already has a file upload changes for that IMS GL account. So we just make what changes on there. We want yes on that. And just like normal.

Unknown Speaker  21:46
Okay, God, you're saying?

Speaker 3  21:49
Yeah, no question I have. So if it says missing over here on the status, does that mean that it is missing a mapping? Or it's

Unknown Speaker  22:01
it's missing an account?

Unknown Speaker  22:03
On the accounting side? Or what's missing? Sure.

Matthias Miller  22:08
So it means that it thinks based on the subtype label, that there should be a self data storage rental revenue, self storage IMS account,

Unknown Speaker  22:17
but there is none.

Matthias Miller  22:23
If you go up here, let's see if we can find one of these. Here is one where if we do the automatic, you know, the auto naming. subtype is current assets. It's under FTI production overhead rent slash equipment. That one actually exists, but it's inactive.

Speaker 4  22:44
What is inactive mean? Does that mean? It's just it hasn't been? What it hasn't been used? Or what does that mean?

Matthias Miller  22:54
It means that it's no longer intended to be used, but it was used in the past

Unknown Speaker  23:05
so these accounts here, we would still have to go in

Speaker 3  23:12
to each of the accounts and select that one that is proposed. It's not necessarily saying that that those are math just because they're on that list.

Unknown Speaker  23:23
Well I guess if if you guys

Unknown Speaker  23:38
Yeah, we will

Matthias Miller  23:39
probably end up we can do that automatically for you. If if you like these names, if these names work for you. If you actually want to manually assign names, I'm not sure that we can actually manually update the names in the live system as it stands today. So you can update the IMS, you can update the IMS names but you can't update things on the chart of accounts or you could likely run into issues on the chart of accounts side of things on the accounting side of things so

Unknown Speaker  24:14
yeah for today All right, explain myself

Matthias Miller  24:24
if you like these, these automatic determinations of names and that's what you exactly what you use the whole way through then then I can just use an automatic process to populate those fields. And then store that in in the accounting system. If you want if you don't like these names that are generated and for some reason you want something different which I don't think I mean it sounds like you don't like you're either gonna change the accounting the accounting system or you're gonna change IMS.

Unknown Speaker  24:58
So This,

Speaker 3  25:02
you're talking about liking these names. So that's not necessarily the name of an account in the IMS system.

Matthias Miller  25:11
No, but this is the this is the Okay, these are because these are active and these exist. In this case this one is not. Because these are this is what it would expect the name to be based on our auto generating them. However, it's actually called church projects income and expenses under IMS.

Unknown Speaker  25:38
The situation

Unknown Speaker  25:47
that makes sense.

Matthias Miller  25:48
Oh, totally explain this poorly. But

Speaker 4  25:57
But am I understanding correctly that the only reason we can't make changes to the accounting side is because of the book today. Correct. So if that were fixed, then we could because I think we're gonna go through and we're going to have changes on either side that we're going to want to make to make

Unknown Speaker  26:18
so that they're

Speaker 4  26:20
the same. So if it weren't for the bulk, then we could we would say, Oh, this one, we want to use all caps and put a dash in this one, then we would just do that on the accounting side. And everything would be fine for that one. And then we have another one where we want to change on the IMS side where we would have to follow change the IMS process to do that?

Unknown Speaker  26:45
Well, and I guess technically, to get a little bit more nuanced. Technically, you could make that

Matthias Miller  26:57
change as long as the associated GL account is non blank. So as long as you don't accidentally, I had one case where I accidentally let me add this to here. So you can see.

Matthias Miller  27:19
This is like maybe we want to I don't know if that's even helpful. Properly? Let me take that back. I don't think it's helpful. So what would you need to do? So let's say for the sake of example, gets this boring flow storage. Or let's say, let's pick the Union Grove. Here, you can rename the subtype. The you could rename the subtype, no problem, if you wanted to use a different subtype for this. Or if you wanted to rename the account name for some reason, the main thing you'd have to do is just go find a I mean, in this case, you could just map it out to this account, even if it's doesn't, you just have to fill in this field to not to some kind of some kind of account, just so that you're able to save, save your changes.

Unknown Speaker  28:28
But does that have to

Speaker 4  28:29
be the when you say associated? Can that just be any GL account? Or can it be doesn't have to be the one you're managing?

Matthias Miller  28:35
It's fine if we just make it be anyone as long as we're using a deterministic method, this proposed GL account and we're going to rename them both to match that we can for today, we can ignore this and come back and clean these up tomorrow.

Speaker 3  28:53
If we did select the one that we would want for that, it would just keep us from needing to come back and

Unknown Speaker  29:00
yeah. Does that make sense? I think so,

Speaker 4  29:10
clarifying question question. The proposed GL account that you have listed here that that proposed GL account is what we're seeing there is coming from the accounting side. It is

Matthias Miller  29:24
yes it is looking at the accounting side it's looking at the subtype and all parent account names using slashes to separate and coming up with a name from the accounting side. And then here showing whether that exists in IMS.

Speaker 3  29:42
Okay. Okay. Makes sense. So if we, if we go to those names, what's the balance sheet gonna look like? You know, is it gonna have this big long thing for each account? Or is it just gonna list just the account name like I have

Speaker 2  30:02
on the, in the accounting side accounts there, the balance sheet will show

Matthias Miller  30:10
almost exactly what it currently shows.

Unknown Speaker  30:13
Okay, there's,

Matthias Miller  30:14
there's a change request that we have to add at the subtype of sections, you got administrative expenses and self storage, etc. But, yeah, no. Okay, just, yeah.

Speaker 3  30:26
I just didn't want these big long names on each line where it has all the parents and subtypes and everything in there, you know, like, like that proposed.

Unknown Speaker  30:35
Thing is,

Speaker 4  30:38
this report is it's simply for mapping the two, right? Correct. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 2  30:45
Okay. I think that's making sense. So anything that says, missing needs attention to? Yes.

Matthias Miller  30:56
Anything with missing needs attention, anything with inactive probably needs attention to? And any of these, these are active IMS GL accounts. And any of these, you know, you should you should have exactly the same number of these as are missing down here, but probably you won't. So you got to figure out what, what to do with the extras that

Unknown Speaker  31:22
show up here. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  31:25
Is this mapping report life and we're

Unknown Speaker  31:28
all like these, these extras if

Speaker 4  31:31
we read like some of those extras on the IMS site, I'm sure if we rename them

Unknown Speaker  31:38
to match what you put in and

Speaker 4  31:41
if we do that, well that is this report live to where those the missing will go away and I'm so

Unknown Speaker  31:47
active. Correct.

Matthias Miller  31:49
Okay. listed the top left eight and then

Unknown Speaker  31:52
all these workers as well. Yep. Got it.

Matthias Miller  31:58
Okay, sorry for the confusion

Speaker 4  32:07
I don't think it'll be that bad because we I mean, we started with the IMS was the original chart of accounts and then

Speaker 2  32:16
drew added you added some that

Unknown Speaker  32:21
fear additions and a few names and cheeses

Unknown Speaker  32:23
and so I think once we have the two matching then as long as we always update both sides, the accounting and the IMS side at the same time that

Speaker 2  32:39
should be good. So we'll just have to get with Dwayne on

Speaker 4  32:46
what process he used on the IMS site to like either merge or direct rename them or what what he did in the past before we run it off before we send an upload in

Unknown Speaker  32:59
so it doesn't yeah all right.

Speaker 4  33:07
Good question i the development for when you select the GL account do you expect that out to bend like how when you

Unknown Speaker  33:18
select so that you don't have to select

Unknown Speaker  33:23
is that hasn't that hasn't been done yet as a door

Unknown Speaker  33:27
it's more what did you call it like?

Speaker 2  33:51
Remember, you're listening need to know the numbers like until they get that done.

Unknown Speaker  33:59
What do you call that?

Speaker 3  34:00
That's why it's like a drop down Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  34:09
I have a reason.

Unknown Speaker  34:11
Because it was when you enter into banking if you go through

Unknown Speaker  34:16
100 Like is there wasn't

Speaker 3  34:22
there wasn't done yet. And you take the current chart of accounts and you got to enter something, a drop down menu and we'll give you give you start typing repairs to the bracket with three different repairs or different sentiments. That

Unknown Speaker  34:35
is the number

Unknown Speaker  34:37
because it doesn't show it doesn't show.

Speaker 2  34:40
Oh, it looks like it should be live. Okay.

Matthias Miller  34:46
Like if we go into create a new account

Unknown Speaker  34:49
here, and you do retain?

Matthias Miller  34:55
Well, it's I mean, it's only showing based on our discussion we're only showing one level

Unknown Speaker  35:02
Your shows the

Speaker 3  35:06
huh? So I thought we had said that it should show the type as well like whether it's an asset or liability.

Unknown Speaker  35:16
It was gonna be like just the parent level,

Speaker 3  35:17
and then asset or liability or?

Unknown Speaker  35:21
And I think the initial one proposal was that,

Speaker 4  35:28
like the parent or the asset or liability is going to show on the right or separately in the column on the right.

Unknown Speaker  35:40
Like it would show over here,

Matthias Miller  35:45
or that it would show in this drop list

Speaker 3  35:48
in the drop list, it was just going to be clear over on the right. Well, okay, it was going to be where he put the

Unknown Speaker  35:57
where he put the parent account.

Matthias Miller  36:02
So would you want it something like this

Unknown Speaker  36:05
inside? A dash,

Speaker 3  36:09
dash would be great inside like that with a dash? I would say that we're What do you think?

Speaker 4  36:16
Yeah, but I thought we were also going to, like concatenate more than just the parent account, like several levels.

Unknown Speaker  36:24
Now, that's what I decided not to do.

Speaker 4  36:27
But will that give you like, so we have utilities propane or utility stayed in a lot of different places like

Speaker 2  36:33
that still wouldn't? Well, we still need to have nails are, are marketing. Yeah, purchasing?

Unknown Speaker  36:41
Yeah. And I think those

Speaker 2  36:46
I guess, there there would be a difference.

Speaker 3  36:51
Most of it, a lot of it's going to be, you know, it's an inventory thing, it's

Unknown Speaker  36:56
an asset, or otherwise, it's an expense.

Speaker 3  37:03
But I guess there would be those few times where it's, some of those utilities

Unknown Speaker  37:09
are not going well.

Matthias Miller  37:11
Okay. But when you're entering them, most of these things are gonna get entered as vendor invoices. Yeah. Which means that you're gonna have

Unknown Speaker  37:23
you're gonna have the full list

Matthias Miller  37:31
very few of these are actually going to be entered through the accounting system itself.

Speaker 3  37:36
Well, that's one of the things that I was thinking about, you know, how much how much differences at all make if you only have one person

Speaker 2  37:43
or only a few people that know the number system really well. They won't need just a lot of helps, but

Unknown Speaker  38:12
did you

Unknown Speaker  38:14
I mean, there would be those couple of months and

Unknown Speaker  38:18
they're all on only

Speaker 3  38:19
show utilities above it. And it could be administrative or it could be

Unknown Speaker  38:23
marketing could be sales.

Unknown Speaker  38:26
While we have other instances like that,

Speaker 2  38:28
I was looking for the proposal that Ben had thought that was yeah, we're looking at one level with the with the type attached to it.

Unknown Speaker  38:43
Okay, so wait, okay, what exactly okay, I

Unknown Speaker  38:46
don't have the type

Unknown Speaker  38:47
on it. But I think

Speaker 2  38:55
that seems like it could still

Speaker 2  39:04
always be very essential information. I think the main thing that that we had is like whatever you call them, some type of sales. Yes. Production overhead.

Speaker 3  39:23
So if we had if we had the subtype

Unknown Speaker  39:27
instead of I think that would be more helpful

Speaker 3  39:31
because propane. We know that utility we don't have to know we just have we need to know so that sales

Unknown Speaker  39:44
we would

Unknown Speaker  39:47
Yeah, but the subtype instead of the type.

Unknown Speaker  39:52
At the end there is something here It's thought Stephen Ste Bailey

Unknown Speaker  40:13
yes

Unknown Speaker  40:22
oh it would be

Unknown Speaker  40:33
so let's do this yeah that is

Unknown Speaker  40:54
then if we actually do this

Matthias Miller  41:17
so it's filtered down to pain

Speaker 2  41:25
but here you still have you know under cogs well it does get sold 60 versus 64 When they're both

Unknown Speaker  41:37
still the same

Unknown Speaker  41:47
yeah

Unknown Speaker  41:50
so what are those? Like if we look at the

Unknown Speaker  41:54
the entire

Speaker 4  41:59
chart of accounts or the the entire list or that is it

Matthias Miller  42:07
steel this over here

Speaker 3  42:10
sales that shouldn't be Cost of Goods anyway this was supposed to be 50s

Unknown Speaker  42:20
Something went wrong with this because of okay we

Unknown Speaker  42:27
should be Yes

Speaker 4  42:33
Okay, so here's so we have Cost of Goods Sold logistics are

Matthias Miller  42:42
six

Unknown Speaker  42:43
cents I'm confused.

Unknown Speaker  42:46
Something went wrong.

Unknown Speaker  42:48
Something's wrong. They're supposed to be cost

Matthias Miller  42:52
6036 138 Let's get back to

Unknown Speaker  42:57
that point Meanwhile,

Matthias Miller  42:59
I'm losing myself

Unknown Speaker  43:02
yeah there's a

Matthias Miller  43:07
chain there it is an FTDI

Unknown Speaker  43:11
Yeah, that's supposed to be there.

Matthias Miller  43:14
We have two utilities under logistics yeah

Speaker 3  43:25
well, there's supposed to be a switch to administrative expenses or something like that right there. Sales expenses.

Unknown Speaker  43:34
Got it. Ya know?

Unknown Speaker  43:39
So the numbers are great.

Matthias Miller  43:43
subtype subtype

Unknown Speaker  43:47
Yeah, got it. Well, now

Unknown Speaker  43:51
I need to go back and look at my look at my upload sheet. I'm hoping

Speaker 4  44:00
not the employer running the import multiple window

Speaker 3  44:04
well that's what I wonder got it running the import multiple times just cross threaded.

Unknown Speaker  44:11
Well, if you Let's go find out what

Unknown Speaker  44:20
is important.

Matthias Miller  44:24
Let's see. Is it the same one that you would have sent me?

Unknown Speaker  44:26
Yeah, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  44:32
Interesting that we landed on one that right?

Speaker 2  44:38
Probably Probably all those other ones are. Let's see that. 138 So that's the parents here.

Unknown Speaker  44:52
Well, it's I'm getting to

Unknown Speaker  44:58
Okay, well We'll take a look and find out whether what's going on with subtype.

Speaker 4  45:08
Okay, works from where it switches from 50. Like on the number, the set of numbers far left from 50 to 60 is where it should switch from,

Speaker 2  45:18
which we're building that up from

Speaker 4  45:23
calls to sales. And then what is Yeah. Oops, sorry. And then 60 to, or that switches, again, I think it goes from sales to marketing, marketing, and then 64 to

Speaker 3  45:43
60 sales and 62 is marketing. 64. Is administration. Okay. Yeah. So there that that subtype would show that difference?

Unknown Speaker  45:55
If it were correct?

Speaker 2  46:03
I will. Well, I'll add it to my list of digging today. Bottom line, not sure what went on? So it's probably not until we

Speaker 4  46:19
figure that out, it's probably not a good use of time to work on matching, you're

Speaker 3  46:25
gonna have the bug or have to put a mapping account in and well, I mean,

Unknown Speaker  46:38
or is there a downside to

Matthias Miller  46:41
let me see if I can work around work, just come up with a workaround for, for putting the mapping in and you can, you can basically ignore that field. And if I can do that,

Unknown Speaker  46:52
then

Matthias Miller  46:56
then you can keep it and if I can, if I can resolve the issue with

Unknown Speaker  47:00
the subtypes, then

Matthias Miller  47:03
then you can, but

Speaker 2  47:07
I'm going to need to have a little bit of time to get that squared away. So you'll look

Speaker 4  47:14
into this and then update us what you find. And then in the meantime, you could work on

Unknown Speaker  47:19
the finished goods inventory.

Unknown Speaker  47:27
We could still look at some of these changes and just figure out what

Unknown Speaker  47:31
to do if we don't change them here.

Matthias Miller  47:35
Well, let me start by chasing this down

Unknown Speaker  47:38
and good. Okay.

Matthias Miller  47:44
And Drew, do you want to phone call or email when I've find out more? Oh, just an email sign. Okay, good.

Unknown Speaker  47:55
I will do that. Thanks.
