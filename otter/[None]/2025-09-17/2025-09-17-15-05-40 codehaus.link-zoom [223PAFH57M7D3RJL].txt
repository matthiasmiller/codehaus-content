Unknown Speaker  00:26
Fine, okay, oh. Okie dokie, well,

Matthias Miller  00:34
contract balance is showing off for a few cents on EPO contracts for whatever it's worth, and I don't really know that we want to fix it, but

Unknown Speaker  00:52
Okay, show me. Um, oh,

Unknown Speaker  00:54
I'm sorry. I thought I was sharing my screen. Um, let me my

Matthias Miller  01:02
wife is horrified that she married a guy who keeps a bajillion tabs open. Okay,

Matthias Miller  01:16
so I added a contract resolutions. Oh, it was supposed to be multi selected. It's not a contract resolution filter to this, I could easily find EPO. Yeah, it makes sense.

Matthias Miller  01:35
Anyway, basically, basically, we have a contract value minus rep pay, but the savings from EPO,

Speaker 1  01:43
there's a what, what? Oh, this is the ellipsis thingy.

Matthias Miller  01:47
These are the ellipses. They're gonna fix. Nick is gonna fix the the weird, this weird thing right here,

Speaker 1  01:53
yeah, yeah, yeah. But yeah, that's the interesting. And you're gonna want to see this.

Matthias Miller  01:58
Hold on. Let me pull up a CR, let me pull up a CRA. Check this out, because that's even that's even cooler.

Unknown Speaker  02:12
Hey, look now he's got the

Matthias Miller  02:13
ellipses in. Okay, so we got the contract value, and that's just, you know, lovely monthly times. Yep. Wait, why is that 288 See, here's why we do this contract value, right? Because it's the it's the 288 it's not including dwf. 288 96 times, 48 months. Contract balance is the contract value minus rent paid. We should exclude EPO that was done, yeah, if it yeah,

Speaker 2  02:49
what's the logic for not including all of the whatever is on that contract in that little first drop? That's first little ellipsis that you showed me on this one and that one there, yeah,

Matthias Miller  03:01
because you can just drive drop into here and,

Unknown Speaker  03:05
okay, you see it there. It's fine. See,

Matthias Miller  03:07
that's the main reason. I mean, if we would change this to a I was just curious, yeah, if we change it to a memo, we could easily throw it in more places. But anyway, um, savings from EPO should go away

Speaker 1  03:20
if it's not an EPO, it's not an EPO, right? That makes sense.

Matthias Miller  03:25
Plus CRA tax of 119, 46 All right, so then hang on here. Okay, that was contract balance, early payoff amount, contract total minus Amount Paid equals the rental balance. Amount Paid would actually be why? Again, we can change this. This is just copying, largely on a spreadsheet. We don't have any unpaid rental fees. So the balance for EPO is this plus this times 50% on a 48 month equals this EPO amount, add back in the CRA, no outstanding rental fees, equals this subtotal minus the CRA amount gives you the payoff. Amount of 3513

Speaker 2  04:26
64, oh, the only. And the only thing that I would say, from an improvement standpoint, was make that last line bold.

Unknown Speaker  04:33
This one here. That'd

Speaker 2  04:37
be a great because all of the is like, this is how we got there. But that's the number that we want our eyes to be drawn to. That's the quick and dirty number of so

Speaker 1  04:46
this is phenomenal. Like, literally, you're in any contract, you can just click that and, like, that's that. This is very similar to what RTO pro puts in at the end when you're paying

Speaker 2  04:54
off. The question that I have here on this window at all, is this. Has a CRA, yes, and where are we reflecting the tax for that CRA,

Matthias Miller  05:07
we all includes tax at this point.

Speaker 2  05:09
Okay, so the CRA would be less than that, or,

Matthias Miller  05:17
yeah, the CRA, the non taxable CRA, is 1706, 53,

Speaker 1  05:21
so, so you're representing the CRA there with tax correct.

Matthias Miller  05:25
But I don't know if I'm slightly trying to make some tax mistakes here.

Speaker 2  05:29
Do that okay, because that's back,

Unknown Speaker  05:32
no, because you're adding it back in.

Speaker 2  05:35
But they don't have tax, so you would actually be the math would have to go,

Speaker 1  05:38
Oh, yeah. So the, well, actually, no, this would be right if the minus CRA right before payoff would be the original, the 1700 Correct? You track Matthias,

Matthias Miller  05:54
the minus needs to be without tax. That's right. Okay, we're not

Speaker 2  06:00
gonna ask. We're going to require them to pay an additional, right, whatever that dollar value you showed on the other screen was, so the payoff is going to, actually, yeah, okay.

Speaker 1  06:12
This is insanely, this is insanely cool.

Speaker 2  06:15
I mean, that's, you know, small technical, because this gets very technical.

Speaker 3  06:21
Yes, I

Matthias Miller  06:26
was giving one of the team members

Speaker 1  06:28
to have a contract screen up on, on a contract detail screen up on, on the big screen, and be able to click that and go, here's the information. It's just click. There it is. Click, there it is. I and then you go out in the contract report, and you hit the tool tip thing, it does, like,

Speaker 2  06:48
it's just too bad Matthias that you can't be there. What is the when is the demo time?

Speaker 1  06:52
I know he's gonna He's gonna come in later. He's gonna come in after the demo.

Speaker 2  06:56
That's just, that's unfortunate. That way I could, that way I can

Speaker 1  06:59
say things and promise all kinds of things that he just can't screw up his face at.

Matthias Miller  07:04
Yeah, thanks, man, this

Speaker 2  07:06
is really dangerous. Don't ask me how I know

Unknown Speaker  07:10
you're letting me off the leash here.

Matthias Miller  07:15
Okay, let me see if I can

Unknown Speaker  07:19
do I you. I'm

Matthias Miller  07:23
gonna see if I can.

Unknown Speaker  07:25
I got this thing here.

Speaker 2  07:27
Can't believe that cards for me and put my cell phone number, but it's okay. Figure it out. So you

Speaker 1  07:39
didn't like that. You're gonna get that phone to zillion anyway, and you're gonna get a whole new phone.

Matthias Miller  07:49
Okay? Font Size is wrong here. Where's my share?

Matthias Miller  07:59
We gotta fix the font size. Well, maybe you don't want the font size fixed. Wait, what, where did my What did I just do? Oh, are we making

Unknown Speaker  08:11
it slightly larger? How's it? Were you making it slightly larger?

Matthias Miller  08:19
Not in, not intentionally. Here this guy, that's why I wasn't showing up. Minus CRA of so we have, yeah, 5339, 63, minus 1706, 53 equals 3633 10 and contractor, we pay off tool tip you should. I don't know what it should be, but probably more like

Unknown Speaker  09:05
Yeah, like that,

Unknown Speaker  09:08
yeah, yeah.

Matthias Miller  09:12
So there you go. And then once you when you're over here at this report, you can just go, okay, early, pay off. Boom. This one can't be bold, but

Speaker 1  09:20
that's fine, okay, look at that. That isn't

Matthias Miller  09:25
meeting months.

Unknown Speaker  09:30
Sweet, sweet.

Speaker 2  09:38
Just look at all that data. Data, which is it Matthias? Is it data or data?

Matthias Miller  09:43
It's both. It's like it's potato and potato and

Speaker 1  09:49
all of those. So you're confident on the macros now,

Unknown Speaker  09:53
well,

Matthias Miller  09:55
Ian has it has some spare time to have some time to spare, having, having. Drill down into especially CRA but I mean, drill down into some of this stuff probably wouldn't hurt.

Speaker 2  10:10
It's also entirely fine to be doing a demo and somebody points out a mistake and be like, Thank you for finding that we are still in the build process. That is legitimate.

Matthias Miller  10:21
Yeah, it is legitimate.

Matthias Miller  10:30
There is one issue here, rental balance, rental savings, you should maybe do if

Matthias Miller  10:48
Patrick Event sub,

Matthias Miller  10:56
just do this, this would yield better numbers.

Unknown Speaker  11:20
A expected parameter, other thing we're going to fix here too, as well, which was,

Unknown Speaker  11:27
Do you need me to stay? Or can I? No,

Speaker 1  11:30
you can go. I wanted you to see the little ellipsis thing, because that's just, I love the transparency. The transparency of this is going to be we're going to solve, we're going to have information everywhere. It's probably going to be a little bit going to be a little bit over the

Speaker 2  11:44
top, but I do think that there's there's something we may need to think about. And I think that we can do this too if we want to, but I do think that we almost have too much information on that page, like we don't for the accountant. We don't for like, from a reporting standpoint, but I wonder if we might want to think about a less info page for for the contract screen, like customer service. I don't mean for this right here. No, that report that you had up a minute ago,

Speaker 1  12:25
this guy, yeah, yeah. I mean, I mean, there's

Speaker 2  12:29
probably all different types of configurations that you could do and assign to an individual, but I'm just thinking from like different users standpoints, depending who's in it and what they're doing, we might be able to have a report that would actually work better with less information. Well, it

Speaker 1  12:47
would be, it would be really easy to put a checkbox on this thing and that says expand, and it would expand,

Speaker 2  12:52
right? Yeah. But I mean, just just a little like, it's amazing. I am not I think it's wonderful, and it answers so many questions. And showing somebody what it can do is really powerful. But if you didn't want to be able to see it all, if there, if there was some ability to, you know, unselect it, that that could be potentially valuable.

Matthias Miller  13:11
So what we can, we have this feature. I mean, the platform has a feature called report configurations, where you can, you can give some control over different configurations. Some you know, shared across different people. You can have your own where you can show or hide columns. I think columns way serious.

Speaker 1  13:32
Okay, you you keep yanking out fun little things that we

Matthias Miller  13:35
don't use this in assist because we don't need it. It's not retail. So there's you just throw it user reports, but and you do, recorder

Speaker 2  13:43
doesn't need it to do to help them out. It's possible, yeah, and they don't see it anyway. Well, wait, they do now. But anyway,

Matthias Miller  13:51
you do need to configure it a bit on the back end to add support for it, because not all you know

Unknown Speaker  13:59
customer name or whatever I don't know,

Unknown Speaker  14:01
right? No, that makes sense.

Speaker 1  14:04
That's pretty awesome. So is this you, is if you, if you change this up and you said, like, you can, it's, it's configurable to yourself, like, the next person opens up. It could be configurable for them, for that person, right?

Matthias Miller  14:22
So I could do a save as this configuration, not available users,

Unknown Speaker  14:32
and that, that, how much is that going to cost? Me to add that is, that is

Matthias Miller  14:38
wicked. It's not it's not insane. And then I could even say, Look, you guys are wonky, like, the subject should only be, like, 40 wide for me.

Speaker 1  14:49
And you can, you can rearrange the whole entire columns too.

Matthias Miller  14:53
Oh yeah, you could drag. You could say this one needs to be down here.

Unknown Speaker  14:58
Okay, that is something we do. Definitely need.

Unknown Speaker  15:02
Do you know how awesome this is?

Speaker 1  15:06
Well, I mean, but that means we can go build very, very complex reports and and let, let users kind of build some of their own taste. Yeah. 100% Yeah. No kidding, I love this.

Matthias Miller  15:25
I'm not, I'm running out of rabbits to pull out of my hat. But

Speaker 1  15:29
I mean, well, I mean, okay, so this, this right here was the only, the only, the only small pick that I had with with, like, okay, one of the things I did, like the with, with some of the ways, some of the reporting is, like, in some of these softwares, like the shed app and so forth. Like, you can add columns and you can subtract columns, and you can, you know, shuffle things around without, you know, like, yes, you can do that in reporting as well. But like, you have to know some semblance of the subsets and so forth, or the columns or the, you know, what fields drop in. If we go build some, you know, much, much larger, if we do some of these, like contracts report, we could put a whole bunch of information in there, and then they can add or subtract as needed.

Unknown Speaker  16:19
Yep, yep,

Unknown Speaker  16:32
so,

Matthias Miller  16:41
we got this. We got this. We got so

Matthias Miller  16:55
it's what about both? I,

Matthias Miller  17:13
I feel way better about this

Speaker 1  17:15
stuff than I did this morning. So the the changes that we made to the contract report, can that you had, you had already pushed some of that to standard. Did Did you push that a lot of that stuff to standard?

Matthias Miller  17:26
It is all standard. Currently. I

Speaker 3  17:48
Okay, well,

Unknown Speaker  17:56
all right, we good,

Matthias Miller  17:57
yeah, do we want to? Do you want to anything tomorrow?

Speaker 1  18:05
Yeah, we've, we keep, we keep saying we're going back to the to the past due dashboard, and then, and every single time we've, we've ran into macro issues. So let's, let's, let's plan to see if we can knock that out tomorrow. Good. Sounds good talk then

Unknown Speaker  18:21
have a good evening. You too. Bye.
