Unknown Speaker  02:37
Howdy. Howdy. Howdy. Howdy, Okey dokey, Okey dokey.

Speaker 1  02:45
Smokey, what did you? What did you and the guys get sorted out? Then yesterday,

Matthias Miller  02:53
I don't even remember what we got sorted. I just think we got it sorted, and it's I realized we didn't push an update because we turned off Automatic Updates.

Matthias Miller  03:12
Let me, let me go on a recap.

Matthias Miller  03:31
So came with rental balance. I

Speaker 1  03:49
um, you feel like you have all the all the calculation, macros, squared away, rental balance, contract, value, EPOS,

Matthias Miller  03:58
I think so. But I want to you

Unknown Speaker  04:01
want to push an update to make sure

Matthias Miller  04:05
it's downloading, installing. At the moment, I do want to sanity check. Okay, the past due is the stacked bar past due.

Speaker 2  04:12
Right. Hold on one second. I gotta rearrange my displays here because my my doc decided to it didn't want to work this morning.

Speaker 1  04:24
I think that sucks. Well, I don't every once in a while, it just decides that it's not going to connect, and when it does, it always does it at the most inopportune time. It never picks a nice time to do it.

Speaker 2  04:44
Okay, okay, okay, okay. All right, let's do, where are you? Where are you, there you are okay. Go ahead. Yeah, your question.

Matthias Miller  04:54
All right, so we're doing a Past Due stack, stack bar, right?

Speaker 1  04:58
Yeah. Yeah, that's the one you had started doing on a monthly basis.

Unknown Speaker  05:04
Yeah, and we nailed down. Go ahead.

Matthias Miller  05:12
This is up now. Here's a search contracts report we have effective product value, contract value, the product effective value, contract value, term length, CRA we add a security deposit, rental balance, including tax. Remaining months EPO and payment up.

Speaker 1  05:46
Oh, do you know what we haven't done in here? Why did I miss this?

Unknown Speaker  05:51
The amount paid,

Speaker 1  05:54
which I mean, granted, it's the difference between rental balance and contract value, but, now you know what? Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. Um, so, so, just for kicks and giggles, let's, let's, let me, I'm going to manual run some math here. So effective, effective values, 13, 814, divided by 21.6, should be 639, 54, 54, times. What's the probably 1.07 we're going to say that 684, 31 you're spot on the money. Okay? Payment value is correct, or a monthly value, 648, point 31 times 36 equals 23 339, one.

Unknown Speaker  06:41
Nine. Okay, wait a minute.

Speaker 1  06:45
Design, good tax does not, can we? Can we? Can it? Yeah, let's, let's make it include, because everything you're you're doing other stuff with tax. Pay off with with tax balances in tax, let's go ahead and make the the contract value in tax as well.

Speaker 1  07:38
Okay, so that doesn't quite make sense then, because if you take 684 31 which includes tax times 36 we're not getting the 24,000 why not? It's not

Matthias Miller  07:49
included the payment amount includes dwf, the contract value doesn't Yeah, but

Speaker 1  07:54
your contract value is coming up. If you take 684 31 times 36 684 point 31 times 36 oh, never mind. I must have did bad math. 24 635, you're a spot on the money. I don't know what I

Matthias Miller  08:09
did wrong. Well, there's an eight cent difference, but, yeah, I know that. But rounding Well, it's because of tax being applied

Unknown Speaker  08:20
at one place or the other. I get that. I get that

Matthias Miller  08:24
you don't care.

Unknown Speaker  08:26
Should,

Speaker 1  08:30
well, for the sake of simple math, or the way that people are going to do math, they're going to want to take 684, 31 times 36 so yes, we probably should account for the rounding. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  08:47
I mean, I can just copy this amount, if this amount is right. No, what is that not?

Unknown Speaker  08:56
No, the the Okay, where's my calculator?

Matthias Miller  09:01
Again? There we go.

Speaker 1  09:38
For the sake of, for the sake of, we'll have to come back and fix the macros at some point, is what you're thinking.

Matthias Miller  09:45
Well, I guess so the issue. I mean, if we or the issue, I'm not sure if these numbers actually match the contract. Like this is pre tax,

Speaker 1  09:58
but what you had prior. To that was,

Matthias Miller  10:05
maybe we should do the same multipliers on here, same math on the contract itself in the detail screen.

Speaker 1  10:18
The question really is, do we do we all want to worry about it for the demo. Do you think somebody's going to grab a calculator and go 6431 times 36 oh, it's not quite correct. If we went back to actually using the actual macro math,

Unknown Speaker  10:35
or I don't know, what's your thought?

Matthias Miller  10:48
I can go both ways, because one hand, What? What? Okay, the wait a minute.

Speaker 1  10:54
We're out here on this report. We're you did 684, 31 times the term. Correct the payment, payment amount times start. And if someone opens up the contract and says, Well, why doesn't the effective value over here match? We can say, well, we're not including tax there, and they would have to mentally go and do or manually go and do the math to figure out there's a

Matthias Miller  11:13
rounding error well, and as long as, I think, as long as both sides are internally consistent, so let's just make sure the rental balance. So then the rental balance divided by 684, 31 gives us 23

Matthias Miller  11:35
the rental balance. 15, 739, point 05, times is a point six is 944343, so I think that everything's internally consistent. Now on this, on this here, then contract value. So we should theoretically be able to say that this number times 1.07, is 24 630, 508, which is the rounding difference? But that's good.

Unknown Speaker  12:05
2023, sorry. 2023, oh 23 what was the amount? Go back to it. Point 44, times 1.07 go back out. Yeah, we're an eight cent difference out, out on the right.

Matthias Miller  12:22
But if somebody doesn't, it's like, oh, you're it's, you're not counting sales tax, right? Okay, right. Contract balance is a wildly different number, 16 versus a

Unknown Speaker  12:44
What did you do?

Matthias Miller  12:47
Well, that's rental balance, not contract balance. What's the difference? Rental balance is the rent. The contract balance is Oh, includes

Unknown Speaker  12:59
any late fees

Matthias Miller  13:01
and CRA tax, but, but why is there that much? Is there literally $600 in late fees and CRA tax,

Speaker 1  13:15
so and it's why? Why wouldn't we? Why wouldn't we use this number out, out in the

Matthias Miller  13:22
because the number of months remaining months uses the rental balance

Unknown Speaker  13:27
got it. So then, why don't we put the rental balance on the contract?

Matthias Miller  13:31
Then, okay, here, let me make a list of

Speaker 1  13:35
I mean, I mean, I argue with me. Don't, don't, don't just, I mean, I'm I don't know. I so the 16, 321, includes sales tax, or does not include

Matthias Miller  13:48
sales this is a number. It includes tax, but it is a number I do not fully believe in.

Speaker 1  13:56
Okay, it does apply tax, so unpaid rental fees and unpaid late fees,

Matthias Miller  14:01
and see what it says. 56 cents in late fees. Okay, fine. I don't know where you're getting that number, but fine. Unpaid rental fees. 2626 like it does have three months of unpaid rent. 618, $100 or 684, almost seven times. Three is 21 almost about two grand.

Speaker 1  14:35
Okay, I don't, okay. I don't mind leaving it alone. For, for, for now what we're going to have to do when we get on the other side of the show is we're going to have to argue about consistent representation of numbers, right? And so to because, like, if, if you say, if you say, there's a balance somewhere, then the balance needs to agree everywhere. And. How we think about that balance needs to be clear. Yes, I think I think we can. I think we can. We can get away with this not 100% aligning. Show me how you verified that number. You Well, I mean, first off, you're clicking on the macro to see Yeah,

Matthias Miller  15:21
this number, yes, I'm not sure. I'm not sure how exactly I'm verifying the number. To be completely frank, like we

Speaker 1  15:28
think you dropped, you dropped the macros on the expression evaluator, and it'll tell you you were, you were doing that.

Matthias Miller  15:34
Okay, so this, this theoretically, 16, 321, 10 should be the rental balance. This does not match.

Unknown Speaker  15:49
Okay,

Unknown Speaker  15:52
so we're not so 16, 321, and we're saying out on the report, it's what,

Matthias Miller  15:57
15, 730, 105.

Unknown Speaker  16:01
Okay, well, well, this,

Speaker 1  16:04
grab your, grab your rental balance, contract rental balance out here, and drop that on your, on your expression evaluator, and see what.

Matthias Miller  16:15
This should be, zero and it's 582

Unknown Speaker  16:17
where's the what's the 582 is that the tax

Matthias Miller  16:24
so we're getting the contract value, okay, there's a few cent difference because of the how We're calculating contract value, which technically should be minus rental. Fees paid, which is the rental balance. Let's

Matthias Miller  16:56
see if we actually have unpaid late fees, because that just seems dumb that I don't 56 cents on a late fee does not make sense. That's, that's tax contract unpaid fees of type is, is screwing up tax.

Speaker 1  17:17
All I'm gonna samithias, is, I'm glad you're along for this ride, because you picked this stuff out so fast,

Matthias Miller  17:25
contact periods create contract period.

Matthias Miller  17:34
Due Date fees create period fees, amount paid, payment, total of type. See that's that is non taxable. I

Unknown Speaker  18:19
This is where your

Unknown Speaker  18:22
head wants to explode. No.

Matthias Miller  18:24
This is just okay. This is just with the full confession that I'm probably just being a little there's not a nice word for it, and I probably shouldn't be saying this to a client like this is where the immediate blame of, oh, this is a problem with a raise. Like, no, it's not you screwed up your tax calculation. Like, anyway,

Speaker 1  18:58
um, well, to be fair to Dear Jonathan, when you get into the when you get into the weeds of these, of these macro calculations, it's not always easy to keep your head

Matthias Miller  19:16
straight. No, and I, I would agree, like to his defense, you have to actually understand the business of rent to own to get the math right. Yeah. And I remember when I first came like, you're talking to visors. I'm like, This is stupid. Like, who uses divisors? That's just dumb. Well, it's just so easy. I mean, like, everything's easy, once you know it so true

Unknown Speaker  19:42
everything's not.

Unknown Speaker  20:35
Yeah, okay, okay, goodness,

Speaker 1  20:46
this guy's like, hitting the gas, and really likes the sound of his engine. It just kept going. Like, dude, you're in town. Like, I don't I'm not even sure where you found that much, not much pavement to actually stretch it out that long.

Unknown Speaker  21:02
That's funny.

Matthias Miller  21:05
Remaining months, months on the contract detail screen should have two decimals. Okay, so on contract balance, do you want to include late fees in CRA or do you just want to, I mean, you like this, right?

Speaker 1  21:26
Numbers, CRA tax, not, not the CRA the CRA tax, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, I like that calculation that that's, that's, that's a and maybe, maybe it is. Maybe we call it total contract balance, like I some of these balance.

Matthias Miller  21:44
Well, this is rental balance, sure. Um, do you want to show contract balance here, including tax?

Speaker 1  21:51
Okay, just take your, your head, out of the out of the we understand this RTO stuff inside and out now, but it's like, put yourself in the in the the individual customer service rep, who's like, rental balance, contract balance. What's the difference? Like, I don't understand, right? How can we create a good distinction there that it's easy to understand, so that that

Matthias Miller  22:21
well, one of the ways to do it is to actually, literally show the breakdown. It's almost like the Yeah,

Speaker 1  22:28
but it's really, it's really hard to show a breakdown. It's hard to show a breakdown on just a field label.

Matthias Miller  22:35
I mean, on the detail screen would be really easy. Would be to show a contract like a little ellipsis with a memo that says, Okay, here's

Speaker 1  22:44
the Oh, dude, I love that. I love that. I mean, frankly, I frankly, we ought to do a little ellipsis with a memo for contract value, contract balance. Like, if you can have a little ellipsis memo there, yeah, I love that idea. Do you

Matthias Miller  23:01
want to do it for the demo? Heck yeah. Can we? We can do anything. I had a very fun, fun conversation with Audra this morning. She's like, you and I look at deadlines differently. To me, the deadline is, hey, at least we're done and we don't have to think about it. To you, the deadline is like, oh, we have time to go do something else. Yeah, exactly. Or, or, like, deadlines are never final. Like, no,

Unknown Speaker  23:27
I'm like, and when you should be done, they are.

Matthias Miller  23:30
My wife looked at some of my flyers yesterday. She helped me redesign two of my flyers, which I'm really grateful for. And she's like, why didn't you ask me for my help earlier? Like, because I don't know. And then, and then I have, like, one other flyer. I'm like, I have to redesign this thing. And it's like, we get a time. I'll put it locally and throw them in my backpack. It's good anyway. Fun times. So let's do a, let's do a, how about we throw them in here, contract value, including tax,

Speaker 1  24:02
just memo, memo it, and that way they have something to go off

Unknown Speaker  24:05
of. Yes. Okay,

Matthias Miller  24:10
so here

Speaker 1  24:14
what we really want, first and foremost, if we're going to do this, I'm really, really tempted to put, to put both the rental balance and the contract balance in this in the same columns. And some both of them, that's really valuable information. And if they're memo, then it's really easy to pop open into settings and go, Okay, here's the actual here's, here's the breakdown for it.

Matthias Miller  24:35
I actually like you want the, do you want the full breakdown? Like, starting with effective value, how you get to the rental babies, how you get to the contract value? Yeah.

Speaker 1  24:47
I mean, so if we have these numbers in that, in that contract report, and it's memoed in the in the subset of each column, well then I guarantee you that i. What I'm going to end up doing is I'm going to pop it open and I'm going to, I'm going to going to explain these completely out. And one it gives you the opportunity to pop into settings and show people how this stuff works, and it also gives you an opportunity to really break it down.

Unknown Speaker  25:14
I'll agree that I really okay. Sorry.

Matthias Miller  25:17
I'm still knowing like, two steps behind. So this gives the breakdown on how you get to the monthly payment, right? Sure, but do we want this in a do we want this part or this part? Like, do we want to break some of these out

Speaker 1  25:41
into memos? No, this is, this is the output on this is pretty self explanatory. You have your effective value of your rental base, which, if there's a CRA those two numbers will be different, correct, right? Your contract value, um, 23 okay, and that contract value is not including tails sales tax, correct,

Matthias Miller  25:59
okay, right. But we could have a contract tax. No, it's not, because that's not how you get to the contract value, correct? That's right,

Speaker 1  26:07
monthly subtotal, 639, 54, and that it's pre tax as well. Monthly tax, damage fee, monthly payments, security deposit. No, that's that's all good. That's very, very easy to understand.

Matthias Miller  26:19
Okay, so even contract value you can get to from here, like we don't, do we really need anything for contract value? Or should it show, should it pop open a version of this? We can do that.

Speaker 1  26:29
Well, contract value at the at the on the detail screen there, if it's passed, like that number is, is a bit deceptive. No, no, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. No, I'm sorry. That's not That's not true. Sorry, I meant contract balance. Sorry, I got this dude mixed up.

Matthias Miller  26:49
Okay, now, do we want to show them? Do we want to show them rental balance or contract balance?

Unknown Speaker  26:59
Why not? Both.

Matthias Miller  27:07
Okay, so,

Speaker 1  27:09
no, okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Contract balance is correct here the con the contract balance includes if you were to pay that account to the very, very end, right today you would be, you would be paying 16,003 2166 that that on this detail screen makes sense out in the report, the contract search report is where I'm thinking we ought to put both of them, both end contract balance.

Matthias Miller  27:41
So I know this is wrong, but let's just go ahead and put in.

Speaker 1  27:47
Now what I was saying is, in the in the subset of the column, you go ahead and memo out exactly how that works,

Matthias Miller  27:56
like a tool tip, yeah.

Speaker 1  27:58
I mean, it's essentially, well, I mean, can you do a tool tip? Let's try it. You're saying you can do tool tips inside of

Unknown Speaker  28:09
Are you serious?

Matthias Miller  28:10
Let's try it,

Speaker 1  28:11
dude, this is freaking way.

Matthias Miller  28:15
So let's do contract balance, including tax.

Unknown Speaker  28:20
You may have just changed my life,

Matthias Miller  28:23
okay, I don't know if I could do multi line.

Unknown Speaker  28:40
Yeah, you can

Matthias Miller  28:42
so, and you can embed like, Okay, so let's do

Unknown Speaker  28:45
a condo. Freaking kidding me.

Matthias Miller  28:49
Do you know how awesome this is? Man, well, you can literally hover over these numbers and like, show me the math. Man, prove it.

Speaker 1  28:56
So wait, is it? Is it row dependent? Yeah.

Matthias Miller  29:01
I mean, you could do, you

Unknown Speaker  29:04
can do no freaking way.

Unknown Speaker  29:12
Holy

Speaker 1  29:13
moly. So you literally could do the breakdown right there, for right there. So for every single like you can you can text, break that dude, dude, dude. Okay, who do we get to thank for some of this is this new?

Matthias Miller  29:32
No, not new new. It's been around for a minute.

Unknown Speaker  29:38
Whole so much. How? Experience. Cow,

Speaker 1  29:46
yes, my my friend, build me an incredible tool tip that is, that is that is sick. All right,

Matthias Miller  29:55
let's start at the let's start at the left. Effective product, effective value. You?

Matthias Miller  30:08
Do you want to? Could we just do? I

Speaker 1  30:09
don't think effective values. We don't need a tool tip on that one contract value, I think we should term is self explanatory. CRA self explanatory. Security deposit is self explanatory. It's anywhere we get into somewhat nebulous, transactional stuff,

Matthias Miller  30:27
or, okay, let's try this. This

Speaker 2  30:42
is the kind of stuff. Of stuff that, oh, man, other softwares just don't do.

Matthias Miller  30:47
Well, it's so easy to do that's the crazy thing. Okay, so let's do this is low contract value. Tool Tip. Tool to

Speaker 1  31:02
your steak dinner is going to keep getting bigger the more you do this kind of stuff.

Matthias Miller  31:06
Come on, dude, don't hurt yourself.

Matthias Miller  31:14
Hang on. 684, 31, per month times 36 months equals. Do you want to? Do you have the equals portion of it, or not just the, sorry,

Speaker 1  31:34
did you see which? Yeah, I did. I'm just trying to think, um,

Speaker 1  31:45
I mean, I don't, I mean you're, you got your fit, you've got your mouse on the equals. I mean, it's right, that is the value. The question, yeah, no, no, I think that. So go down one.

Unknown Speaker  32:01
No way, no way.

Matthias Miller  32:07
Okay, so let's do contract balance now. So contract balance is

Matthias Miller  32:28
so we have, how do you want to represent this? Doesn't it make more sense to do more like

Matthias Miller  32:46
contract value, including tax.

Matthias Miller  33:09
If You would do more like

Speaker 1  33:38
F, can you go new line with some of this stuff to go vertical instead of horizontal? We could, yeah, it'll make it'll keep it a little bit more compact and readable.

Matthias Miller  33:58
What if we do something like I it.

Unknown Speaker  34:04
Yeah, now you're cooking.

Matthias Miller  34:26
You want to go through each of

Unknown Speaker  34:27
the fees, or just do late fees, think you're missing a comma at the end of your second row,

Unknown Speaker  34:31
third row, oh, here.

Matthias Miller  34:41
Value.

Speaker 1  34:46
Yeah, I mean, I mean, let's, let's, let's, let's Any, any, any late fees that are any in the, in the CRA tax? Yeah, let's just, let's just break it out.

Matthias Miller  36:06
Have a bit easier to Do a

Matthias Miller  36:33
so we have anything.

Matthias Miller  37:50
Contract value, all right, so we have the rental balance, which is totally bogus. Now this contract balance, we have an extra space, but a contract value minus rent paid, 24 635, minus plus unpaid late fee balance of 56 cents.

Speaker 1  38:13
And that's because of that, because they didn't we didn't pay the tax on it when we paid the actual fee.

Unknown Speaker  38:17
Yeah, it's no big deal.

Matthias Miller  38:23
I mean, I think John's I'll fix it, but then the contract balance macro should include all unpaid fees

Unknown Speaker  38:30
itemized

Matthias Miller  38:33
Well, or currently the macro only includes late fees.

Unknown Speaker  38:36
Oh, sure. I

Matthias Miller  38:43
do you want it to include all I mean,

Unknown Speaker  38:48
you're 100% correct. Yeah. Okay.

Speaker 1  39:26
Dude, I cannot wait to have that up on a big screen and be like, Okay, this number right here, put your mouse on top of it. Pop, Bing.

Matthias Miller  39:49
Okay, so, is there anything?

Unknown Speaker  39:50
Why wouldn't you say including tax and fees for the header?

Unknown Speaker  40:00
Ah, see now, now we're now we're getting somewhere. 24

Matthias Miller  40:08
Hey, 24 635,

Matthias Miller  40:18
okay, something is wrong with my June. May use my phone. That's fine.

Matthias Miller  40:38
24 635, 66 66 minus 263494,

Matthias Miller  40:51
plus 56, cents, which is wrong, 22,000 that's

Matthias Miller  41:36
16, 321, but we think that's all tax stuff. I can't tell whether this I can't tell whether this expression is right until he fixes his tax stuff. Um,

Matthias Miller  41:55
okay, rental balance. Then

Matthias Miller  42:03
it should basically be this guy.

Matthias Miller  42:33
2422

Unknown Speaker  42:36
what the that

Unknown Speaker  42:39
doesn't

Unknown Speaker  42:45
what are we subtracting out of here? That's not correct.

Matthias Miller  42:52
Contract value we said, is 24,000

Matthias Miller  43:01
we have 8000 paid. The tooltip says, Well, this is the unpaid amount. Wow, that's just dumb.

Unknown Speaker  43:12
You have that in the in the other tool tip as well.

Matthias Miller  43:19
Oh, you know what, I bet it is yeah,

Matthias Miller  43:26
that would probably make a difference.

Matthias Miller  43:33
Why would we just Yeah? That's fine. Why would we just do this?

Unknown Speaker  43:45
To turn into a macro.

Matthias Miller  44:01
And even on this guy, I'm

Speaker 1  44:27
when you when you have that, when you have when you do another. I don't know if you can actually do this when you put your mouse over on the tool tip. And can you get a screenshot of that so I can send it to Leanne.

Matthias Miller  44:41
I can't, but you can.

Unknown Speaker  44:42
Okay, yes, I can.

Unknown Speaker  44:46
Where is my thingy majiggy. Hold on. Give me. Just bear with me one second. Capture, capture, capture, thank you, sir. I guess. Send that to her contract.

Matthias Miller  45:03
These still don't match, because he's this contract rental balance is wrong.

Matthias Miller  45:29
We'll get there. So then the rental balance is pretty simple, like, that's just contract value minus rent paid. Of we should put the negative in there.

Unknown Speaker  45:40
Where's my screenshots going?

Matthias Miller  45:44
You have to wait for them to save, and then they go on your downloads.

Speaker 1  45:48
No, it's, it's my own fault. I have it currently going to the clipboard, and I forgot to, I forgot where I put it.

Unknown Speaker  46:22
That I'm still

Speaker 1  46:39
the nuances of where Mac puts things in, versus where PCs put things. And do

Matthias Miller  46:52
you want the payment? Amount, breakdown

Unknown Speaker  46:56
payment, the monthly payment,

Matthias Miller  46:58
monthly payment.

Unknown Speaker  47:07
No, but we probably should do the EPO one. I

Matthias Miller  47:10
was trying to procrastinate on the EPO one. You

Speaker 1  47:17
the payment amount. One's pretty easy to go defend. I mean, okay, granted the payment amount one would be kind of cool to do. We'll do that one as well, but

Speaker 2  47:27
the EPO one is going to be even less fun.

Matthias Miller  47:40
Okay, so then we have,

Matthias Miller  47:52
I feel like it's going to reveal holes in our character. This is what I love, though, like there is no hiding precisely.

Speaker 1  48:04
And this is, and this is what, this is, what gets me really geeked out about this, because to be able to be to defend, well, okay, so one of the things I really want to do, well, and once you've, once you've done this, the descriptions on the macros need to do some very, very similar stuff about, you know, obviously you can't do the calculation stuff inside the description the macro. Can you No, right, but you can. But you can say, you know, contract value minus, but the you know, kind

Matthias Miller  48:37
of a right. But we could, we could show the same thing with the little ellipsis button.

Speaker 1  48:41
Yes, exactly that. And that needs to be done, because this is one of the, one of the things I really, really, really, really, really, really get annoyed at inside of RTO pro is that you never can you never you're always guessing at defending a number, putting this, that information right in front of somebody. Yeah, be like, here, I think ellipsis or put your mouse on top of this. It's going to defend the number for you.

Matthias Miller  49:09
Philosophical moment, I think increasingly, the future belongs to truth tellers, transparent truth tellers. And if you're willing to say, look, here are the numbers. Shoot a hole in it. I don't care if I'm wrong, we'll fix it.

Unknown Speaker  49:25
Is that wrong? You'll fix

Speaker 1  49:30
it. Hey, wisdom moment for the day. If I'm wrong, I'll fix it. If you're wrong, you

Unknown Speaker  49:36
fix it. Yeah, that's deep

Unknown Speaker  49:41
in that though. I up.

Matthias Miller  49:49
Okay, so here's where this part of the reason I was I didn't want to do this is because I feel like our calculations are so screwed up, like we came up with a way to come up to that with the right. Number, but like the

Matthias Miller  50:12
let's do something like this. So

Speaker 1  50:15
side, side, small rant, yeah, I I wish Seth wouldn't have delegated some of this to Jonathan, because Seth is really, really sharp on this stuff. But that's besides the point.

Matthias Miller  50:29
I, I would agree. I would agree

Speaker 1  50:36
it's not, it's I'm not, I'm not upset about it. Hear me clearly. This is this. This is part of the the digging all the moles out of the woodwork. But one thing I know about ever working with Seth is he will make sure his numbers are spot on, to the point that when we questioned him one time on on payroll module stuff, he was he was so adamant and defensive on it that it was funny,

Matthias Miller  51:02
and he was gleeful at proving you wrong. Yes, pleased his punch to be right, whereas for Jonathan, Jonathan is a dreamy, creative type, and he would much rather be, I don't know you can tell here his, it's his heart's just not in it the same way, it's, um, it's fine, different people. Okay, so

Speaker 1  51:25
he says they should be fixed. Now, do you want to? Do you want to? Do you want to save this off and push an

Matthias Miller  51:29
update and find out? Yeah, I do, actually, because that would help us a lot. I'm always paranoid about not saving it completely perfectly, but it looks saved all right.

Matthias Miller  51:51
And let me just make sure the build server updated to the two's changes, because if you get too fast in a hurry, it doesn't always 592, 925920,

Matthias Miller  52:06
man, this is big. See, this is what I want we do. Ran for a little bit difference of perspective, but this is what the we we hit the deadline and we're done. People don't get they don't get freebies like this. They would also say we don't we. They don't get the chaos that we create.

Speaker 1  52:33
But listen, listen, you and I are going to agree on this. 100% of the time you are preaching to the choir, my friend, you are preaching to the choir. It's a good

Matthias Miller  52:44
thing, but it's a good thing. Leanne and Audra are part of this conversation

Speaker 1  52:47
like this, this right here would drive some people just to needing a therapist.

Matthias Miller  52:57
Well, I'm learning. I'm learning to get better at like, at some point you just gotta shoulder your why at some point you just gotta shoulder the weight of responsibility So you don't drive completely people, completely insane. All right?

Matthias Miller  53:27
I should get rid of these changes.

Matthias Miller  53:41
This is a dumb text only differ that yours truly implemented because it was cheap.

Matthias Miller  53:57
Okay, but like this, like I anyway,

Matthias Miller  54:09
can we at least call it total amount paid or amount paid total? If I were a code reviewer on this job, I would have a kicks and giggles.

Unknown Speaker  54:26
Okay, I

Speaker 1  54:30
one of the things I think I probably should say out loud, then, is that? Well, I guess it depends on on, okay, remember this, we want to make sure that macros and inside of macros and assignments inside of of these things are understandable, so that when users get their fingers in here and start trying to build them a report, they're not completely confused. So it may be, it may be worth being pershnikity about the. This?

Matthias Miller  55:00
Yeah, right. I think, I think I'm going to Do this. I'm

Matthias Miller  55:28
uh, would just say that

Unknown Speaker  56:16
call, yes, I am zoom call What's up about?

Unknown Speaker  56:33
Can't talk to you about after this. Yes, thank you.

Matthias Miller  56:38
But really,

Matthias Miller  56:57
Nicholas, that sounds exactly right.

Unknown Speaker  57:02
Oh. That's funny.

Matthias Miller  57:07
We're glad we're on the same page. Okay, so the

Speaker 1  57:13
only thing I would probably add to that message to Ellis is that, and I don't care if you reference me, but Seth's attention, to detail on these things is really valuable. It really is. Yeah, I

Matthias Miller  57:33
mean, if I you had to give me one person, that'd be the perfect compliment to me. I could only pick one dev to go build projects with. I can tell you exactly who I pick. We could do. We couldn't do whiskey stuff, because that's not his lane. But working with SAS is a dream.

Speaker 1  57:59
So my, my experience with core componentry is that he just is very, very, very attentive to detail and and it just, he gets it right

Matthias Miller  58:13
when it's not just attentive to detail. He also has a he has he has the gift to he has the design gift as well, like how to structure, organize things so that they're understandable. That was, that was one of the Father's son. He is his father's son. It was, that was one of the things that I love working with Josh, because Josh would get me unstuck for my overthinking, yeah, and I would, I would finesse his haphazard, knock it out, quick ideas. It was, really wasn't a good synergy. Still, is we just don't use it much, okay, effective product value. We have contract value tax, so that one didn't the contract value, including tax.

Speaker 2  59:06
Why would, why would rental? Should rent? No, I'm getting ready to get there. Okay, I

Matthias Miller  59:11
was wondering the same thing.

Speaker 1  59:20
Well, some of these macro changes automatically change the whiskey stuff that Jonathan did?

Matthias Miller  59:25
Hey, if he's if he's grabbing the right macro? Yes, okay.

Matthias Miller  59:42
Term length, security deposit, contract balance. Okay, so how is he getting to

Matthias Miller  59:55
so now contract balance, we don't have late fees on here. We don't have any unpaid fees, that's why. But here we do,

Unknown Speaker  1:00:11
yeah, cuz I just pulled up Theresa Beck Hinkle,

Unknown Speaker  1:00:15
and

Unknown Speaker  1:00:18
I'm showing a contract balance on the ticket payment page is 14,000 402.

Matthias Miller  1:00:25
Okay, let's, let's, let's make the sticky note to get back to the sure payment page. It really feels like waffling right now. Eight, okay, but what fee? There's an $8 fee incurred, which would be $8 he's taxing. He's taxing. Okay, 57 30.5 minus

Speaker 1  1:00:59
27 question before the changes you saved is that, is that back on the user report with the tool tip in

Matthias Miller  1:01:05
Yeah, it's only user it's the user report. He is okay. Are these late fees marked Okay? Late fees are marked taxable in the system. Do you want to mark? Want me to mark them all untaxed, non taxable. We could leave them taxable. It's

Matthias Miller  1:01:30
going to mess up EPOS if I change the taxability and payment amounts. I

Unknown Speaker  1:01:51
don't know how to answer your question,

Matthias Miller  1:01:58
as in, it'd be kind of good too, but it's a lot of work.

Speaker 1  1:02:01
Good to what? Untaxed all the late fees, right? Why would it be a good thing to untax all the late fees?

Matthias Miller  1:02:07
I don't know. Okay, if you're fine having it taxable, that's I'm fine with that. I just want to make sure I'm not doing anything dumb.

Unknown Speaker  1:02:17
I mean, for the moment, I think it's fine. Okay? I think.

Matthias Miller  1:02:28
Okay. So then here we have, so then EPO, okay, so, so we think now contract balance and rental balance. So if we go over here, I mean, at least they're matching 57, 3050, then we have the monthly payment.

Speaker 1  1:02:44
Yeah, but the numbers don't work. What's wrong with okay, I'm on three Teresa, the very top one good on rental balance, if you say 24 630, 5.16 minus 88 96.0 96.03 that's 15, 739,

Matthias Miller  1:03:06
okay, if you go, if Theresa, you go, oh. These numbers, the tool tip. Numbers, yes, 24, 635, minus rent paid. Two.

Matthias Miller  1:03:36
Okay, which number is wrong.

Speaker 1  1:03:38
Well, just do the math manual. If you do the 24 635, 16 minus the 88 9603 does not come out to 17 463,

Matthias Miller  1:03:49
28 here before 635, 16 minus, not times minus 889, 6.0, 315, 315

Matthias Miller  1:04:06
contract, oh, it's because we're using the wrong taxable value here.

Matthias Miller  1:04:20
Contract value

Matthias Miller  1:04:30
I'm getting certain I am this close to just taking it and fixing it myself,

Speaker 1  1:04:38
because it's so okay, the proper way to actually do this calculation would be contract value without sales tax minus rent paid without sales tax, equaling the balance plus sales tax. Because you don't, I don't think you're going to get the same number if you do taxable amount minus taxable amount equals tax. Maximal balance. Maybe no you would never mind ignore what I'm saying I'm might be stupid today.

Matthias Miller  1:05:27
Contract Value.

Matthias Miller  1:05:38
15 739 15 739,

Unknown Speaker  1:05:43
13, you didn't save yet? Yeah, I think that's right.

Matthias Miller  1:05:47
It. Yeah. No, I did.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:56
24, 630, 5.16,

Unknown Speaker  1:06:00
minus, 88, 96.0, 315, 739, 13, yes. Now your country, your contract, balance is still, is not correct yet.

Matthias Miller  1:06:18
Or did you balance

Speaker 1  1:06:21
because on, on three, Theresa back Hinkle, those the 15, 739, should be on both those columns. I

Matthias Miller  1:06:33
don't understand how he's getting to this.

Matthias Miller  1:06:48
It seems to me like

Speaker 1  1:07:22
Not to disparage Jonathan and all his hard work, but I'm about to ask you to go review all of these things and make sure they're right, because I feel like you have you know exactly where we want to

Matthias Miller  1:07:30
go. I am. I think I need to literally jump in the code and fix some of this stuff. I just I'm very not. It's not working, all right.

Speaker 1  1:07:40
So then there's no reason for me to hang around here if you're going to go, Okay, let me, let me say this clearly, I would appreciate if you would go do that.

Matthias Miller  1:07:48
I will go do that. Okay, I am going to go disappear. I'm going to go get myself a nice, warm, heartwarming drink at the poorhouse, and I'm going to go knock this stuff out.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:59
Okay?

Speaker 1  1:08:01
And then, if you want to, if you want to jump back on later and go back through some of this, let me

Matthias Miller  1:08:05
know. Yes, I will, but I'm gonna go throw on headphones. Fix it. I appreciate it. Yeah. Bye.
