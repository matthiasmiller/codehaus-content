I'm thinking more about how I email I think one of the biggest fears about email is that I want to wait to not use stuff. And, and I think, I think that's the biggest thing about not losing stuff. Now there's something that can be put on my calendar, that's great. I can deal with that. But if there is something that. requires needs to go somewhere else like where do I put that so that I don't lose it. I think the only thing I know to do is literally, to have my calendar be the source of truth and push these things out to when I think I actually shouldn't be dealing with it, instead of just putting them on hold and waiting, you know, waiting on it. So I think that's a, an interesting kind of observation for this whole process. So, part of the question with where I'm going with processing my email is this question where. Well first of all it's kind of the question of where does this thing go. But beyond that, there's also this question of what do I need to do to make sure I don't lose it because that's actually the underlying here that is driving so much of what's actually what's actually going on here. So I think that's actually a core fear. And if I can address the issue of not losing stuff, then processing my inbox becomes a lot easier. You
