Unknown Speaker  01:20
Good morning. Good morning Ben

Unknown Speaker  01:47
you should be joining shortly

Unknown Speaker  01:48
I just got off the newbies call with him so

Unknown Speaker  01:52
sounds good

Unknown Speaker  02:10
bias Hey good morning Tim

Unknown Speaker  02:20
I've already been on two other calls with Ben morning so he doesn't even a good morning

Unknown Speaker  02:32
not giving my brotherly cold shoulder any

Unknown Speaker  02:44
All right, so

Speaker 1  02:52
the idea here is to try to cram a whole bunch of stuff in the half an hour. And then spend some time working on this. So see how that goes. First off some stuff. Just a few questions for you, Matthias here in the EB proposal? Yes, so. TVS is 771. We just talked with David Thoreau this morning for a few questions, questions for them. So good evening, again, and send off those of you questions to wrap up.

Speaker 1  04:01
So some of the sets of stuff we've been working on LSVT since he's out try to get a few getting input you to wrap up. So we actually talked with you about this one on the on this bookings report. We have these two filters, how they tell you loaded start date and date that we're applying to the right theme of this multi pane report. Everything else was playing to the left pane. And there's a question on how it would work if there was one tally on a booking that was already kind of been loaded and the rest haven't. Anyway talked with them. We're now saying that the silo to start date is for left pane if you turn all bookings in the left pane that have at least one export tally with a loaded date in that range. Just want to make sure that you're good for or, and then on the below to date is on the export Tality which is the right thing. But we're filtering the left by by that.

Matthias Miller  05:14
That's fair. So the right pane will still show everything

Speaker 1  05:20
right the right pane will still show everything. We're cool. Sounds good here. Okay. And then also just wanted to clarify if for some reason some reason they would select multiple rows in the left pane. My right that if we only wanted to show tallies for one booking, is it showing the tallies for the booking that they clicked first when they started dragging through I selected first or is it the top one on the list? I guess I could word

Matthias Miller  05:56
do you have a multi pane that they could?

Unknown Speaker  06:16
Type looks like it actually

Speaker 1  06:34
the last the bottom one go to go

Unknown Speaker  06:44
Yeah, it looks like the last one selected

Matthias Miller  06:49
well if you use the shift arrows up and down it used it Yeah, the last one selected which is what I would expect to see.

Unknown Speaker  06:57
So the rows have a concept of where you'll see this in

Matthias Miller  07:03
Excel for example, Excel will have multiple cells selected but there's only one that's an active cell

Unknown Speaker  07:08
right

Matthias Miller  07:13
and this works in the same way

Speaker 1  07:19
yep okay that what I needed

Unknown Speaker  07:42
all right

Unknown Speaker  07:50
men's reports

Speaker 1  07:59
so we are replacing some there have been a whole bunch of buttons for the payments reports for printing the PDFs and generating the file files, we've moved most of those into just to be links here on the inline in the report. Okay most of them they print off individually anyway it's easier to control click right here and Rodin is this I said that this opens in a new tab is that is that correct? That

Matthias Miller  08:46
not automatically mean they can Control click for a new tab. Okay. I think the only reason it might do that as if it's an editable report and even that I'm not 100% sure that

Unknown Speaker  09:01
okay. Yeah

Unknown Speaker  09:16
so let's take out the new tab

Unknown Speaker  09:26
and then

Unknown Speaker  09:35
Okay, so the stuff up here was that so the landowner payments and logger payments are easy enough because those they just do individually.

Speaker 1  09:48
And yeah, that's fine. Just put the links in like the the vendor events do report. Yes, more fun. because they sometimes print them individually and sometimes print them in batch batches. Sometimes they put off only five of them at a time LS had said that we could either do they want to print them in batch we can create them all all the separate PDFs with them in a zip file and they can download and then have all the different PDF files or we can do one at a time give them the option so here he wants both but pretty important to him to have the crewman bash to have them all on one in one file that you can just click Print once and it prints out 25 You know all 25 of them together

Speaker 1  10:56
so what we're hearing here from Ellis the other day it doesn't sound like that possible

Speaker 1  11:09
he said if if we just can't explain that we've got some limitations or PDF generation they said if you can't do it all together then the file is okay. But just wondering if there's any way to merge to say okay, I've got 2525 of these summaries want to merge them all together into one one big long PDF documents I can get them all out do you know if your capability to do that

Unknown Speaker  11:52
you're not sure where we couldn't

Unknown Speaker  12:07
so we have

Matthias Miller  12:09
is this okay, we're showing we're all summaries for the current report everything that's included in the report

Matthias Miller  12:21
are we printing all summaries for everything that's shown in the report?

Unknown Speaker  12:27
Or are they selecting them to be printing he would like to you would like to print all unpaid. So we're grouping by status or by paid and unpaid here if you'd like to print summaries for all eight

Speaker 1  12:56
but I think we could we could have in select multiple well if we just want to see Alice's comment

Speaker 1  13:09
and we're Ellis had given a little bit more context

Speaker 1  13:27
I'm not sure maybe it was just these like there's another summary situation and the bookings report but I'm not sure if Ellis has comments. I remember that one concern I think when he had was with a page numbering you're doing 123123 You're starting over the page numbering for each

Speaker 1  13:57
but I'd be curious to hear it from his perspective if we would take away the page numbering if that would resolve the issue

Matthias Miller  14:06
the page numbering concern makes sense

Unknown Speaker  14:22
I have a hard time seeing why. Anything else would

Matthias Miller  14:30
like especially if you just had a

Unknown Speaker  14:32
print all

Speaker 1  14:40
print unpaid print all unpaid.

Matthias Miller  14:46
Why would be that much of an issue to

Speaker 1  14:52
combine that into a zip file into zip file with just one everything into one I'm sorry that is a file into a single single PDF it'll be Yeah

Speaker 1  15:38
Is this something I can just actually get Ellison is one been rattling through it today? Yeah,

Matthias Miller  15:48
I think I think what I would do is I would mean if you're good with this I would propose a a print, you know unpaid summaries that combines them all into PDF, write the proposal like that and then give Ellis a chance to shoot it down

Unknown Speaker  16:12
don't take the page numbers out

Matthias Miller  16:18
well, we might not be able to include page numbers at all if page numbers are an issue

Speaker 1  16:51
Okay, Now one other thing that makes it complicated that more is that what we're doing here is not sort of those first two the landowner payments and the logger payments, we were printing payment summaries. So we're printing a summary of the payment in the left. What we're doing for the vendors is not the payment summary but it's the yard tellers tally summary. So there will be times that they're already even if we just print it for one payment, there would be three yard tally summaries just for that one payment and those get printed on a per yard tally basis. That'd be fair, I mean

Matthias Miller  17:40
the entire PDF would be summaries of yard tallies based on a payment and is a payment summary interspersed with your daily summaries or is it just your daily summaries?

Unknown Speaker  17:50
It's just the archives though

Matthias Miller  17:52
I mean I don't think that's an issue it's just a matter of how we subset them but again

Unknown Speaker  18:00
I mean I feel a little

Matthias Miller  18:01
hesitant making I feel a little hesitant making promises

Unknown Speaker  18:06
without deeply understanding what yeah yeah yeah understand

Unknown Speaker  18:31
just something I just

Unknown Speaker  18:55
okay, yeah, we'll plan to do that then. Proposal for LS in their

Speaker 1  19:09
next one, this is the booking summary email that has the link or links, the photos, the expert tallies for the booking. We were planning already to include the booking ID in the in the link itself. Since the links the photographing for yards, I'm sorry for export tally bases. We also include the export tally ID and the link okay. So if we would do something like

Speaker 1  19:56
that Sure work or does it work better? Start with the image ID. No, I'm gonna prefer the I prefer the top down approach. Like less specific,

Matthias Miller  20:10
the more specific technically booking ID and export tele ID. I mean export value ID is going to be unique across all extra tallies. So booking Id really is superfluous. I think the only reason for including that and the image ID

Unknown Speaker  20:27
is so that Well, I don't know if it matters you could potentially have multiple images for export tally. So you would want to have image ID in addition to that, export tally Id

Speaker 1  20:48
sure. Yes, booking ID is basically there for is extra information or for reference

Unknown Speaker  21:09
so then this will be an FYI for LS.

Speaker 1  21:24
Then the next question, is wondering if we can use hyperlinks to email body rather than displaying the full the full link if we can just have a list to say, list of the X Portelli IDs? And those are hyperlinks to images rather than showing the whole

Unknown Speaker  21:48
URL there yes

Unknown Speaker  21:58
we can I mean, the

Unknown Speaker  22:03
template ends up looking something like

Unknown Speaker  22:21
in the template.

Speaker 1  22:34
Okay, so basically like we do in our hosting here, yep.

Speaker 1  22:53
So they're thinking that, that if we can include the ideas in the link, and if we can do the hyperlinks, they would just do a list of hyperlinks rather than the single link to two landing pages thumbnails. Yeah. Now the one thing is that if again, if there are, if there are multiple images for export tally, we have to think of a convention for that. I guess new, we just show export tally dash image ID or something like that. Sorry, if what if there are multiple images for for the same export tally, instead of being able to just show load number one as the link we'd have to say load load number one dash 1234 The number one dash 1235. There multiple. So we'd probably have the hyperlink show the load ID, id plus the image ID.

Unknown Speaker  24:21
So like, yeah.

Matthias Miller  24:27
What do you want to you want the image IDs to be?

Unknown Speaker  24:37
That's fair. How do

Matthias Miller  24:38
you want the image IDs?

Unknown Speaker  24:46
Do they have to be auto numbered? 1234 I guess we could it's going to be stored in that. We can put them in however there, whatever that number is.

Matthias Miller  25:01
If we're just showing the Italia the image ID no problem it's easy

Unknown Speaker  25:05
okay yeah

Unknown Speaker  25:13
okay

Unknown Speaker  25:47
okay

Speaker 1  26:00
alright yeah we'll move on from that for now and then comes to price yes and the email stuff up there has been CWA step here but maybe we should go ahead and jump at December's keep that rolling and then go on to the change requests there as we so sim is I'm tracking is 7435

Unknown Speaker  26:47
what would be

Unknown Speaker  26:55
best way to tackle this jump into

Speaker 1  27:13
should we have been and I've been working on it some last few days working on hashing out how to do things and he's been working on filling in details with a proposal would it be best have been just give a quick overview of where where things are at how things line up between the proposal and sigma wireframe just

Unknown Speaker  27:43
makes sense

Unknown Speaker  27:45
we're on the right track yep yeah

Unknown Speaker  27:57
the proposal on your wireframe

Unknown Speaker  28:20
I need access to screen sharing then.

Unknown Speaker  28:25
Interesting Am I that I am those Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  28:54
Though

Unknown Speaker  28:59
just trying to catch up here for a second. All right.

Unknown Speaker  29:01
Quick overview.

Speaker 2  29:07
These settings these are just basically settings permissions

Unknown Speaker  29:17
that

Speaker 2  29:19
yeah, they can turn them on or off. Or both their notification thing or their emails. And their different between Super Admin and member.

Unknown Speaker  29:38
And so,

Speaker 2  29:40
yeah, in the proposal here, we have them separated between

Unknown Speaker  29:46
notification and email. And then I put

Speaker 2  29:49
or we put Yeah, for Super Admin users and for members. And there's since the different

Speaker 1  30:02
Record there's a lot of stuff in there that we need clarification on from

Unknown Speaker  30:13
clients contact record

Unknown Speaker  30:17
is basically their members directory if I remember right, but I've moved that oh yeah, I know it's in the contract one note on that

Matthias Miller  30:40
the member bio I'm gonna guess is a custom

Unknown Speaker  30:46
field not reusing a standard field custom

Unknown Speaker  31:00
Yeah, that would be a custom field yes on an app posting the standard fields

Matthias Miller  31:14
so we should have a section that says yeah, I would just move short bio from the top section down to actually editing this thing. So you could okay you're gonna make that change you're welcome to

Unknown Speaker  31:50
Yeah, so yeah, they

Unknown Speaker  31:53
do have on the

Unknown Speaker  31:57
wireframe for their

Speaker 2  32:00
profiles if they one little profile picture. Something that Tinder wanted to know how easy or difficult it is to include and then whether or not they

Unknown Speaker  32:11
actually how important it is to have it on there.

Speaker 2  32:18
Yeah, so just something to keep in mind at some point. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  32:24
I mean, the very short answer to that is it's pretty simple. We might want to have instructions for people because we don't want them to upload it as an attachment we want them to embed it directly into the memo and so they would think that with just simple instructions be

Unknown Speaker  32:41
fine okay

Speaker 2  32:49
this is bound so once again, we kind of we put stuff from both wireframes in here but then we did verify that some of this is admin only versus everyone and so yeah, growth ring record is

Speaker 1  33:17
your Yeah, absolutely. Is the growth ring

Speaker 2  33:21
details on the wireframe? It's all that and then it is also

Speaker 1  33:33
the groups Yes, it is the group's section from Super Admin

Speaker 2  33:56
then action items record once again

Unknown Speaker  34:02
links from

Unknown Speaker  34:06
growth rank action items

Speaker 1  34:10
with all of this data in it

Speaker 2  34:18
I don't think Yeah, super admin does not have a section for that. That's members only. development resource record

Unknown Speaker  34:32
is

Speaker 2  34:37
this development resource page, which the Super Admin has the exact same page except for they have reject and approved buttons. Nope, that's, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  34:54
that's wrong. 10 members

Unknown Speaker  35:00
directory, this is for oh, this is something that he had sent an

Unknown Speaker  35:09
email about what he had wanted. But that would

Speaker 2  35:14
I believe is the same thing as the network directory and the members. wireframe.

Unknown Speaker  35:25
Yeah. Growth ranges reports

Unknown Speaker  35:35
this is this one I believe is now oh, that's

Unknown Speaker  35:45
the Super Admin

Matthias Miller  35:59
so do you know if a group growth ring? Is that a group? Or is that

Unknown Speaker  36:04
a monthly event? Growth Rate?

Speaker 2  36:08
Is this is it? This is the group? Yeah, so growth ring is a group they have a lot of different terms for a lot of the same things. Is what we've been slowly figuring out. So on the Super Admin thing, everything is described as groups. And then on the members side of thing, things, everything is described as growth rings.

Speaker 1  36:34
From what I've been able to figure out.

Speaker 2  36:45
Yes, so this would be this the growth rings report. I need to put in there that it's only but yeah, it's the group's section from the wireframe.

Speaker 1  37:04
Action report is.

Unknown Speaker  37:26
Oh, that is

Unknown Speaker  37:30
this right here again, from the growth rates action items,

Unknown Speaker  37:37
I believe. So.

Matthias Miller  37:42
Is that on a per individual basis? This

Speaker 2  37:46
Yes, we believe so. Because this is where they have like goals that they want to achieve for that month.

Speaker 1  37:56
And so, yeah, so like they answer some kind of a

Speaker 2  38:04
goal that they want to achieve with their faith with their family with their friends, stuff like that. And then they have a penalty dollar amount that they have to pay to the rest of their group slash growth

Unknown Speaker  38:14
rate if they don't meet that goal.

Speaker 2  38:20
So yes, this is a per individual thing

Speaker 1  38:24
that the should do.

Speaker 2  38:32
Element resource report don't have anything there. Dashboards. They are different. I haven't transferred the data over for the Super Admin yet. But the Yeah, this is a straightforward this is just

Unknown Speaker  38:50
the dashboard in the members page. has everything in it that

Speaker 2  39:01
goes from there except one thing that we need to clarify with the clients is that he mentioned in the email that he wanted a calendar and from what I could understand it's going to be something regarding most likely this Ruth rings section, maybe these boxes down here, but I highly doubt it. But probably something like this. That has like a meeting date and stuff like that. But that's just something we need to clarify with the clients. If it's the same as the growth run section, where if you wanted other stuff added to

Unknown Speaker  39:40
it. Yeah. So there's that.

Speaker 2  39:49
Let me read resources. Once again, this is all stuff that is just shown here in the dashboard. Growth rain resource list.

Unknown Speaker  40:06
We believe our I believe

Unknown Speaker  40:07
is the

Unknown Speaker  40:11
development resources. This

Speaker 2  40:16
the bottom ones here are the ones are Yeah, referring resource list books slash impact sheet knowledge tree, investor, deal room room. Those are ones that I believe are ones that he said they wanted to include, like in the email that that you sent over. And so I've been kind of doing a little bit of cross referencing. And yeah, what their names in the wireframe are different from what their names in the email. But from what I've been able to figure out from his descriptions in the email, that would be the development resources.

Unknown Speaker  40:56
Book impact sheets,

Speaker 2  41:00
I believe is the investment opportunities. And then also, the ask where Wait, is that the ask questions? Now, that would be the investor deal room is what I think is the ask questions and investment opportunities pages.

Unknown Speaker  41:23
Seems to be a combination of those impacts sheets.

Unknown Speaker  41:39
Back to

Speaker 2  41:41
Yes, the, from what I understood it would be the resource impact worksheet

Unknown Speaker  41:48
just from his description

Speaker 2  41:55
could also be considered adult development resources. So need some clarification on that. Knowledge tree, the most straightforward one,

Unknown Speaker  42:07
as far as lining up with the descriptions,

Speaker 2  42:13
but also the most complicated one as far as figuring out what goes where and what does what? Because we've got all sorts of drop lists, but then that's one. That one doesn't do anything. But then it just Yeah, clicking around takes you to a whole bunch of different places. And it

Unknown Speaker  42:37
took a little bit to kind of figure that one out. But yeah, as far as names go, that's the only one

Speaker 2  42:43
that fully lined up. And then these alerts are just what would pop up in their notifications. These are the only ones that we've seen so far new development resource new investment opportunity.

Unknown Speaker  43:01
Or in the

Speaker 2  43:05
Super Admin, there's also one that talks about offloading,

Unknown Speaker  43:09
meeting links.

Matthias Miller  43:12
But presumably there there's also I mean, there's also the notifications that were listed up in the list in the contacts as

Speaker 2  43:17
well, I presume, presumably, yes, there would be all of the switch. He had like this is just straight from

Speaker 1  43:26
the notifications, settings

Speaker 2  43:32
that just have some of these that imply that there would be underlying notifications beneath each one, but we don't know what they are. Sure. We just need clients to clarify what those would be.

Speaker 1  43:46
So you could have a good point, you can make a note and sorry to interrupt there. But you need to note in the alert section about that, that there are other notifications mentioned in the contact. Let's do that. And yeah.

Unknown Speaker  44:10
Put that down as you do for the client probably.

Unknown Speaker  44:14
Yeah, yeah. Sorry. I didn't mean to derail what you're saying. Now you're good.

Unknown Speaker  44:40
So yeah,

Speaker 2  44:41
that's a pretty quick overview of everything that we've moved over from the data points so far. There's a couple more in there that I still need to move over.

Unknown Speaker  44:55
But yeah,

Unknown Speaker  44:59
let's kind of where we're at right now I think I have

Speaker 1  45:01
most of these main ones. Actually no, not these. These down here. I have the links,

Speaker 2  45:14
go to that direct page to kind of see what I was able to figure

Unknown Speaker  45:18
out what it seems like

Unknown Speaker  45:22
he was talking about from the email.

Unknown Speaker  45:26
But then with

Speaker 2  45:29
these, I don't have the link moves over yet, but I could if that's going to be

Unknown Speaker  45:36
more helpful

Unknown Speaker  45:43
probably one of

Matthias Miller  45:43
my big questions here

Unknown Speaker  46:13
What was your question again? I said I could

Speaker 2  46:19
take the links and put them over in the developer specification areas.

Unknown Speaker  46:26
That connects most to

Speaker 2  46:28
whatever's in that section, if that would be helpful down the road. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  46:34
it's possible, I don't really know for sure. They one of my big questions

Speaker 1  46:39
is like, life isn't like goals. Core values.

Matthias Miller  46:53
Yeah, you actually have this mentioned here, how often with a user change, these are any of those or any of those documented

Unknown Speaker  47:01
anywhere, it's on the dashboard.

Speaker 2  47:04
So if you go this is from the member dashboard, you click that life goal worksheet and the life purpose statement. And these are the those are the three things that pop up. And it seems like it's a pretty, pretty important piece that he wants. Fairly rarely and definitely included. Because the life vision is what you wants to be displayed here. Right. And here we come across life purpose statement is actually supposed to

Unknown Speaker  47:39
be this life vision right here. So yeah, once again, some of those kinds of things that are the two different names but it was mentioned

Unknown Speaker  47:55
in the email and I think in the

Speaker 2  47:58
video as well that like that's what he wants there. So that's very important to him I feel but yeah, that's where all of that got got pulled from.

Unknown Speaker  49:02
In general, would be nice any, like we're on the right track, but this does. Look, we're putting in the right places.

Matthias Miller  49:16
Yeah, I think we're on the right track that some of the things with the with the dashboard. For example, I think we could make a life whatever that worksheet title is section under records and put local worksheet, put that under records and put some of those things you would have a contact name and year

Unknown Speaker  49:37
at this point for that and put that

Matthias Miller  49:44
under there and we can we can move it and adapt it but at least having that in the high level spec

Unknown Speaker  50:02
And then having

Matthias Miller  50:03
a record section for new investment opportunities as well. Was whatever fields we know that need to be tracked?

Unknown Speaker  50:26
You seen those are the type of record types

Matthias Miller  50:31
investment opportunities for sure.

Unknown Speaker  50:34
The worksheet probably but I'm not completely sure

Unknown Speaker  50:47
and same with the

Unknown Speaker  50:52
resource impact worksheet and think

Unknown Speaker  50:56
of that. That one, I'm not sure

Matthias Miller  50:59
about the development resource impact. How that should be modeled? It depends a little bit how

Unknown Speaker  51:05
it's used.

Matthias Miller  51:25
Yeah, another question is, does the knowledge tree ever

Unknown Speaker  51:28
change? Do we need a model the?

Matthias Miller  51:35
Is it ever more than two layers deep?

Unknown Speaker  51:39
Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  51:42
I'm not entirely sure. It kind of seems like it's like almost like

Unknown Speaker  51:48
a categorizing

Speaker 2  51:51
thing that they could that they would use. So that if they had some resource that was specifically on taxes, they could flag it with that. And then they come in here and they're like, Okay, well, this week, I want to work on some development, or, yes, some sort of development resource with investment strategies, I could come in here and see all of the resources that they flagged for that instead of having to, to scroll through all of their development resources, kind of what I've gathered,

Matthias Miller  52:28
it seems like it seems like maybe even being able to view takeaways in quotes kind of like is a good reads or something where you can view quotes by

Unknown Speaker  52:37
quotes from books

Matthias Miller  52:40
where you can see the takeaways that are tagged right.

Matthias Miller  53:04
Okay, the other the other big question. And so we mentioned investment opportunities, I think moving that over

Unknown Speaker  53:14
the comment threading

Matthias Miller  53:17
I think that's a fairly big question, how do we want to model that

Unknown Speaker  53:21
right?

Speaker 1  53:47
Maybe along with that would be the question, how do we be handled the dashboard?

Speaker 1  53:56
Are we going to suggest a with you for that? We're would we suggest they start out with the echo system for a while and then bring in a whiskey later? I guess part of the reason I asked the question now on text with the comments is that would if the user with the dashboard would be good to use for that conversation feature.

Unknown Speaker  54:39
You recall any

Matthias Miller  54:40
samples I've sent over dashboards?

Unknown Speaker  54:45
Ooh, yeah. I remember something from a long time ago, but I don't know what the project was. We're building Shadow

Matthias Miller  55:36
see what I can find here go I can show you what to turn off recording I don't want to put it on the recording but let me see what I can find

Matthias Miller  55:56
Can you Tim, can you pause recording and

Unknown Speaker  55:59
then I can share on screen

Unknown Speaker  56:09
I'm curious to know. I mean, obviously this is something

Speaker 2  56:13
we'd have to talk to the client about but based on the wireframe, they're wanting something that is much more typical web light or website

Speaker 1  56:21
looking. I'm curious to know how they

Speaker 2  56:25
would feel about a setup that isn't quite that streamlined visually. I feel like that's a question that we should probably bring up to them pretty early on unless we somehow have the capabilities to make it look a little more one sided.

Matthias Miller  56:44
So Ellis already had that conversation and I think at this point they were open to something that's

Unknown Speaker  56:49
less elegant for the sake of a lower development

Unknown Speaker  56:56
cost. Gotcha

Matthias Miller  56:57
with the possibility of perhaps in the future then we would you know

Unknown Speaker  57:03
create a really elegant front end for them right gotcha

Unknown Speaker  57:11
Yeah, just from what I was seeing from these wireframes obviously

Unknown Speaker  57:15
could just be the way they were

Speaker 2  57:18
created by us I kind of feels like they're looking or going through a more streamlined elegant look like he said I wanted to make sure that that was something that was the least conveyed to the client before we got really deep into this design process

Unknown Speaker  57:34
yeah agree.

Matthias Miller  58:20
So does that answer the I think that's that's the direction to go in the dashboard I think the next question is

Unknown Speaker  58:35
what about

Unknown Speaker  58:39
the conversation threading

Matthias Miller  58:44
they had suggested I mean, they they had actually suggested straight up conversation

Unknown Speaker  58:49
threads where you have a

Unknown Speaker  59:05
What's up

Unknown Speaker  59:13
like the investment opportunities can have questions.

Matthias Miller  59:21
Threads they had presented as being able to nest

Unknown Speaker  59:38
so a very simplistic

Matthias Miller  59:41
way to do this. Well, no, not a simplistic actually a little bit of a

Unknown Speaker  59:45
complicated way to do this. Let's run scenarios. Scenario One is you remove threading

Matthias Miller  1:00:02
and you just have an orgy of memos

Unknown Speaker  1:00:06
and you had your comments

Matthias Miller  1:00:12
saved and it gets put onto the thread and you don't have context of what you're specifically replying to

Matthias Miller  1:00:24
option two is you model this the way that it actually is you have a comment

Unknown Speaker  1:00:29
record and it can have

Matthias Miller  1:00:35
a parent or if it's related to an investment opportunity, it can link back to an investment opportunity.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:42
And then you have a report that shows you new items or that

Matthias Miller  1:00:57
shows you these threads with unread items

Unknown Speaker  1:00:59
and

Matthias Miller  1:01:03
with the reply link that creates a new detail opens a new detail screen that links back to the parent and the biggest challenge in this is probably that we need some kind of special function that allows us to custom indent threads by x depth so that we can show nesting

Unknown Speaker  1:01:23
appropriately this would be on the report or on the report report

Speaker 1  1:01:39
could it be as simple as adding certain number of spaces well I mean space

Matthias Miller  1:01:46
spaces doesn't quite do it because I mean ultimately what you want is being able to do a have a parse function that in dense

Unknown Speaker  1:02:09
in the same way that you end up on the

Matthias Miller  1:02:21
net like proposed like anytime you have a memo you can indent it

Matthias Miller  1:02:31
like to control him CTRL SHIFT M and ultimately what you want to do is be able to we don't currently have a way to

Unknown Speaker  1:02:41
indent

Unknown Speaker  1:02:48
via

Matthias Miller  1:02:48
an expression but that's ultimately what we want to do is to be able to embed memo contents

Speaker 1  1:03:03
just to clarify your RG memos there'll be a separate RG for each conversation with rows for each comment or this be an RG with with conversations where you have

Matthias Miller  1:03:19
grofers conversation in the okay in the RG idea you would have one record per conversation Well said nope we can't do that because we're going to I think I don't think we can have can or want to have one record per conversation because that's going to get us in trouble with

Speaker 1  1:03:46
having with edit collisions right

Unknown Speaker  1:04:09
everybody have ticular turn comment

Speaker 1  1:04:23
teach helps enforce a nice manners it would help to also conversation skirt and he did it would help to make sure that people eat for at least you know 15 seconds before they enter on their reply

Unknown Speaker  1:04:50
last night has a

Matthias Miller  1:04:50
very sophisticated point system. Will I say very sophisticated

Unknown Speaker  1:05:00
tangential karma

Speaker 1  1:05:09
is this what do you slash dot slash dot last dot

Matthias Miller  1:05:19
it's slash dot.org It's supposed to be I mean the name started as a bit of a joke he ACPs colon slash slash slash dot.org.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:31
Okay. Anyway

Matthias Miller  1:05:35
that's completely tangential but stackexchange has also done a lot of work on comment moderation

Unknown Speaker  1:05:52
if you want to talk about

Speaker 1  1:06:58
Stock Exchange's quite sophisticated

Unknown Speaker  1:07:28
yeah

Unknown Speaker  1:07:39
anyway

Matthias Miller  1:08:20
maybe that's about the right way to do it

Matthias Miller  1:08:32
I don't know how complicated it ends up being on the development side but

Unknown Speaker  1:08:49
doesn't sound like it's something that they're looking for specifically. But it'd be something interesting to suggest at some point. Yeah, they,

Matthias Miller  1:09:02
I mean, to be fair, it's a small group. They don't they don't need the moderation or reputation at this point.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:05
You were so good oh, go ahead. No, I guess just kind of picking up then from there with the as far as the conversation, reading and whatnot Do you have a way to get around that issue of of collisions?

Matthias Miller  1:10:35
Yeah, if they all are separate accounts

Unknown Speaker  1:10:39
then

Unknown Speaker  1:10:43
I mean some separate records.

Matthias Miller  1:10:45
So,

Unknown Speaker  1:10:45
you have a comment record

Matthias Miller  1:10:48
every comment is a record

Unknown Speaker  1:10:49
a record a comment

Matthias Miller  1:10:57
can either have a be tied to an investment opportunity

Unknown Speaker  1:11:02
or it can be a root comment

Matthias Miller  1:11:05
or it can be tied to a parent comment.

Speaker 1  1:11:11
And then you have a report that shows

Matthias Miller  1:11:26
all threads I don't know like how do you want to do this

Matthias Miller  1:11:38
report writing can becomes

Unknown Speaker  1:11:40
a little dicey, but

Unknown Speaker  1:11:46
just reverse sorts by

Speaker 1  1:11:53
you find you find the latest.

Matthias Miller  1:11:57
You can just show all threads that you have permission to see sorted by the thread that has the most recent activity on it.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:16
It'd be an auto updating reports as you can see them as they come in. Yeah, I would do it anybody would be Yeah, it would be a report.

Matthias Miller  1:12:36
Take one option would be this

Unknown Speaker  1:12:39
you would group by the thread. So maybe

Matthias Miller  1:12:51
maybe it would make more sense

Unknown Speaker  1:12:54
to have a new thread

Matthias Miller  1:13:12
but effectively, it would be reportable comments. It would be grouped by thread, and sorted so that threads would be reverse sorted based on most recent thread or most recent threads with most recent comment

Unknown Speaker  1:13:25
ID at the top.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:45
And then it would be the report itself would be editable so that they could

Matthias Miller  1:13:51
you would have a link to click reply and the reply link would open a new window that we.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:44
Do we have to be concerned about the number of records that end up being created? No.

Matthias Miller  1:14:54
Cut Cut the report off after 30 days or something

Unknown Speaker  1:15:01
They can go find old older conversations yeah

Unknown Speaker  1:15:17
yep do some indexing or something like that yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:15:26
when you index based on

Unknown Speaker  1:15:30
well if you wanted to I mean you're never going

Matthias Miller  1:15:34
to relink records so you could store you could cache the thread ID on the record

Unknown Speaker  1:15:44
and an index

Matthias Miller  1:15:45
based off of that if you wanted to

Unknown Speaker  1:15:57
Yeah, you might still

Matthias Miller  1:15:58
still have to end up using models to load it but

Matthias Miller  1:16:06
actually, you would have to do models to load it to go find all go find all IDs within the past 30 days all thread IDs and then find all conversations for those threads

Unknown Speaker  1:16:27
what is it what did you say you mentioned you do modeling what is that

Matthias Miller  1:16:34
layer? So you would have to look at you would look for all comments in the last 30 days as a pre passed for the report using a model and then when the report runs it would find all it would it would all messages within those threads and include them in the report

Unknown Speaker  1:17:03
Yeah, that sounds like a good start were you we may

Speaker 2  1:17:14
have been making some notes with that trying to keep up as best I could but they're doing so.

Speaker 1  1:19:22
thing approximately it's got a few typos slash complete things but

Speaker 1  1:20:06
Cool so then you can combine that with your notes and the new record and new report sections

Unknown Speaker  1:20:24
sounds like a good start

Unknown Speaker  1:20:44
then we ran the CCH and we we integrated with the SMS and so that the whole team chat everything can be in many based in these comments chat from the new messages from your dial pad or from the

Matthias Miller  1:21:17
Yeah, I mean you could

Unknown Speaker  1:21:28
so

Matthias Miller  1:21:40
there's no reason why this couldn't be a standalone module that we can just embed into cch and you could use this as an instant messenger with instant notifications so

Unknown Speaker  1:22:03
yeah

Speaker 1  1:22:08
cool okay. Well and what else here on the app I'm not close to finishing symbols before the the time block if we don't have any more to test here

Unknown Speaker  1:22:32
it we also would have the pepper on the calendar for tomorrow and Thursday Yeah. If you have any further input or thoughts, or Ben has further questions the proceeding

Speaker 1  1:23:00
No, I don't have anything further at this point.

Unknown Speaker  1:23:05
Still, yeah, like I said earlier, there's still stuff to

Speaker 1  1:23:09
move over from the data points and whatnot. So yeah, I'll still keep working on that later today and hopefully have most of that completed by tomorrow if we do another call for that. That's good. Then

Speaker 1  1:23:41
good anything else do we need to hit any of the more of the to do M M items in there are a few and in the Sybiz proposal puts you in

Unknown Speaker  1:24:11
I think the like the first one there to education setting.

Unknown Speaker  1:24:21
Oh yeah.

Speaker 1  1:24:31
Sure. These notification settings. Mathias this is like similar to the notification preferences on the youth file. Is that what we would use for for controlling notification settings? Or is there something else that would show that? No, we would use that for these would

Unknown Speaker  1:25:16
be really nice if there would be a way too

Matthias Miller  1:25:23
real time notifications come by email

Unknown Speaker  1:25:44
now that we have a way to do that

Unknown Speaker  1:26:06
the other way

Unknown Speaker  1:26:20
okay option one

Matthias Miller  1:26:22
ad platform support for real significations to go out by email cost relatively high likelihood of happening relatively low

Unknown Speaker  1:26:33
option to

Unknown Speaker  1:26:54
well we could do this

Matthias Miller  1:27:04
we could have alerts work off of activity history

Unknown Speaker  1:27:15
and

Unknown Speaker  1:27:25
yeah with custom with custom expressions how might we do this

Matthias Miller  1:27:45
the downside is that you can't

Unknown Speaker  1:27:47
let's do the demo alert let me try this again

Unknown Speaker  1:28:37
okay so here's how you would do it

Unknown Speaker  1:28:40
you would have your server maybe

Matthias Miller  1:28:52
custom section to the user profile.

Matthias Miller  1:29:45
Something like that. So basically what we do is we have one real time notification that works for that, that takes care of all alerts. We run all alerts off of activity history

Unknown Speaker  1:30:06
we

Matthias Miller  1:30:14
and then we can use that shared logic to both send emails and show alerts so when somebody hits the settings they could conceivably turn off all of these notifications in one fell swoop

Unknown Speaker  1:30:31
but

Matthias Miller  1:30:34
it's likely they would just drop down into the list of notifications and

Unknown Speaker  1:30:42
fix it appropriately Okay, is this what you just went over that go into a new notification section down below? It should be

Matthias Miller  1:31:02
under records the notification settings are going to be under it's under the user profile and so this could probably go into the dev spec there

Unknown Speaker  1:31:16
are the email notices? Yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:31:18
I mean User Notifications, I would consider User Notifications and email notice I mean user notification preferences and user email medicines are based are basically going to be combined and work very similarly where you can say whether you whether something should be notified by email or whether it should be a real time alert

Speaker 1  1:31:33
or both okay. Okay, so it would be maybe using the yeah

Unknown Speaker  1:32:08
then this would these should all be the same thing yeah they are okay

Unknown Speaker  1:32:41
I wonder if we could even

Unknown Speaker  1:32:57
know it's too convoluted

Unknown Speaker  1:33:25
gonna suggest that

Matthias Miller  1:33:51
I guess here's the other question on their figma

Unknown Speaker  1:34:18
he didn't really say how the

Unknown Speaker  1:34:30
settings

Unknown Speaker  1:34:45
Okay. Think something like that work okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:35:04
All right, well let's move on for for now. And pick up tomorrow they're good. All right. Stop Recording
