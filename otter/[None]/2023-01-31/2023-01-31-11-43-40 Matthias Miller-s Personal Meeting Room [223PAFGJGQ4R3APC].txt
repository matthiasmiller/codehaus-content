Unknown Speaker  00:48
All right.

Unknown Speaker  02:06
Reports in here

Unknown Speaker  02:16
all right where to start

Unknown Speaker  03:22
so if we go see the standard folder?

Unknown Speaker  04:09
Treatment ah that's even easier

Unknown Speaker  05:19
SKU amount your M SKU well your subscription plus the your price plus the ID which presumably is the lot Id

Speaker 1  05:52
got it says the same thing which is nice skew the light level

Unknown Speaker  06:07
maybe we should actually just use these

Unknown Speaker  06:15
SKUs?

Unknown Speaker  07:20
All right.

Unknown Speaker  09:23
Let's actually just kill these

Unknown Speaker  10:48
We'll get to the payroll management

Unknown Speaker  11:01
don't worry about that

Unknown Speaker  11:09
this is going to change

Unknown Speaker  11:29
trying to get a bunch of questions on okay so let's go into here

Unknown Speaker  11:42
no

Unknown Speaker  11:50
these are for you

Unknown Speaker  12:16
all right

Unknown Speaker  12:27
enough

Unknown Speaker  12:44
she's not even those.

Unknown Speaker  14:02
Think what we want

Unknown Speaker  14:34
we call these universal holidays

Unknown Speaker  16:15
record

Speaker 1  16:57
I think this we could probably just shorten it to come actually shorten this to company remove this and out then everything

Speaker 1  17:20
changes to contact record maybe I like that

Speaker 1  17:36
no I get where you're going. Nevermind. I mean I do so we would have a

Unknown Speaker  17:52
something like that

Unknown Speaker  20:34
seems to me a logical next step in this is

Speaker 1  21:07
payroll report types and

Unknown Speaker  21:25
payroll protection override Wait

Unknown Speaker  21:42
no this is

Unknown Speaker  22:30
this is this doesn't exist

Unknown Speaker  22:58
what am I missing

Unknown Speaker  23:39
we tape this is

Unknown Speaker  23:47
okay this is what this should be

Speaker 1  24:00
Did you see anything that makes you think this actually exists I have not seen anything yet think this is oops

Speaker 1  24:21
put it down there for now get it out of my way so we have August so then here we would have recurring

Unknown Speaker  24:30
we had historical somewhere Oh wait Okay, well maybe we should let's do like this configure pay period configure your company Wait, there it is.

Unknown Speaker  25:04
sure I missed that

Speaker 1  25:11
wrap around got it all right recurring historical payroll report types and users building labor tracking

Unknown Speaker  25:31
labor intensive buildings

Speaker 1  25:39
you shouldn't days break times which occasion times calculating vacation days

Unknown Speaker  25:54
break times rule production override

Unknown Speaker  26:28
needs to be

Unknown Speaker  26:41
payroll verification

Unknown Speaker  26:54
so here's one that's missing

Speaker 1  28:09
All right, so there are some tweaks to the layout, mostly reordering changing the wording to reflect detail screen

Unknown Speaker  28:21
Let's.

Unknown Speaker  29:17
Thank you

Speaker 1  30:13
It's not related when I think about it I'm just thinking about Janelle And and his conversation about

Unknown Speaker  30:28
being able to pull some of this these behaviors in

Unknown Speaker  30:45
company record

Unknown Speaker  32:10
Well

Unknown Speaker  32:25
thank you we're all of these it's

Unknown Speaker  32:35
over

Unknown Speaker  32:49
where's the labor?

Unknown Speaker  34:41
Here we should have a

Unknown Speaker  36:36
Wow that's complicated

Unknown Speaker  37:30
oops want to do that

Unknown Speaker  38:33
we should have a.

Speaker 1  39:48
We say that it will be entered as a building pool bonus amount and then we say it's going to be entered as a labor intensive building adjustment

Unknown Speaker  40:09
Let's do this

Unknown Speaker  40:52
that's it

Speaker 1  42:13
better way to do them all at the same time if we do

Unknown Speaker  42:38
385

Unknown Speaker  42:52
Knowing how to beat the system

Unknown Speaker  43:30
okay so

Unknown Speaker  44:11
this bureau report

Speaker 1  44:33
okay well I think next steps are continuing to use the snippets to spec these out I think it makes sense to I think it's fine to have payroll calculations being a separate section it's a little bit of a it's tiny in multiple places and then reports These are print outs

Speaker 1  45:21
something like that. So it'll give you what you need to keep rolling with it. Yeah, I think so I wasn't able to get a ton done towards the end of this last week with with send us stuff and whatnot but sure. Yeah, hopefully. Yeah. Flying with hopefully within the next well, even Thursday don't have a ton scheduled. So yeah, hopefully I'll be able to dive into that more. Okay. Sounds good. Appreciate it. Yep. Appreciate it too. And talk to you later. Good. Morning.
