Speaker 1  00:01
Have you? Do you want to put the poor house? Of course? Why not? So you

Unknown Speaker  00:08
actually hand it off or go to the poor

Speaker 2  00:10
house and get some, yeah, get some some, some job. Some Java.

Speaker 1  00:22
Okay, floating due dates are defined on the rental company through the contract rental company, whether they allow it or not, whether they use it or not, right,

Unknown Speaker  00:33
correct, okay, we have a company sitting for it. I thought we did.

Matthias Miller  00:40
Oh, is there setting for it?

Unknown Speaker  00:43
I thought there was random companies. Do you

Matthias Miller  00:56
need methods fixed or floating? Okay, um,

Unknown Speaker  01:04
hey, we're not talking about flowing

Unknown Speaker  01:10
Gary. Never know.

Unknown Speaker  01:16
Just came down here for two days. Should have told my sooner.

Matthias Miller  01:23
Okay, so here's the here's the good news. Okay, CRA termination. We're just extending terms. I think I told you that, right? I'm locking down CRA payments. This is my proposal. Feel pretty street holes in it gently, of course, because you're sitting between us and the poor house at the moment. But I'm proposing that we, instead of, instead of recording the cash purchase of the building as a rent payment with an equal cash price and rental amount, that we create a separate increment for a an early purchase for a CRA payout. And then the main thing is, I mean, that's really it. And then the main thing is that the handle CRA effectively, Dwayne basically got password and I got password communication issues. He did point out a little bit of a potential misunderstanding previously on my end, but we're not going to go into that the handle. CRA, effectively, we must make sure we never incur rent, such as the remaining cash price in the building. Joshua, CRA, balance.

Speaker 3  02:35
All right. Again, I was thinking about your prior comments about ignoring what, where you're wrong. But anyway,

Matthias Miller  02:47
I'll refrain. If you have 1000 if you have $1,000 in your CRA, never incur rent, such that, okay, if you have 5000 and $1,000 CRA never incur rent such that you have more than $4,000 going towards the cash

Unknown Speaker  03:05
price of

Matthias Miller  03:07
the building, right? I mean, okay, now bad debt. Maybe this is what you're thinking. I'm not sure if this is

Speaker 4  03:13
what you're thinking. Did you want to cover the EPO, no. EPO, sorry. CRA, invoice.

Speaker 1  03:25
This just is, we have a CRA payout. Okay, so you covered that Well, I guess we didn't cover what triggers it.

Unknown Speaker  03:34
Do you auto triggers it? I mean, but we

Matthias Miller  03:37
don't do you don't do an EPO. The payout will trigger it. Well, on the last if you, if you issue an invoice, when do you want to trigger that CRA payout? Do you want somebody to manually come in and say, apply the CRA? No, it

Speaker 4  03:53
needs to be automatic. But there's, there's really two trigger points. One customers paying the EPO. It means

Speaker 1  04:00
or, or there, or it's a contract payoff, right? Those, okay, so it would

Unknown Speaker  04:05
be that would the trigger the CRA payout. Note two,

Matthias Miller  04:09
the CRA payout should be automatically added if the customer does an EPO, the customer makes a payment that takes the cash price down to well, the customer makes a payment, makes a makes a payment That results in a payout of the lower priced CRA IE, they take the cash, the cash price balance of the payment down to the CRA amount. Okay, so if on a CRA contract, you're paying 36 months at a reduced. Reduced rate. If we do our math right, you'll get to the end, you'll make a payment your cash price you paid for $4,000 the cash prices building boom. We're going to go ahead and incur a CRA payout for $1,000 and pay that $1,000 on your CRA balance.

Unknown Speaker  05:17
Okay, don't you have to pay tax on it yet.

Matthias Miller  05:24
Right, right? And if, well, if the what do you do? If it's on a pay, you make them pay. Do you do that on the last

Speaker 4  05:37
you're saying if they're auto paying EPO, or the auto paying payout, or if they're paying it online themselves, those will be completely automated. That automated.

Matthias Miller  05:50
So you have to, I mean,

Speaker 4  05:52
the both that payout and EPO, that should all be automated. It's all under the hood. It's like you say, EPO. Here's the dollar value for the EPO, which is the EPO, plus the sales tax for the CRA.

Matthias Miller  06:04
So do you have to run the CRA, the EPO process on CRA, to get it to to close out.

Speaker 1  06:10
I mean, with sales tax, you kind of have to, yeah, yeah, you would okay.

Speaker 4  06:18
But I mean, in the same, in the same fashion. I think on the customer portal, the customer should be able to push a button and say, I'm doing a PPO, and it does just, just in the same way you would do that internally.

Matthias Miller  06:31
Here's what happens if they don't do that, if they don't do what? If they pay 36 months and we still have sales tax in the CRA left? Yeah.

Speaker 4  06:52
I want to say is, if they go to pay the last payment, and they specify, then

Matthias Miller  07:01
they have to pay. Do you force them to pay the whole

Matthias Miller  07:11
that basically means, on a Siri, you can't you have to do a payout. I mean, you have to do an EPO, effectively,

Speaker 4  07:18
you can't do payout. You but what about it? So unless, unless at the very, very end, at the very like, if there's one month remaining that part, we need to argue about a

Speaker 1  07:37
little bit and think through, Oh, all right, because

Speaker 4  07:40
it's at some point we need to limit the customer at the very, very end of the contract, to say you have reached the end of your contract with one month remaining in order to actually finish this contract. That here is the dollar value.

Matthias Miller  07:57
But why don't we bake that? Because nobody does that's why. Why Why don't you pick that? Why don't you make them pay a little bit more rent to the rest of the month so the monthly payments the same?

Speaker 4  08:07
Why don't you spread the sales tax over all the terms of the Yeah, you

Matthias Miller  08:11
reduce the last month's rent effectively, so that it all comes out, right? You okay, sorry, moving on. Well, this, this is

Speaker 4  08:27
probably why RTO pro said you cannot do a payoff on an RT, on a CRA contract, you can do a payout.

Matthias Miller  08:34
Probably, okay, so on bad debt, we basically had spec this out, but I'm thinking it works like a security deposit in CRA and at the point that you close a contract, we create an invoice that pays off all outstanding invoices with bad debt, with a bad debt payment. And then if you make future payments

Speaker 3  08:52
against you create an invoice that pays off, I'm sorry. Create a payment, a payment, okay?

Matthias Miller  09:00
And then any future payments you make. If we collect future payments, we would incur a bad debt row for the payment amount and put it towards bad debt. No, we're just incurred payment like seems we would yes your deposit.

Unknown Speaker  09:17
Yes, I think that's same. So

Speaker 3  09:29
the $0 you said, create a $0 payment. Is that a payment record?

Unknown Speaker  09:38
I don't know if we need a record. It's, it's not,

Speaker 3  09:46
it's $0 coming into us was not exactly a $0 payment.

Matthias Miller  09:53
Is it the net? Is you pay off? Oh, my goodness. Pay off.

Speaker 3  10:00
Otherwise your numbers never, never work out. It's a, I mean, they didn't pay $500 it's a $500 payment.

Matthias Miller  10:09
So create a payment in the payments, RG, that pays off all outstanding, yeah, standing invoices using bad debt. Wow. And then any future payments. And so as some point, any future only, you only make payments against it in the admin portal. And then at that point, if you have, you should only ever have, I mean, you could validate, could validate against outstanding invoices with a bad debt balance. And so basically, when you happen to payment portal, it's basically like, Oh, you want to make a payment towards bad debt, sure, boom. Like, how much do you want to pay? But we'll at some point have to handle it, and that can potentially be deferred. Do Okay,

Speaker 3  11:09
so there's this, so there also needs to be a bad debt fee type, presumably, yes, there's what I've been calling them, itemization types. Now I don't know if that's yeah, that makes sense. Reasonable, yeah. And then it's balance is calculated based on it's it's going to be zero, hopefully for most contracts. And then when, if someone's defaulting, then you're, you create your, I guess it's x 30 something to write off bad debt, and it says how much it is, and then, is that what it is? I think

Matthias Miller  11:49
if contract closure maybe a field change expression that adds in unsafe that says you're closing this contract, this will result in the balance of X amount being written off as bad debt. Okay, field chain expression stomps it in.

Speaker 3  12:10
So that's what it's going to end up looking like on the data model is, it's going to be a bunch of rows and the payments, RG, potentially, it depends how many, how far behind they are

Matthias Miller  12:23
likely, because I'm just trying to make sure

Speaker 3  12:27
I'm thinking about it right, but I think it makes sense three to six

Matthias Miller  12:31
months, whatever. Yeah, exactly. Okay, so then floating due dates is good to go. It's really, really simple. We just need a an adjustment macro, a floating due due, date, number days, macro that looks at partial payments made to invoice, looks at daily rate of period and adjust, does a trunk to adjust number of days. I think it's trunk.

Unknown Speaker  13:07
I mean, it's just, I think it's this simple,

Speaker 3  13:12
do we mind that? Are we still good with like, right now we're displaying your balance. How would balance do work? Then, I guess that's my main question right now, the logic is pretty simple, because we just say, we just look straight at the due date. I guess do you look at this would be the, this is the due date, then this is the due date and we need to cash that in the balances, RG, somehow right the floating due date, yeah, or not. How are you and what amount is due? Is it always and how does it work for different fees? Amount? Um,

Matthias Miller  14:03
okay, so, well, it's on the whole invoice, so it's not for different fees.

Speaker 3  14:09
Well, so you can you run a what happens when you try to say what's we have reporting right now for, like, your damage waiver balance, your late fee balance? Do we need to not do that?

Matthias Miller  14:23
No, that would still show.

Unknown Speaker  14:28
And how do we calculate it?

Matthias Miller  14:30
This is only for red, right?

Unknown Speaker  14:34
Only red gets living due dates. What else

Unknown Speaker  14:38
would get flooded due dates? Exactly,

Unknown Speaker  14:40
what happens to damage waiver and

Matthias Miller  14:42
it's due immediately. Oh, that sucks.

Matthias Miller  14:55
So you would have

Speaker 1  14:57
no wait a minute. What? All that

Speaker 4  15:02
the it still encourages a monthly invoice, and you're prorating the amounts, right? You can prorate the dwf, being prorate the rent, being prorate everything that's ever inside of that invoice.

Unknown Speaker  15:19
And so you you still just read it across the whole period,

Matthias Miller  15:27
your full invoice. Okay, so if you

Speaker 4  15:30
because at that point, at that point, it's, we have, we've incurred a monthly invoice, our periods already taken care of all of the housing of that reporting out to accounting works. It literally is due date moving at that point,

Unknown Speaker  15:45
I think you're due date. Good

Unknown Speaker  15:51
for it. I'll jump back in later if I

Matthias Miller  15:53
need it. I think what you say is that the balance of the invoice is due on the floating due date. So if you have a $300 invoice and you pay 100 bucks, 200 bucks is due on, you know, the 10th of the month, or something.

Speaker 3  16:19
But I thought it's usually that the full amount is due at the floating and you pay partial and just bumps you owe a full invoice amount at at a new date. I think, am I wrong, or are we doing it differently?

Matthias Miller  16:34
Start showing monthly. I think we have to distinguish between what's due on the invoice and what your monthly payment is. Okay.

Matthias Miller  16:57
So if somebody says, How much does it take? Basically, what you're saying is, I want to set up auto pay, or I always want to pay on the 10th of the month. If you

Speaker 3  17:14
always want to be on the 10th of the month and you're just paying the full monthly amount, no,

Matthias Miller  17:18
right? So that's, that's where monthly payment is going

Unknown Speaker  17:29
to open a contract in the test system.

Speaker 3  17:51
So all these numbers like in the rental fee section right now, we're giving you a balance due down in Yeah, they're giving you a balance due to an upcoming balance? Yeah, I can't, I don't understand how this would work.

Matthias Miller  18:07
My assumption, rightly or wrongly, is that your balance due would be the remaining, okay, that you would use the, what, you still use the waterfall method for payments, okay?

Speaker 3  18:22
Which I'm, am I thinking correctly, that that's what we store in the balances? RG, yes.

Matthias Miller  18:28
Okay, good. And so the balance due is really your, your unpaid. I mean, if you pay 10 $100 then, well, you've paid your dwf, you have some rent that you paid, you know, $96 of rent that you paid. So you have whatever I'm I'm struggling, but it shows okay.

Speaker 3  18:50
But so your your current so I normally pay on the 31st I've paid half my invoice. My new due date is the 15th. And so we're going to imbalance too. We're going to show half your monthly amount, is what you're thinking. So it would say damage waivers paid off. You probably don't have a late fee. It's probably half your rent, or a little, a little over half your rent. Okay? And then upcoming balance, we're fine with saying, is any incurred?

Unknown Speaker  19:19
Wayne, are you fine with that again?

Speaker 3  19:22
Upcoming balances, any incurred invoices.

Matthias Miller  19:26
Basically, if you're paying halfway through the month, the balance due is going to show half unpaid half, and then this is going to show the full full next month, upcoming back

Speaker 3  19:37
well, it'll that'll show the current month, plus the upcoming months, I think, is what's doing right now. I don't know if that's how we want it, but that's sure which if you don't make any Well, I think it, I don't know. Actually, I have to check it's been a little while. Should upcoming balance only be things that are not overdue? Right? I. I think right now it might be, well, I don't know,

Unknown Speaker  20:04
not sure,

Matthias Miller  20:05
however that works, but you're still not, you're not prorating. You're not doing anything different. You're just saying, You're just saying that this balance is due on the 15th of the month. What?

Speaker 3  20:20
What happens if they have, like, a redelivery fee in there that's due today? That's $100 and then you have your floating due dates at the 15th

Matthias Miller  20:30
only rental invoices can have floating due dates. The other ones would stay fixed too. Yeah. But what do we show here? Well, if they're due, then that would be included in the total

Speaker 3  20:39
other so current is current due date, the floating due date, and then the rest is just in the

Matthias Miller  20:44
rental invoices. The floating due date is the current due date. Nothing else is has floats. Nothing else floats. So if you have a real delivery fee, then that is balanced due now, full amount now,

Speaker 3  20:59
okay, but then so do we for current due date? Right now, we're displaying a current due date. That's what I'm calling rental due date. I mean, okay, okay, I'm fine with that. I don't care.

Matthias Miller  21:10
I think we have to distinguish between, I mean, we have multiple invoices. That's what people want.

Speaker 3  21:15
So, yeah, which this makes me a little cautious about the idea of rent, of calling them rental invoices. If you have due dates on there that are not rental due dates, that seems trippy.

Matthias Miller  21:30
You can have the next, we could, we could show the next due date or the No, I mean, the current due date really could be the earliest.

Speaker 3  21:42
And this is probably edge case, but I we do need to think it through.

Matthias Miller  21:47
Okay, in a typical, typically, you would show this as a statement, right? You have this invoice that was due for this amount, and you have this balance left.

Speaker 3  21:58
Do we even want this breakdown? Do we need to just completely revamp it?

Matthias Miller  22:03
Let's statement, invoice date, due date, total balance remaining. Maybe, yeah, yeah, it should be. I like that way better,

Speaker 3  22:16
because this one, this one makes sense for our old data model, but not for this, not new one, and you can make you see, go ahead, yeah, did you see the have a child screen there? Sweet. It doesn't have unbalanced history, still blank, and I don't know how we actually want to display it long term. There are, there are now rows in the rental invoices. RG, that for with report links. But this at least gives you all the raw data you could ever want. That's awesome, all the raw data you've ever

Matthias Miller  22:49
won. Okay, so if we change this to like a statement

Speaker 3  22:52
type view, are you happy? Yeah, yeah. That makes way more sense.

Matthias Miller  22:56
Every turn we're saying. That doesn't work. That doesn't work. Oh no, there's this way. That'd be a lot simpler. Let's do it.

Speaker 3  23:01
Yeah, okay. It's, well, we just keep finding things we built around our old assumptions. Yeah, and there's going to be more of it, probably

Unknown Speaker  23:09
time for new assumptions.

Speaker 3  23:15
But I, I'm very, very happy with our redesign. It's, it definitely feels like the right the right thing.

Speaker 5  23:20
Yeah. That just be like a virtual RG,

Unknown Speaker  23:42
or would you do a memo display like that? How do you make

Matthias Miller  23:49
you want to show? Ooh, I have an

Unknown Speaker  23:52
idea. Do a bottom report.

Matthias Miller  23:56
That's not the worst thing. Dwayne, what do you think about showing the invoice breakdown. Is a bottom report down here. Invoice breakdown instead of this rental fee, so you have it down

Unknown Speaker  24:08
to the bottom, and that would Declutter. It'd be easier to write. Mostly this major is it

Unknown Speaker  24:15
below your modifications or

Matthias Miller  24:17
below it? Yeah, where's it? What's the system in the on the live in the live

Speaker 3  24:24
in, it would show at a certain width at the bottom, and you might have to scroll to see the rest of the record.

Speaker 6  24:30
Well, you can, depending how tall it's a pain that's down at the bottom, yeah, that you can scroll up and

Unknown Speaker  24:35
down. I'm not sure I actually bother.

Unknown Speaker  24:37
You're saying like a

Matthias Miller  24:40
multi paint thing, like it right here. You know, I know

Speaker 4  24:43
exactly what you're talking about. I forget there's something in CMP that has it. I forget what it was. No, no, we used to have some CRM stuff that way. Yeah, we did have some

Speaker 3  24:51
CRM stuff. I don't actually love it. I'm not sure I actually want that. That was just an idea. Okay, we have three. I think they're

Matthias Miller  24:57
kind of ugly. We could use. Something like this, the memo, which I think is actually pretty The other thing we could do, the

Speaker 4  25:04
other interesting thing, the other option, is not to show it here. And we go, we continue to build out my customer dashboard concept, and that becomes part of the dashboard

Matthias Miller  25:15
well, and just build a report that we link to, if you're happy building a report link to that's the cheap solution.

Unknown Speaker  25:20
I can easily do that.

Speaker 4  25:21
I'm not. I'm not opposed to that, because you saw the dashboard I had started working on, and it's like, it's like bringing a lot of these components together all in one place, and that would be the place to expose it.

Matthias Miller  25:31
So the other cool thing that we could do then is add columns for future like you could break it. You can have an aging report. Then with the 90 plus, I

Unknown Speaker  25:39
vote for report. Okay,

Speaker 3  25:52
and see now that we have an invoices. RG, that's drop dead simple, and it wasn't earlier like imagine trying to make that with the old RG, be off. I mean, you could do it, but it'd be annoying. And now it's just like, Yeah, Of course, I can do that.

Matthias Miller  26:40
I would group by aging. I think that's really useful, because then you have totals for aging balances. Yeah. Okay, good. So we have to Dwayne and I have to talk to you about CRA stuff. Me the stuff.

Unknown Speaker  26:59
CRA stuff. I just, oh, Jonathan, they're just straight up cursed.

Matthias Miller  27:09
We're we're cheering on that phrase over here.

Speaker 7  27:12
So CRA, I have it crossed off. I don't know what you're talking about. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  27:17
Okay, good progress though.

Matthias Miller  27:20
We have

Speaker 1  27:22
CRA termination, finally, what more about CRA? Don't we? Don't we agree on that?

Matthias Miller  27:27
How the blast payment thing? I think you literally okay. The Easy out, okay, the complicated out is, go recalculate month, your monthly rent payment so that your tax balance.

Speaker 4  27:45
Oh, sorry. Version conversation, this

Matthias Miller  27:49
is the payout. CRA, payout,

Unknown Speaker  27:53
anyway, but that requires poor house coffee. That requires poor house

Matthias Miller  27:59
coffee, awesome. Let me take you back out of the CRA payments, lockdown, CRA payments, because that already, but I have to use that.

Speaker 3  28:06
Okay, yeah, I'm trying to figure out where to put my energy understood, because I need to get the whole structure stuff working. Then I also need stuff for the other guys to work on some so, so I DK, you want

Speaker 4  28:21
us to go design some things that are easier to pass off, is what you're saying.

Unknown Speaker  28:25
That'd be lovely.

Speaker 3  28:32
All right, sounds good, because we're at the point where it's a lot of it's a lot of complicated stuff, like we're wiring everything together and

Matthias Miller  28:39
well, but all the easy stuff we did earlier, like this is the hard part of the project. I mean,

Unknown Speaker  28:45
right, exactly

Unknown Speaker  28:46
by that commission, some of that stuff's going to be fairly easy for

Matthias Miller  28:49
them to probably. We might have some stuff for you,

Unknown Speaker  28:52
sweet. That's good.

Unknown Speaker  28:53
Okay, thank you. Thanks.
