Unknown Speaker  00:52
Hey, hey, hey, all Right,

Unknown Speaker  01:01
I mean,

Matthias Miller  01:04
let's see, did you have a chance to throw some kind of outline together?

Unknown Speaker  01:16
I yeah, I honestly don't know what the

Unknown Speaker  01:21
outline would be good.

Speaker 1  01:22
I I have visuals and like you can I mean other other than the outline being the three pillars.

Unknown Speaker  01:36
I think that the only productive thing I got done was, you could call this, you could, you could have your own language, tribal language for sanctuary time.

Unknown Speaker  01:57
And then I played around, here's a different view.

Speaker 1  02:15
The Martini on its own. I don't wasn't quite cutting it, but I thought maybe you could have, like an inner, an inner feeling, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  02:31
potentially, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  02:32
I think.

Speaker 1  02:35
And I thought, maybe instead of union with the truth, I the

Unknown Speaker  02:47
inner knowing your real self, collaborative strategy,

Speaker 1  03:00
even if you don't go this direction, I like thinking of so what Milton does in Paradise Lost, he has like there's a Trinity Father, Son and Holy Spirit. And the devil has his own Trinity. It's like the trinity of evil. So I don't know what those would be false, self, false.

Unknown Speaker  03:27
Dr, Paul,

Matthias Miller  03:29
well, I mean, it's, it's, it's both it's distraction and it's competitive. Or like, I know it's a double opposite, so I'm not sure how you might articulate that, right?

Speaker 1  03:51
So probably a different word. But I like, I like having a kind of contrast. I um,

Unknown Speaker  04:06
let's see, um.

Speaker 1  04:10
So one thing I thought of was, right you use your sanctuary time to sharpen your intuition and inner knowing you could say, to get clarity and around I had, I was trying to think of lines collaborative strategy. It's like, well, competition isolates you, right, right? It sets you it all competition. It's almost like what naval says is a it says what he calls the status games, right?

Unknown Speaker  04:59
Yep. Ah,

Unknown Speaker  05:12
so my thought was, you already have I

Unknown Speaker  05:39
maybe it doesn't need to be the the 100 proof you

Speaker 1  05:50
100 proof you manifesto. I was thinking maybe you could call it the i

Speaker 1  06:04
freedom, the true freedom, manifest in

Speaker 1  06:15
some sense. I think you could just take this. I and cut it down, and you already have your manifesto, your manifesto,

Matthias Miller  06:35
but I don't want to introduce another concept like true freedom. Okay, we're already struggling with two they're very similar, right?

Matthias Miller  06:57
I so. But I think the manifesto,

Speaker 1  07:15
I think honestly, this is sorry to interrupt. I think this is where you, if you do Renaissance time, you just, you just take out, you just read over your past, like I, I this is, I think this is where in this area, I think I need you to do the first i

Unknown Speaker  07:43
Yes, the first bit, first crack at it, because,

Speaker 1  07:47
and I think it could come from Your Own your own memos, your own Renaissance journals. I

Speaker 1  08:03
I mean, ultimately, this is what Megan calls, there's the technical right expertise, and there's the fundamental philosophy. And we're

Matthias Miller  08:17
after the fundamental philosophy. Yeah, so is this a rational logic or emotional logic type of Do? Do? I mean, I think the answer is somewhat Yes, but to me, is this is still very poorly formed. Is this, this is the 100 proof manifesto. Then we're starting with the concept of, we're introducing this in the concept of 100 proof, in this in the

Matthias Miller  08:55
I can pull pieces together. I feel like I'm missing a structure.

Speaker 1  09:02
Well, that's, that's what I was looking at with, with Perry's. It's not, you could call them principles or precepts, but there isn't like a core structure. It's just, hey, here, here the I

Unknown Speaker  09:25
these are the seven steps.

Speaker 1  09:35
I mean, it's kind of like Proverbs, like there's not kind of jumps around,

Unknown Speaker  09:49
even though, I mean, some of them connect with each other, but

Matthias Miller  09:54
so you're thinking a draft that doesn't involve any of these visuals. Oh, no. No,

Speaker 1  10:01
I'm happy with the visuals. I mean, I think the, this is where you had the three pillars, because that's the core. I don't know that's the that's the philosophy or framework, I should say, for now,

Speaker 1  10:29
that's, that's the 100 proof you model. I should say, I

Unknown Speaker  10:48
so if

Matthias Miller  10:59
so, I could do a manifesto on the 100 proof model and the pillars.

Speaker 1  11:17
I think this is a must have, but I realize

Unknown Speaker  11:25
I don't want, I don't want to stop any forward momentum, because this is building an asset, and that takes more time.

Matthias Miller  11:38
Well, I think, I think what I'm wrestling with, I feel like this is somewhat akin to Arlington conversation, where there's a really simple answer, but it feels to me like you're saying you have a picture in your mind of what it could be.

Matthias Miller  11:59
I mean, literally, this could be, I

Matthias Miller  12:30
this could, could be very much a two part of like the hunter proof manifesto with The three pillars and explaining what they are.

Unknown Speaker  12:40
And

Matthias Miller  12:44
then a second version, which is a bit of a sales pitch, you know, more of the sales pitch, which is, without trying to make it be a

Speaker 2  13:00
I don't

Matthias Miller  13:04
know how to create this overlay without creating yet one more overlay. But I think it's fair to say that even if you did nothing else but say, I think the basic message has to go something like this. Here are the three pillars of the 100 proof you. And if you want to stop diluting, diluting it like this is how you do it. And let me introduce myself, and let me tell you how I've obsessed over this and and the, PS, yeah, the stars kind of aligned with this, but it's, it's a it's all in. You sell the structure first, and then so myself second as fitting into the structure. Well,

Speaker 1  14:05
I have, I have a one to one. I, the way I was thinking of it was the clarity shot goes to the call, yeah, and we're just trying to, we're just trying to get engagement, small step of engagement, where they will, where they will be put in communication with you. Yeah, so clarity shot is a very obvious face to face. The other one is, to me, the manifesto. You could just start off and say, Join the 100 proof you telegram group, and then just this, this because you're reaching, you're you're reaching out to people who don't know you. So this is a very easy you. A step for them to take, so that you can start building up the group, and then maybe you can message them personally inside of telegram if you wanted.

Unknown Speaker  15:25
Those two feel like very easy asks, clarity shot or the telegram group,

Unknown Speaker  15:36
although a and I don't know if This is now. I don't know. I'm so

Matthias Miller  16:02
I'm not when I want to drop off. I want to take the rest of the day what little I have digging into this. I think it might be close. I don't think it's completely right. I think

Speaker 2  16:19
a i One of

Matthias Miller  16:30
the things I like about doing the manifesto is it gives another reason to reach out to the forum for feedback. Wow,

Unknown Speaker  16:39
that's great. Honestly, that's yeah, I was, I just assumed, like you would want,

Speaker 1  16:55
you would want to reach out and have a cold list, interact with it until you refine it and then bring it, bring it more to the people who you know, just, just because, I mean, hey, I guess the the planet Perry communities, they're okay with things not being fully formed. So maybe that's, maybe that's a good place.

Matthias Miller  17:30
Let me, let me take some time. I want to, I want to drop off, so I got some time. Let me. Let me mull on it. Let's circle it tomorrow. It's good. And one other comment I'm still thoughtful about, I don't know I'm thoughtful about fastest path attraction here,

Speaker 1  17:53
yeah, I don't think manifest is a fast past attraction.

Speaker 1  18:02
Do but I could see the client Peri community getting excited.

Speaker 1  18:13
All right, I will continue to look for a template from dev for LinkedIn.

Speaker 2  18:21
Um, click through

Unknown Speaker  18:28
a bunch of links and I'm not finding it. This is a problem when you have multiple emails and,

Matthias Miller  18:39
yep, understand, okay, let's, let's do that. Let's touch base tomorrow. Take

Unknown Speaker  18:45
care. Matthias, awesome. Thanks, Mark, bye.
