Unknown Speaker  00:00
This so that we can have a future reference.

Unknown Speaker  00:03
So and then we also have the accounting section which is the accounting and reporting

Unknown Speaker  00:10
business renewal applications which are somewhat rare, you know, like once a year process to creating new business applications and we also have the wiki where we can be adding documentation for you user documentation for you guys but you can also include any kind of documentation that you yourselves want to as well

Unknown Speaker  00:33
so I figured we just kind of start start here and kind of work our way through

Unknown Speaker  00:40
we do have an option to select a open up a specific business which will be fairly straightforward but also pull up the report of all businesses and so this is

Unknown Speaker  00:55
simply includes name contact address email phone mostly contribution and application information

Unknown Speaker  01:03
and so if we pull up

Unknown Speaker  01:07
I think this is one of them that we that we put together if you pull up the bins cabinets

Unknown Speaker  01:16
Vivian much of this stuff we had discussed but this is actually puts I guess, put some visuals to it business information

Unknown Speaker  01:27
you can you can have obviously multiple enterprise types

Unknown Speaker  01:31
contact information, primary phone additional numbers, as we discussed,

Unknown Speaker  01:38
and then postcards which will it will default

Unknown Speaker  01:47
there's a reason that wasn't filled it was because of something from the past. But the

Unknown Speaker  01:55
let's see, hang on.

Unknown Speaker  02:02
So and and then yeah, postcard the logo which can just be embedded as an image, the community message and then just a room for comments at the just free flowing comments to be associated with the business itself that it's just strictly internal.

Unknown Speaker  02:26
So that's that's businesses

Unknown Speaker  02:29
for each business, then we have we have the concept of business applications. And again, hopefully this isn't too redundant. I know there's similarities and differences between the the Access database.

Unknown Speaker  02:45
So here, for example, is

Unknown Speaker  02:49
your one of two for Ben's cabinets, all of the droplets are businesses include the include the ID number there

Unknown Speaker  03:00
well with their filing schedule,

Unknown Speaker  03:02
and again, that ID number would be the number that is coming over from access, correct? That's correct.

Unknown Speaker  03:09
Okay. I believe, and I'll make I'll make a note of some of these things to

Unknown Speaker  03:17
just to confirm, I should have had something handy to do that. But

Unknown Speaker  03:28
and I believe I forget what all we had talked about maintaining the ID for, but

Unknown Speaker  03:33
I do recall us talking about making sure that the business ideas transferred.

Unknown Speaker  03:38
Yeah, that idea is actually the most important for anonymous donors.

Unknown Speaker  03:43
Sure, right.

Unknown Speaker  03:45
Yep.

Unknown Speaker  03:49
And then when date of the application was received from the business, excuse me, the date the application was submitted to the state, the st application number,

Unknown Speaker  04:03
and then the fiscal year as calculated from the

Unknown Speaker  04:08
the submission date, and then the Now why is that fiscal year? 27? Oh, because you did six? Okay, I got it.

Unknown Speaker  04:16
It's a great date there,

Unknown Speaker  04:21
you would make that seven to instead of six?

Unknown Speaker  04:24
Correct. So we can do that right now.

Unknown Speaker  04:28
And here saying that the it was actually submitted after the final date, which

Unknown Speaker  04:36
actually is not

Unknown Speaker  04:39
is that

Unknown Speaker  04:40
that actually can happen, okay. I mean, it's more likely that it will be received after the date as well, but

Unknown Speaker  04:49
that the that the application was received after the they get their approval before the day, then they

Unknown Speaker  04:55
give it afterwards. Okay. Now, that could be a problem there now, oh, I have someone who is approved in June, they do not send me the application or the money

Unknown Speaker  05:07
until July. So that will have to be wait a minute here?

Unknown Speaker  05:15
No, this is correct.

Unknown Speaker  05:18
Okay. So but is it I mean, I think we currently worn if you so let's say that you submit it on the fourth or the fifth,

Unknown Speaker  05:27
we warn if you receive the application after it was submitted to the state,

Unknown Speaker  05:32
but in that case, I think we're good. I'll have to play with it a little bit, but I think we're good.

Unknown Speaker  05:37
Okay.

Unknown Speaker  05:40
And then we have a status that's calculated based on the

Unknown Speaker  05:45
based on the contribution logic that we that we had had discussed

Unknown Speaker  05:50
so far past the, if we're outside of the fiscal year, then and there's no contributions, then we assume they've been denied. And if they received it, they made a contribution during the fiscal year than or from from August, August or July, we assume that they've been accepted.

Unknown Speaker  06:08
Okay. Right.

Unknown Speaker  06:10
And we can actually go through the program, I'm not sure if there's anything really interesting of going through the process of setting up a

Unknown Speaker  06:20
so the business and commitment would logically be switched here. Not quite sure why they're in that order

Unknown Speaker  06:26
out. Yeah, that would make sense. Let's see,

Unknown Speaker  06:35
let me see if

Unknown Speaker  06:39
Okay, well,

Unknown Speaker  06:50
so and again, free flowing notes. And I don't think there's really that much interesting from the actual setup process. It's it's a pretty straightforward

Unknown Speaker  06:58
straightforward for Republic process. But

Unknown Speaker  07:02
the once again, the filing schedule is is based on that with the option for the year one or two based on renewals.

Unknown Speaker  07:14
Contributions then, are

Unknown Speaker  07:19
again, business the associated application which may be blank if if if you guys didn't file the paperwork,

Unknown Speaker  07:27
and not anonymous is simply based on the business itself. So over here in the business,

Unknown Speaker  07:34
this anonymous checkbox ends up controlling this checkbox as well. So that gives you a quick visual to know whether or not

Unknown Speaker  07:43
the whether it's not it's an anonymous contribution, contribution amount and date entered date received the check date check number school year, and in this in this case of let's say, let's go back to Ben's cabinetry.

Unknown Speaker  08:08
In the case of a

Unknown Speaker  08:12
shame a little confused school year here should be defaulted to the current school year.

Unknown Speaker  08:20
Okay, I'm wondering why the school year is there you have it down below with the schools. That's where we need the school. So what we've done is and I need to go back and see whether this is this is actually necessary. I think we we had a contribution we had a

Unknown Speaker  08:36
there were some situations in which I believe we wanted a base school year tied to the contribution and then we require that the schools be either that year or the following year, but I will have to,

Unknown Speaker  08:57
I'll have to check to see whether that is actually what what kind of assumptions we actually have about that.

Unknown Speaker  09:05
That makes sense.

Unknown Speaker  09:10
And regardless if I mean, if it

Unknown Speaker  09:13
ends up being necessary for technical reasons, then

Unknown Speaker  09:20
it would make sense to default it or Yeah, well, I'll check into it.

Unknown Speaker  09:24
Okay.

Unknown Speaker  09:28
And then listen, schools school year, gross amount, yep, admin fees, as we discussed, comments, and then we have and these these are also another point of somewhat disorganization,

Unknown Speaker  09:43
there's a better order or, or anything for these for these reports. We have the thank you letter.

Unknown Speaker  09:52
Let's see.

Unknown Speaker  10:03
OK, so the thank you letter,

Unknown Speaker  10:11
which looks like that schools receiving your funds about receive, etc, we've got the donation receipt,

Unknown Speaker  10:21
just pretty generic. And if there's any kind of, I mean, if there's a

Unknown Speaker  10:26
layout changes that that you would like on that, we can definitely make them

Unknown Speaker  10:31
that I'll be taking some time in the next couple days. And then I'll let you know on any of those kind of things. Instead of trying to do that today. Perfect.

Unknown Speaker  10:40
And I don't know how much you care about going through some of these but received envelope in business envelope. Those are fairly straightforward. So that's contribution outcome. Go back into contributions. Go back to the main screen here. And when you go into contributions there,

Unknown Speaker  10:57
okay, I'm seeing there. Okay. I could go to new record. That's correct. If it's not in there. And if I go to new record, that gives me a drop down of all businesses, is that correct? Correct. All active businesses?

Unknown Speaker  11:09
Yep.

Unknown Speaker  11:11
And the ones that show up first, what is in that first one? Okay. Now, you can go back again, here.

Unknown Speaker  11:19
Oh, on the the order of the contributions report. Yeah. Which what makes them listed on there is that when an application has been filed, these are in the order entered.

Unknown Speaker  11:31
And I don't think this is I mean, I'm actually really confident this isn't what you want. Okay. I think one of the questions is, do you want to filter by,

Unknown Speaker  11:42
like, here's the advantage of having a school year on the contribution like a kind of a, you know, general overall school year is that allows, it would allow us here then to group contributions based on school year, so you could only limited to the current year, and,

Unknown Speaker  11:58
and then there's

Unknown Speaker  12:02
Yeah, I think that's a that's a question in future years. Which ones do you want to see?

Unknown Speaker  12:08
And what order? Do you want them? Do you want them for example, reverse sorted by date received

Unknown Speaker  12:16
or what's what's best for you guys,

Unknown Speaker  12:20
I'm gonna say that what, okay, and this is a little bit of an uninformed response here. But I'm going to say what you have there on the new record is really what we want. I'm not sure what we'd actually use these current ones on there. Because

Unknown Speaker  12:38
when I go to a contribution, I'm looking up someone who hasn't given for a year.

Unknown Speaker  12:45
Sure. I mean, we could we could simply add a menu option for new contribution and

Unknown Speaker  12:53
renamed current one to like, I don't know, prior contributions or something like that.

Unknown Speaker  13:00
Yeah, cuz that one feels to me like, it's more I would use that when, when I'm going into research and wonder business itself,

Unknown Speaker  13:08
right?

Unknown Speaker  13:10
Yeah, I like the idea of having the the dual option there. Now, we find a short in the front page, and I'm just lengthening it,

Unknown Speaker  13:19
I mean, this, I mean it. But then even some of those things we can have, we could add another another, maybe not an advanced tab. But you know, another reporting tab, where some of those least less frequently used ones exist, or we can have a separate section.

Unknown Speaker  13:36
But I mean, really, at the end of the day, I think,

Unknown Speaker  13:40
I mean, there's a handful of ones that you'll be using frequently, frequently. And those should be very easy to find and get to right. And,

Unknown Speaker  13:51
and then some of the some of the more obscure ones, it's fine. I mean, assuming it's, it's fun with you guys, I would encourage to somewhat just avoid the noise.

Unknown Speaker  14:07
So something else that we can consider in this as well is, let me see if I can.

Unknown Speaker  14:15
So on a business. Let's see

Unknown Speaker  14:19
Susan showing up for some reason. And I'm not sure. But we should be having I mean, this on the business, it shows a list of applications

Unknown Speaker  14:31
for that.

Unknown Speaker  14:33
But if you scroll on down, doesn't it give a list of the dozen? I thought it did the last time

Unknown Speaker  14:42
the contributions

Unknown Speaker  14:49
Lucy just saying we have many Ben, Ben's cabinet tree? It was a different one.

Unknown Speaker  14:54
Oh,

Unknown Speaker  14:56
I'm,

Unknown Speaker  15:01
I think this is the one that we were on.

Unknown Speaker  15:04
Yeah, when we were on

Unknown Speaker  15:08
me see if I can find one where for some reason it's supposed to be showing. And I'll check into why it's not doing that. It's supposed to be showing the business applications down at the bottom.

Unknown Speaker  15:19
And then I mean, we could take it one step further, when you pull up a business application, an application to show you similarly have a report at the bottom that shows the contributions for that application.

Unknown Speaker  15:35
Hmm. And that would good

Unknown Speaker  15:39
Yeah, I'm wondering, he, one of the things I do is go into a business, this might be what you're talking about, and look at what they've given the last couple years. So the state calls me and says, We need a receipt for 2016. Am I understanding you correctly, that we're back on the contributors screen there that the applications had shown? Which one? Were we on business? I think, yeah. So

Unknown Speaker  16:09
we were on businesses

Unknown Speaker  16:12
right here

Unknown Speaker  16:15
on the bottom, their business application ID? Would that be all the ones that this business has ever given through us?

Unknown Speaker  16:22
Yes. Okay. That is all their contribution. It's all their applications,

Unknown Speaker  16:30
okay. And so where do contribution show up?

Unknown Speaker  16:34
Well, they they don't, right now,

Unknown Speaker  16:38
going directly from a business to their contributions doesn't exist. So we have, we would have two options. One is letting you go into the application, and then finding all contributions associated with that application. Or we could say, well, on the business, we don't really care about applications, we could show contributions down here instead, or Last of all, we can have a report section on the business that would allow you to just pull up all contributions for the business.

Unknown Speaker  17:11
Now,

Unknown Speaker  17:14
I guess I'm gonna have to do a little bit of playing on here, right off, I'm going to say on this screen, what we want is the contribution to get the contributors screen. Okay, this one here is the

Unknown Speaker  17:29
Yeah, this is a contributor screen, which we've renamed to business.

Unknown Speaker  17:37
Like, if you go back to the main page again, here. So this is a

Unknown Speaker  17:44
which green Where are we on? This is from this is coming from businesses.

Unknown Speaker  17:50
Okay. If we go to the contribution screen, there's no prior contributions there,

Unknown Speaker  17:57
see if you would go to Ben capital entry, right? No, we're not showing any I mean,

Unknown Speaker  18:05
well, there's a fourth option is that when you pull up a specific contribution, that you you show other contributions,

Unknown Speaker  18:13
I kind of like it on the business screen, that that makes more sense.

Unknown Speaker  18:18
Okay.

Unknown Speaker  18:18
What I think ideally, what I would want is on the business screen to be able to see the back contributions, and if possible, be able to click on them that would bring me to this contribution screen. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  18:35
so

Unknown Speaker  18:38
let me let me see if

Unknown Speaker  18:53
so, why, yeah, why don't we

Unknown Speaker  18:56
so we would show the contribution screen, one of the things that we could actually do,

Unknown Speaker  19:03
did you did you want any kind of,

Unknown Speaker  19:08
Oh, I don't know that we have to get into it here. Unless, unless you want to think maybe a question for you, then is, do you want just these columns that are here? Or do you want are there you know, what specific information would you want? on the on the contribution screen? And well, yeah, I think I think that's, that's basically,

Unknown Speaker  19:28
okay. That's something I will look into. And we'll get back with you on awesome.

Unknown Speaker  19:34
Otherwise, we can sit and hash hash issues here for a long time, just to see what's happening

Unknown Speaker  19:41
Exactly. And to the rest, you can be grateful, you didn't have to join Vivian for her to you, we should have kept track of how many hours of interrogation she went under, but

Unknown Speaker  19:51
I made guess

Unknown Speaker  19:56
I probably have a dressing room.

Unknown Speaker  19:58
So under schools, then this is, again, relative, pretty straightforward.

Unknown Speaker  20:06
Again, school county affiliation, this is the

Unknown Speaker  20:12
specifically added for the we Roland

Unknown Speaker  20:15
was we realized that we were wanting to track

Unknown Speaker  20:17
right

Unknown Speaker  20:18
contact info, and, and the yearly tuition notes, other comments,

Unknown Speaker  20:27
and then school applications. So you can pull up prior applications for the school. And we'll get into what that includes, we do have the family income report, which will believe should prompt for the

Unknown Speaker  20:43
Okay, it just does the current year. And if we need to prompt for a year, we can, we can change that

Unknown Speaker  20:50
print contribution update today. And then you click the checkbox and the PDF and email like that you like it good I do.

Unknown Speaker  21:00
And then the email

Unknown Speaker  21:04
we talked about whether this is sufficient, most of these emails are just straight up templates. And there's the the attachment right here that gets sent. So if there's customization

Unknown Speaker  21:16
on the email that that you need, before it gets sent, we can we can talk about that

Unknown Speaker  21:22
we we actually would like to add the feature to let you edit this in line here. And

Unknown Speaker  21:30
that'd be wonderful. It would be if if we have people asking for that, then

Unknown Speaker  21:37
that's the more votes the better so

Unknown Speaker  21:43
then that would just be set up that I would just hit the send email and that's set up I mean, we have to do that house here that would get set up with my email and just go right now. Yes.

Unknown Speaker  21:52
So it'll be from your email. And then in the test system, we've we've we have our own test email server that we use but then we'll we'll probably want to

Unknown Speaker  22:02
put in your

Unknown Speaker  22:04
your outbound email settings in the live system

Unknown Speaker  22:08
so now with this being an online system like that would okay my email is set up with through outlook Okay, well it worked through Outlook or would it go directly through

Unknown Speaker  22:23
a different source so this would go from this well

Unknown Speaker  22:30
so this would get sent to

Unknown Speaker  22:33
we would we would put in your outbound settings for Outlook for your Outlook or for your whatever your email provider is what it would not go through our outlook it would be sent directly and but depending how your email is set up it would you should still get a copy of in your sent folder Okay Are we would we would have to confirm that and if it doesn't, then probably what we'd end up doing is

Unknown Speaker  23:02
change all emails to to play in Karpen blind carbon copy yourself

Unknown Speaker  23:09
so that you can get those emails and when we get to that point, I'll probably have you talk with our tech person because things are a little bit of a mess on my end yep

Unknown Speaker  23:19
good okay one comment on this email yet well, that box remain on the email when they go out or is that just so you know what this is

Unknown Speaker  23:28
this box right here? The border here right? No, that's just a

Unknown Speaker  23:35
Yeah no, that's just to show you where the message but I thought yeah, yeah, that looks better and then you'll be able to look at the PDF then that gets generated as well school envelope etc.

Unknown Speaker  23:50
And this regression checkbox is something that is only for the test system which I think it's worth going on so you don't have to worry about that

Unknown Speaker  24:01
it's connected to our automated testing so so those are schools we have a school search

Unknown Speaker  24:08
which allows you to filter school types application status

Unknown Speaker  24:14
all that school addresses which is just all the contact information which you can on any of these reports you can hit advanced excel and it will

Unknown Speaker  24:31
pull it over here and it will give you the Excel document perfect so you can do that anywhere we also PDF as well PDF is a may be nice if you want to print it

Unknown Speaker  24:44
you in some situations you may have better luck just taking it to excel and printing it if you need to. But it's still an option

Unknown Speaker  24:53
so this addresses and then we have a school applications which currently we're just showing all applications for the school I again

Unknown Speaker  25:06
I suspect there's there's other places where just your workflows different you want to get to something a different way

Unknown Speaker  25:14
and most likely this will mean this is also available in the school from the school itself, which we looked at earlier. Actually I have it open right here so you can also get to the applications right here from the bottom of the school screen.

Unknown Speaker  25:24
Okay

Unknown Speaker  25:27
and then that is

Unknown Speaker  25:33
the school ID plus year showing the year here all for tuition, people working school type OCC qualification,

Unknown Speaker  25:45
custom income limits, with the customer base and pretty pendant salary amounts. When you receive the contract confirmation,

Unknown Speaker  25:55
the this remains Read Only if you have received confirmation and or you have made a distribution for this school year to this school. But we do let you we do kind of have a stopgap like to allow you to make changes after that event occurs.

Unknown Speaker  26:17
In which case we give a warning and let you do it.

Unknown Speaker  26:21
And that you're saying it's automatic, once a distribution is made is when it locks. That's correct. Or when you've received a confirmation. Okay. Yep, yep.

Unknown Speaker  26:32
And then business postcards.

Unknown Speaker  26:35
And this will just generate the postcards for the

Unknown Speaker  26:40
businesses as many as contributed and opted into postcards.

Unknown Speaker  26:48
See, that's cool applications. And then we have distributions.

Unknown Speaker  26:54
And here is where the magic happens.

Unknown Speaker  26:57
The work has been.

Unknown Speaker  26:58
Yep,

Unknown Speaker  27:00
far and away the most complex part of the system.

Unknown Speaker  27:07
So just to guide you through the process of setting up a new one

Unknown Speaker  27:13
will go to and Jane because we love and Jane

Unknown Speaker  27:17
we've chosen not to. And I think there may be technical reasons for that chosen not to default the year

Unknown Speaker  27:24
but open to reconsideration. Sorry, my password managers thinking it's a password

Unknown Speaker  27:33
date entered auto fills paperwork

Unknown Speaker  27:36
when you first enter it, we don't we don't populate the students but you hit the fixed students button and it populates the students in the in here. In this case, there are no remaining funds available. So well, let's abandon the band and the new distribution and let's pull up an existing distribution so we can see kind of what it looks like.

Unknown Speaker  28:03
Okay, I think all this stuff we talked through, but here it is,

Unknown Speaker  28:09
for real the we have the starting balances pre k 12, OCC, 90 ITC in the total column like we talked about

Unknown Speaker  28:17
funds to allocate defaults to the starting balance and the shows you the max discretionary amount you're allowed to distribute calculates the number of

Unknown Speaker  28:29
number of families and application fees shows you the school discretionary portion,

Unknown Speaker  28:36
which defaults to the balance.

Unknown Speaker  28:41
And and I think once again,

Unknown Speaker  28:45
the the discretionary portion, if you add, add, remove families it adjust the school discretionary portion, so that the total discretionary amount remains constant. Okay. Mm hmm.

Unknown Speaker  28:58
And tuition to allocate the remainder auto calculated and

Unknown Speaker  29:05
Okay, and now you have that calculate tuition button off to the side.

Unknown Speaker  29:09
That's correct. And that's new since we talked and so we are discussion had been this, this can can change if you like to, but our discussion had been that if if there's an award specified for any student, then we don't allocate any tuition to that which allows you to

Unknown Speaker  29:26
so let's say that we we say that Adam should get the the full

Unknown Speaker  29:32
the full amount

Unknown Speaker  29:35
and he's not eligible. But 1500 free for that, and we'll blank out the rest. And we can preview the let's see, we don't actually want it,

Unknown Speaker  29:51
we can preview the tuition

Unknown Speaker  29:56
and yes, we know that tuition amounts don't don't come right. And this will show you how it Adam, it isn't listed here. And, and it shows you the remainder of giving the remainder, how those funds would be distributed.

Unknown Speaker  30:15
Haha, okay.

Unknown Speaker  30:18
Probably not. In most situations, it's probably not that helpful. And in almost every situation, which you just want to do patiently, it's very helpful. Yes. Know that

Unknown Speaker  30:30
on calculate tuition. Right.

Unknown Speaker  30:35
And that actually, we have a problem rid of it. It got rid of Adam, we should not do that. No, no,

Unknown Speaker  30:43
that's not a good idea.

Unknown Speaker  30:44
Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  30:46
I'll check into that and fix that.

Unknown Speaker  30:52
an edge case that we didn't think to test. So the and the. And so if we actually put this back in, we should have the

Unknown Speaker  31:14
is there's clearly something

Unknown Speaker  31:17
Yeah, cuz it's calculated the whole 4100 and divided it out amongst those, or That's right.

Unknown Speaker  31:25
That's what it did. Because it didn't it didn't subtract the the existing awards, right. Yep. Yep, we'll fix up

Unknown Speaker  31:40
down there below the net all makes sense.

Unknown Speaker  31:43
So

Unknown Speaker  31:47
yeah, once again, showing the, this is from above the scholarship portion, which is the

Unknown Speaker  31:56
and in this case, we actually have a problem because,

Unknown Speaker  32:05
alright, yeah, it just got allocated incorrectly. And I need to check into that.

Unknown Speaker  32:11
But if we, if we revert to the

Unknown Speaker  32:16
prior one,

Unknown Speaker  32:19
the scholarship portion should

Unknown Speaker  32:28
wait a second. Okay, this is actually a pretty good back far enough yet not far enough.

Unknown Speaker  32:36
Well,

Unknown Speaker  32:39
now that I've as a side note, in the this is, I guess this is a great lesson on any on any of these records, you can pull up activity history, and

Unknown Speaker  32:53
it will show you

Unknown Speaker  32:55
times and dates of everything that's changed. And so here is

Unknown Speaker  33:05
so we can actually pull this open into a different tab. So this is this is like something that you could actually do in the event that something goes go sideways,

Unknown Speaker  33:17
I can actually I doesn't actually replace it, but it shows me the information shows you the information

Unknown Speaker  33:22
so that you can actually go back and, and reconstruct what we had back here. So again, not sure it's worth doing for the for the sake of this for the sake of this discussion, but

Unknown Speaker  33:38
and then we have the application fees

Unknown Speaker  33:41
ending balance, check the check number a check him out, which must match that we also validation that the school portion, what actually gets awarded is the same as tuition to allocate in different other kinds of things like that.

Unknown Speaker  33:58
Most of those are this point warnings. So if you actually write out a check, and you ignore the warnings, then

Unknown Speaker  34:05
I mean,

Unknown Speaker  34:07
yeah, problem, that's a problem. Bo, Bo, I mean, it will affect your calculations.

Unknown Speaker  34:15
So but the ending balance is, is how it will be computed in terms of

Unknown Speaker  34:22
in terms of the system. So

Unknown Speaker  34:25
it makes sense

Unknown Speaker  34:27
for print a word review form a word check letter. Again, those checkboxes are familiar word notification, family envelopes, business postcards in school envelope,

Unknown Speaker  34:39
that's the distribution

Unknown Speaker  34:41
that makes sense.

Unknown Speaker  34:44
And then

Unknown Speaker  34:48
school contribution and application summary.

Unknown Speaker  34:52
This is what allows us to do

Unknown Speaker  34:56
that goes directly to excel. Okay, it goes directly to excel and once again, okay, we don't have anybody in those categories. I think we had I saw somebody under BMA

Unknown Speaker  35:08
so in

Unknown Speaker  35:14
in any of these situations, if you would prefer to have it not go directly to to excel.

Unknown Speaker  35:22
That's completely fine.

Unknown Speaker  35:26
Some of them some of them were actually ended up being we'll get to those. And there's some that that Excel makes much more sense for when you've got multiple dimensions that you're looking at families. So we have that.

Unknown Speaker  35:45
I don't remember who were

Unknown Speaker  35:50
cheering Yeah. And we're gonna want just that new record field to be able to, we want to search for our family by just typing right? Well, we have we have this one. Well, ah, open family. Perfect. And then you start typing. Yep.

Unknown Speaker  36:04
Okay, so pull up, Walter, still Swiss. And this will show you primary first name, and last name, secondary first name, and last name,

Unknown Speaker  36:20
and phone, email address, etc. County

Unknown Speaker  36:25
Down here we have the students that you can pull up, you can create a new student from here to will immediately associate them with that family. And you just assign them a first name.

Unknown Speaker  36:42
And again, students here are

Unknown Speaker  36:45
again, like, same thing, just so now, where do I add the students for the year and put their grade so that would be under current family application will pull up the family application for that

Unknown Speaker  37:05
for the current year. And that's where you'll have the school year this information,

Unknown Speaker  37:13
the grades for each of the integrates reach the kids,

Unknown Speaker  37:17
okay, so if you can back up here now to the main screen again, if you can just walk me through this a little bit. This is one that's going to apply to everyone on the phone here. Sure. So if I have a new application coming in, what I would do is click on Open family, is that correct? That the first place I would go to to be able to search for the family?

Unknown Speaker  37:36
Yeah, I think I think so. I think I think in this is the way we have it, that's how it would make the most sense to do

Unknown Speaker  37:45
so I would go there and search for a family

Unknown Speaker  37:50
now. Well,

Unknown Speaker  37:54
let's go through this. And then let's let's Okay. And then that would bring up everything we have have at that point. So I could just go through and review that top information, correct? That's correct. And then I would just click on current family application. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  38:14
Okay. But now, if I want to add if there's more students than what is it? Can you go back one screen again, here? Sure. Okay, you just see me pointing that would help.

Unknown Speaker  38:26
Is this where I need to look and see if all the children are listed here and create a new student before I go to the current application?

Unknown Speaker  38:34
Um, well, we could also allow you to actually we allow you to create a new student from either either place, so let's say you do go through to the new student. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  38:49
so

Unknown Speaker  38:52
So let's say we add add a new student and we come back then you could you would hit the plus sign, go to Celsius bill and fill in his

Unknown Speaker  39:05
you know, whatever, however, you want to

Unknown Speaker  39:08
you want to add on that student drop down that you just did that doesn't list all the salt loses? That's just the stall so is attached to Walter correct? That's correct.

Unknown Speaker  39:18
That's correct. Yep.

Unknown Speaker  39:22
And we should make this taller? Because,

Unknown Speaker  39:25
yeah, yeah, should be room for about five or six women there. Sure.

Unknown Speaker  39:31
That makes sense.

Unknown Speaker  39:34
So and it's a little I mean, it's, it's maybe a little more confusing than, than what the access system was. Because there's, there's a stronger disconnect between the the student that was based on my recollection between the student and family,

Unknown Speaker  39:54
it does, it does represent that they are their own

Unknown Speaker  39:58
entity,

Unknown Speaker  40:02
we also have a place for you to find students,

Unknown Speaker  40:07
okay. And I mean, this is just a list of students, I really don't know how, how helpful it is you can from the student, go into the family

Unknown Speaker  40:19
and pull up the family for a student. So that there is that that cross linking there as well.

Unknown Speaker  40:27
And you could also there, I'm going to say, if we do want to look up a student we'd want to search student is we're going to have 2500 names in that list,

Unknown Speaker  40:39
right? I'm not gonna want to scroll down to that list.

Unknown Speaker  40:45
Do you want like a text search or just the droplets like you like we like we have for open family.

Unknown Speaker  40:53
Um, I think just the drop list is probably what we'd want.

Unknown Speaker  40:59
Sure

Unknown Speaker  41:06
sounds good. It's easy enough,

Unknown Speaker  41:13
okay. Accounting fiscal year summary prompts for the fiscal year defaulting to the current one shows all of this information and

Unknown Speaker  41:29
number contributions, contribution amount total schools, families and students. And then it's also broken down by SPSS, managed schools, families and students and school managed schools, families and students.

Unknown Speaker  41:43
for technical reasons. It was I mean, it's easier to be because of, again, for technical reasons, it's it's easier to

Unknown Speaker  41:53
it because the some families are freeform and some are managed here. It's easier to replicate the drill in that way.

Unknown Speaker  42:02
Okay, did we just click on that side button? And then we can Yeah, just hover over it. And you can

Unknown Speaker  42:10
this should Yeah, this will show you should show you exactly the same thing as makes sense. But it gives us what the breakdown is behind that. That's correct.

Unknown Speaker  42:21
Yeah. So that's the fiscal contribution by business is

Unknown Speaker  42:28
shows businesses with Uh huh. With each of their contribution again, for any given year, correct. That's that's based on a date, defaulting to the current current fiscal year,

Unknown Speaker  42:41
going indefinitely school detailed reports,

Unknown Speaker  42:47
and this is all Active Schools with beginning balance, donations, admin paperwork, distributions, and ending balance. And this one is based on distributions that have actually

Unknown Speaker  43:02
I believe they have been written out checks have been written out. Mm hmm.

Unknown Speaker  43:09
Yep, that makes sense.

Unknown Speaker  43:10
All right. And I just want to make a note here to myself.

Unknown Speaker  43:28
Let's see where we

Unknown Speaker  43:32
summary was the next one. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  43:33
thanks. So the Quick, quick summary report then is,

Unknown Speaker  43:39
this is what this looks like.

Unknown Speaker  43:41
It's like I sent you

Unknown Speaker  43:43
Yep. Okay, so if there's any of this commentary, that's not useful. We just, we just kind of we included it. So we can happily remove that, if that's better, but

Unknown Speaker  43:55
should be it

Unknown Speaker  43:58
should be pretty self explanatory.

Unknown Speaker  44:01
I'm along with our distribution breakdown that we had

Unknown Speaker  44:10
we discussed.

Unknown Speaker  44:24
So let's see. So the

Unknown Speaker  44:29
we have the state audit summary,

Unknown Speaker  44:32
which we've also put into report like this showing distributions total students in amounts applications,

Unknown Speaker  44:44
and then the breakdown by county with total tuition and the number of scholarships for county

Unknown Speaker  44:53
including the total its bottom

Unknown Speaker  44:56
now, is this report able to be seen in other ways. reason I'm asking that is like, okay, maybe I'm asking too soon, too. But the state auditor summary counties is something we will send to the state, the other two sections is on different parts of the form. It's not like, I just need to take that and plug it into,

Unknown Speaker  45:20
like, I want to send a copy to the state of the counties but not have the rest of the information, right.

Unknown Speaker  45:27
I mean, we could. So we've got a couple of options, we could we could give you a menu option just to pull up the counties and put it in Excel.

Unknown Speaker  45:36
I mean, we could we could completely eliminate the PDF and have three different reports for you,

Unknown Speaker  45:43
would you even do a page breaks or a page break would be we do page right,

Unknown Speaker  45:49
that that might take care of if you just do a page a break in there?

Unknown Speaker  45:52
Yep.

Unknown Speaker  45:55
And that I'm going to know more next April, when I go to see if we actually everything actually is going to balance?

Unknown Speaker  46:01
Yep, yep.

Unknown Speaker  46:06
Yeah, and any of these, I mean, again, that this is this is driven, these numbers are driven by the same thing that

Unknown Speaker  46:15
drives some of the other reports that we were looking at. And so if you want to see in a different form, it really isn't. Oh, okay. It's Yeah, it's honestly not difficult to do that. So,

Unknown Speaker  46:27
but will we can do the page break.

Unknown Speaker  46:31
Okay, accounting, fun detail is

Unknown Speaker  46:36
see

Unknown Speaker  46:39
we've got the, we got the beginning and ending balance, total contributions, list of distributions. And it's broken down by the the fund account.

Unknown Speaker  46:51
And it looks like as a side note, it looks like the

Unknown Speaker  46:58
the school calm should be why.

Unknown Speaker  47:05
So this shows total amount of the distribution and

Unknown Speaker  47:13
how much of the distribution went to this particular fund. And we'll see that there's different Hey, there, I see it. Okay. Mm hmm. Not making sense. So,

Unknown Speaker  47:23
um,

Unknown Speaker  47:26
yeah, so there's that. And then

Unknown Speaker  47:33
OCC distributions, which is

Unknown Speaker  47:41
also put wheels have

Unknown Speaker  47:42
drums on it. Perfect. Yep. Yep.

Unknown Speaker  47:47
And this is unsorted. And it should probably be sorted. actually

Unknown Speaker  47:54
know, sorting is more complex than this. This is a combination of the SPSS and managed families

Unknown Speaker  48:04
when I can, this is an XML, I can do whatever I need there by the saving it somewhere else. Yep, that's right. Okay. Now, how did you get to

Unknown Speaker  48:15
it is open both screens as you came in there,

Unknown Speaker  48:19
sir? Sorry. Um,

Unknown Speaker  48:21
if you click on the STC distribution, you go continue.

Unknown Speaker  48:25
Yep.

Unknown Speaker  48:28
And then it it downloads and open. And I had multiple Sorry, I have multiple windows open for Excel.

Unknown Speaker  48:41
Okay. So that's, that is the screen right there. That is true of them opening and I'm like, Okay, now, what happened there?

Unknown Speaker  48:47
Yeah, no,

Unknown Speaker  48:49
it's just this.

Unknown Speaker  48:52
Then the other one is the other the renewal applications, auto create applications. So copy applications from year and we hit Continue. And it will create the business applications copying amount for your to have to, etc, etc, as we discussed,

Unknown Speaker  49:10
and

Unknown Speaker  49:13
I think I don't remember exactly what what we do if you run it twice.

Unknown Speaker  49:20
I kind of think we only create missing applications. And we ignore existing ones. But I don't remember

Unknown Speaker  49:27
if that's of concern, we can check into it.

Unknown Speaker  49:31
And then print unsaid applications. So we have this is all unsaid applications, you'll have an option to print all applications which you might as well

Unknown Speaker  49:46
might as well do. So here's the here's the business application for all those.

Unknown Speaker  49:54
And then we also have the tax compliance, one that we talked about.

Unknown Speaker  49:58
Oh, okay.

Unknown Speaker  50:00
Which does not

Unknown Speaker  50:05
blank at the moment. I wonder actually, whether we have let's see, it's quite possible. We don't have any eligible.

Unknown Speaker  50:14
Let's try that

Unknown Speaker  50:18
might not have any eligible businesses.

Unknown Speaker  50:20
There we go. Ah, yeah, there. You got it. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  50:24
Yep, that's what we need there.

Unknown Speaker  50:26
Yep, and Cody's

Unknown Speaker  50:30
alright. And we are mysteriously doing multiple,

Unknown Speaker  50:36
they didn't have more than one application in there, did they actually have it? Did

Unknown Speaker  50:41
they give to contributions they would have to, they had no, no, I just have one

Unknown Speaker  50:52
check into that.

Unknown Speaker  50:56
Let's see. And so that's the print instead of applications. And the wiki is pretty straightforward. It's we've actually in the test system, we've actually used this for testing. So if you want to see all the gory details of how we test it, you, you're welcome to

Unknown Speaker  51:11
basically what the wiki is, is, you have your let me back up, you've got categories in the left. And then

Unknown Speaker  51:21
and so you might have, you know, again, this is for any documentation that we want within the system, and then create a new page, and you can, you can give it a title and, and a category and contents.

Unknown Speaker  51:34
So it's just a really simple way to

Unknown Speaker  51:38
now, you know, you know, for example, if you if

Unknown Speaker  51:42
one of the things we might end up my putting,

Unknown Speaker  51:46
sorry, my brains doing too many things at once, for example, like instructions on how to add a new user, we might, we might put some of those instructions in here. Or if there's other things that even that you guys want to document, I'm like the world more like

Unknown Speaker  52:00
a note section is what it is, it's like a note section. So

Unknown Speaker  52:04
yep.

Unknown Speaker  52:08
And that's the program, there it is.

Unknown Speaker  52:13
Okay. And what's the advanced there across the top, the advanced is, let's see, there's a couple of things.

Unknown Speaker  52:22
Yeah, contact us, we do have our support email. And so

Unknown Speaker  52:30
the the about gives version information, which isn't really going to be meaningful to you guys

Unknown Speaker  52:37
rebuild database, which you basically won't need to do command explorer few. If you do ever decide that you want to have want to connect this with you know, UFC, have a developer who wants to tie in with with this,

Unknown Speaker  52:55
then then we can, that's not really relevant, though. And scheduled tasks

Unknown Speaker  53:01
in the event that this is the kind of thing where, let's say, We want an email that gets sent out daily, or, you know, every morning at five, five o'clock in the morning, it sends out some kind of email, we could we could schedule some things like that

Unknown Speaker  53:15
imports, again, not useful for you current users might be interesting. And this just shows you who's currently using the database. And when they last when they logged in, and how recently they

Unknown Speaker  53:31
they access the page

Unknown Speaker  53:35
see current users?

Unknown Speaker  53:39
Or is it just more the

Unknown Speaker  53:42
technical side of things? Yeah, there

Unknown Speaker  53:43
are a few things that are relevant,

Unknown Speaker  53:51
we just opened them up the user administration will be you'll be using this to add additional users.

Unknown Speaker  54:00
And some of these are accessing that zone users that we need for maintenance related tasks. But

Unknown Speaker  54:09
and that's how you'll allow people to log in. And I guess if we go into these, I just put mine

Unknown Speaker  54:17
there's, there's a name and email address will have to fill in the email address is the Google account

Unknown Speaker  54:23
does not have to be a gmail but whatever Google account that they're going to use to log into the system,

Unknown Speaker  54:28
okay, you don't need to be Google based.

Unknown Speaker  54:32
Yes. And you could have I mean, you can set up

Unknown Speaker  54:36
you can, you can create an account with Google with another email address, it doesn't have to be

Unknown Speaker  54:42
but it but then you end up using that, you know, address and whatever password you assigned to Google for the Oregon

Unknown Speaker  54:50
we do have time zone here, which I think Well, I think it's already defaulted to

Unknown Speaker  54:58
to Eastern Time for new for new users. But we'll make sure it is,

Unknown Speaker  55:03
and I can't even

Unknown Speaker  55:06
can even

Unknown Speaker  55:09
Oh, this is melon. So put mountain for me. And so this allows

Unknown Speaker  55:13
time isn't really a big deal here. But it does allow

Unknown Speaker  55:19
it doesn't allow each user. So if you actually would have somebody in, say, California entering your family applications, as long as it's still the 23rd there, that's the day that that it would use. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  55:34
So it's not really that Roman. The other major thing is the app hosting zone settings. And so the Ah ha, this is where the income limits and the default school year come in. So let's say we want a new new school year, we could put in T for today. Or we could type in today's date. And we could, you know, say it's now officially why we'd want to do this, I don't know. But 2019. And then anytime we anytime we had for a school year, either based off a date field or based off of today's date, this is this is what we use to determine the corresponding square.

Unknown Speaker  56:12
Okay,

Unknown Speaker  56:15
until that wouldn't need to be set up each year. That's correct.

Unknown Speaker  56:20
That's correct. And you should notice it when you're seeing them defaulted to the to last year's school year,

Unknown Speaker  56:26
right.

Unknown Speaker  56:29
And then the the from name from email is just the outbound

Unknown Speaker  56:34
name and email address of emails going out,

Unknown Speaker  56:38
it makes sense

Unknown Speaker  56:41
and

Unknown Speaker  56:42
pretty pen that there should have comments, which is a minor thing. So that's there it is.

Unknown Speaker  56:50
Testing is also something that's only available in the test system and not so bad.

Unknown Speaker  56:53
And I figured it was something like that.

Unknown Speaker  56:55
Yep. So how do you want me to move forward here, then? So I what I would love love to have you do I mean, I think there's, there's a couple of major questions. One is can you get to, if you go through kind of a normal workflow can you get from from where you are to where you want to go?

Unknown Speaker  57:14
Or the or the pieces connected in the right order? That's question number one. And then question number two, is,

Unknown Speaker  57:21
are these are these menus, like, logically organized in a way that makes sense to you guys?

Unknown Speaker  57:28
That's question number two. I think question number three is, is really what

Unknown Speaker  57:36
I mean, we've, we've done our share of testing, we did find

Unknown Speaker  57:40
a handful of issues here. But what what would give you the full assurance that our calculations and and yeah, I think there's, there's a lot of glitches that can be, can be overlooked. But at the heart of this, it's the calculations that matter, we both know that

Unknown Speaker  57:59
and, and work What do we need to have in place, either in terms of reporting, or in terms of any kind of testing that you want to do to give you confidence that we are in a place we're in a good place with that,

Unknown Speaker  58:15
okay, here's some of what I'm thinking. I don't know if I'm leaping or stupid, or where I'm at here. But

Unknown Speaker  58:21
what I'm seeing is, if I could have Is there a way that I can get access to the program now as

Unknown Speaker  58:26
it is,

Unknown Speaker  58:28
you actually do have access to you, you have access to we have a test system in a live system, and they I think you've already access we moved. So I think you already have the URL for the live system. It's SPSS, posting that zone and and it's just an empty

Unknown Speaker  58:50
your, and I can actually send this out to everybody. There's the test system and

Unknown Speaker  58:56
there's the live system, you have access to both them

Unknown Speaker  59:03
and we used to have you mastered FTP dot org as the login email, which we can change if you want it to be something different.

Unknown Speaker  59:12
No, that's good for now. Anyhow. Okay. And this is on the test system, are you or is this on the

Unknown Speaker  59:20
you have access to both? And so you're, you're more than you're more than welcome. We have we have an account on on each one. So what you're, you're more than welcome to if you want to, if you want to play around without too much concern for consequence, you're more than welcome to do that in the test system.

Unknown Speaker  59:40
Okay.

Unknown Speaker  59:42
Okay. Then my login is just my email.

Unknown Speaker  59:46
Yeah, when you access, it'll ask you, it'll redirect you to Google. And

Unknown Speaker  59:52
then and then you'll you'll log into Google with that email or select that email account from the list of accounts.

Unknown Speaker  59:59
Because my son is if I can play around that we're meeting again on Monday, this in house here to go over things. And then I'd actually be I mean, once that's done, and we're cleared on a bunch of things there, I'd be ready to start moving towards a real program sounds good, which, which means that I need to give you all kinds of stuff to input, right? That's correct. It's that same as far as I know, the formats are the same as what I had sent you. But it's those I would just follow those same things that I sent you before. Yeah, there's five,

Unknown Speaker  1:00:38
because I have record of everything I sent you and your emails initially, because in my thought is, is if I can get the real system in there to start inputting things that we've already done in the other system,

Unknown Speaker  1:00:53
where I can actually compare the two and say, Okay, what is happening here? Are we good? Are we not? Not good? Yeah, I might do some of that, even with the test system, just to see if I enter all the families for one school and the contributions What do I end up with? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:01:14
so that's kind of the way I'm thinking forward. Does that sound like Rhonda? right spot? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:01:21
I think I think that sounds that sounds good. we're on the right track. And I mean, the, I think, I think on this end, we are pretty committed to making this work. And

Unknown Speaker  1:01:34
this will turn this around into a plus that we have, we have, we have 24 seven developer resources,

Unknown Speaker  1:01:47
which we can't, it's not in Colorado, it is in Bangladesh.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:53
So there's literally Yeah, anyway, this is because of Islamic weekend, like, like Islamic weekends and stuff, there's, there's, I think, literally a timezone difference literally, like, a 12 hour window, when there's when there's no kind of bizarre but

Unknown Speaker  1:02:11
all that to say, we're really committed to making this work. And, and in the case of making a change or effects or something like that,

Unknown Speaker  1:02:20
you know, there, there's, we're, I think we're pretty committed to, to being really to being responsive with those. And so

Unknown Speaker  1:02:30
now, the one question I do have is, how,

Unknown Speaker  1:02:37
what problem is it if I don't find an issue on the testing until after it's actually we're working on our program? How much more of a problem is it to fix something if I find it there versus finding a here on the test? So I mean,

Unknown Speaker  1:02:55
it the answer that we all love is, it depends, right? Most likely, though, it's the actual, the actual,

Unknown Speaker  1:03:06
where I would expect to be the most the two places I expect problems to be the most likely are one, there's some kind of glitch in in the interface or, like, there were some kind of validation that needs to be loosened up or needs to be changed, or, or something like that, or there's a calculation error. And

Unknown Speaker  1:03:25
in the case of just one of those glitches, it's it's non consequential in the case of a calculation error, I think most more than likely, the, the information that's stored is correct. And,

Unknown Speaker  1:03:45
and actually, I just had an idea here,

Unknown Speaker  1:03:49
hang on a second, the,

Unknown Speaker  1:04:02
in the case of a calculation error, that the information that's actually stored in the database is correct. It's just that we're, you know, we're

Unknown Speaker  1:04:11
whatever, for some reason, we're not including something we should we should be, or

Unknown Speaker  1:04:16
whatever it is. So

Unknown Speaker  1:04:20
I actually do have an idea to to even limit the potential scope of an impact further, quite frankly. So that's, that's a really long way of saying I don't anticipate there being things that are just horrific in terms of are really much of an issue in terms of impact on existing stuff. Okay. You know, the probably the worst thing Well, I guess another example would be the most embarrassing kinds of mistakes are sending out some some inaccurate information,

Unknown Speaker  1:04:59
like any of the reports we generate. Yeah, emails that are inaccurate or reports that we send out that are inaccurate.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:09
Okay, well, that gives me some, some good input and I will do some pretty significant work here in the next couple days. And then get back with you. Alright, sounds good. And as always, holler if you need anything. Okay, I'll do that. Thank you. Besides, all right, you bet. Thanks. Bye bye.
