Hey Ben, so that I do an honor this time because I'm on the way home and I want to get this out of my head before I do. There are a few things that I would like if you could chase on my behalf. Number one, what is the proper support contact for code house clients specifically for new horizons and echo. And once you've got that, then we need to notify the folks over at Echo about what the best way is that everybody has visibility into what's going on. Number two, we had a client down situation with them because it's not really our fault because we said they're responsible for backups and making sure everything's happening. So it is what it is, but cleaned down because they apparently had an antivirus running and sweep swept up the database files. We usually tell corporate clients and investor tools not to do this. So there I think a few things that we should do number one, I think we could take a look at Investor tools documentation on on best practices with antivirus and then integrate that into some kind of wiki documentation for self hosted systems. There are some there is some documentation regarding self hosted systems. And then we should send an email to Leslie at New Horizons, letting him know to do this and basically you know it's on your own blood is on your own hands if things go sideways with this we can't control that. So mostly want to get this over my head over into your court. And let me know if you need any more info.
