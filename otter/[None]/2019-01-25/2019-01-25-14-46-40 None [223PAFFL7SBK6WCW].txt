Speaker 1  00:01
Okay, so so I'll just recap a little bit. So the first approach would be to do the winning together book to event planners free book for Colorado Springs event planners and be along the lines of

Speaker 1  00:17
you know it's along the lines in this digital age one of the one of the things that event planners realize that most people don't is that we're driven by human connection and

Speaker 1  00:30
and and while we focus on well as event planners we focused on creating that for other people we sometimes forget to take the time to do that for this for ourselves and you know this book is really about

Speaker 1  00:47
you know it's about helping you as an event planner to

Unknown Speaker  00:52
to

Speaker 1  00:54
not only create human connection but also to use that in a in a way to build powerful relationships they can they can build and grow your business in

Speaker 1  01:10
and be yeah because we want to well yeah

Speaker 1  01:16
because we want to encourage we want a movement of people who

Unknown Speaker  01:23
seek out and create human connection and we're

Speaker 1  01:28
and we see you as somebody who already does this and we want to give you a copy

Unknown Speaker  01:34
you just pay shipping and handling?

Unknown Speaker  01:44
No, I think I think it's a good idea

Speaker 1  01:46
to to reach out in that focused way. I guess the big question that I'm wondering like thinking about the stage of our business right network, a place

Unknown Speaker  01:59
where

Speaker 1  02:02
we need we need to turn profits fairly quick to keep the cash flow.

Unknown Speaker  02:10
And there's

Unknown Speaker  02:13
correct me if I'm wrong, but there's different

Speaker 1  02:17
different types of leads. There's your ground, you're breaking new ground trying to find new leads and new new ground and then there's

Speaker 1  02:28
building on current connections. And I'm wondering if right now where we're at if we need to be focusing on building on our current connections that we have.

Speaker 1  02:42
And the reason I say that is because it's expensive and time consuming to reach out to people you don't know.

Speaker 1  02:52
But are there ways that we can find prospects among people we've already connected with in the past or that you've already built? Good report with?

Unknown Speaker  03:11
I'm just throwing that out as a question.

Unknown Speaker  03:14
Well,

Unknown Speaker  03:17
which is, which is more Well,

Unknown Speaker  03:21
yes. And no, I think

Unknown Speaker  03:29
there is this one that

Unknown Speaker  03:35
so that may be more of an argument for

Speaker 1  03:39
Well, yeah, I don't know. I I'm honestly a little divided on that. On one hand, yes, I completely get what you're saying.

Unknown Speaker  03:49
On the other hand,

Speaker 1  03:57
here we go. Um, the on the other hand,

Speaker 1  04:03
there's a lot of pressure that comes off of us when we have a system in place that generates leads. And so I can't tell you, you know, I can't tell you. I don't know if I even knew for sure. When's too soon, or weds too early. You know, hello, we should wait. But I know that just this idea here that that we've got three delegation booklets that are going out to people is a sense of relief to me, because I know there's something that's happening when I'm not making the wheels turn.

Unknown Speaker  04:38
So what if we would, yeah.

Speaker 1  04:43
Now, the other thing is, you know, on the nonprofit side, you could do something like

Unknown Speaker  04:51
how nonprofit

Unknown Speaker  04:57
how, how nonprofit

Unknown Speaker  05:05
how nonprofit executives can regain

Unknown Speaker  05:09
10 hours or more per week, or whatever it is, you know,

Speaker 1  05:14
there, it's a little bit of a, that me Actually, it's a more direct approach. It does mean I think putting together some slightly different collateral for them.

Speaker 1  05:30
And they're the pain point is, look, I'm so busy, I don't even have to have time to delegate. So the question is, how do you get them to the point where they actually have capacity where they can delegate? Yeah,

Speaker 1  05:57
so if we go through existing connections, I guess what's what what approach?

Unknown Speaker  06:05
What angle?

Unknown Speaker  06:08
Do you see us taking

Unknown Speaker  06:11
a good question

Speaker 1  06:17
and see within our connections, I guess we all have to look at who

Unknown Speaker  06:25
agree, you know,

Unknown Speaker  06:28
which are connections that

Unknown Speaker  06:32
could make the decision

Unknown Speaker  06:35
could make it a decision that would lead towards

Speaker 1  06:43
a deal closing out an offer? And is this say what, what is the segment that like, what's the demographic? Not the demographic the target market that we're aiming towards? And the Are there any leaders within that target market within our

Speaker 1  07:03
connections, already established connections that we want to reach out to? Like,

Speaker 1  07:09
for example, if we're wanting to target nonprofit leaders, look at your contacts. Is there anyone in your contacts? That's a nonprofit leader?

Speaker 1  07:19
Or is there anyone within your context that knows a nonprofit leader that could give us referral for wanting to reach out to health healthcare industry? Okay, is there anyone within my with in your current connections that knows someone in a leadership position in the healthcare industry? Yeah, we're looking for feet in the door, so to speak. Yeah.

Speaker 1  07:42
Or another way to say it, you would be on who knows somebody, but who knows? Who knows? Multiple, like Frank for going into that, but who knows? Multiple, for example, Frank would be a great person. Yeah. Nonprofit realm. Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1  08:01
And I guess so when you go through relationships, you You're, you're not having to prove to them why you're there. number one choice among the crowd, you already have an advantage. And of course, you have to prove yourself still, but you you already have the foot in the door, whereas

Speaker 1  08:26
with perfect strangers, you're having to try to prove to them why you're the one to even allow their foot in the door.

Speaker 1  08:45
I guess I guess the thing that I'm that I'm kind of processing right now is how can we

Speaker 1  08:51
like what's the shortest way that we can get to at least one or two people that we can close on a deal soon? And what really got me thinking about that, is that Facebook posts he shared with me and he talked about focusing on one like, get one and is there Do we need to shift away from

Speaker 1  09:17
the idea of let's let's try to get as many leads. Let's try to get leads and make it senior. Let's try to get a lead or a deal. Like,

Speaker 1  09:31
let's try to get as quickly as possible to someone

Speaker 1  09:35
who has a problem that we can solve, instead of trying to focus so much on what's our industry, but

Speaker 1  09:45
who's someone close that we can get to quick and close quick? I don't know, I'm just kind of throwing it out there thinking about the situation we're in where we we need cash flow sooner rather than later. I don't know.

Speaker 1  10:06
So it's still the criteria of how do we get to somebody quick

Speaker 1  10:11
is unclear criteria. Mm hmm. So are we looking for

Speaker 1  10:29
I don't even know if we, I mean, have you clearly defined what kind of person that is from from my network?

Unknown Speaker  10:35
From your perspective?

Speaker 1  10:38
What are from what you've seen? And maybe So, you know, this is maybe the question you should be asking me instead of me asking you but what what are the characteristics of the person that we should be?

Unknown Speaker  10:51
I didn't learn

Speaker 1  10:59
Yeah, what I'll ask you, what are the characteristics we should be looking for?

Unknown Speaker  11:08
But then your network people that you know, or

Unknown Speaker  11:12
go

Speaker 1  11:28
What? Okay, so first of all, they have to have a big enough problem. So I think they have to be the point of

Speaker 1  11:36
money. I still think seven figure mark is probably close to what we're looking at. I mean, maybe there's something you want before that but

Unknown Speaker  11:46
I think you almost have to be at that point.

Speaker 1  11:50
So how many how many people do I know who own seven figure owner managed seven figure companies

Unknown Speaker  12:00
there's

Speaker 1  12:12
another potential characteristic is Who are the people who are just stuck in busy

Speaker 1  12:19
parents are busy for the wrong reasons, but they might be busy for the right reasons.

Unknown Speaker  12:36
I mean, I guess I'm kind of

Speaker 1  12:56
So another question while we're thinking about this, what is it that we're going to offer them? Are we wanting document the nuclear reactor live? Are we wanting to offer offer them

Unknown Speaker  13:08
yeah, yeah. What would we what are we wanting to offer?

Speaker 1  13:11
Well, yeah, I think I think that's a fair question as well so I mean if we're actually to want to want to do the new nuclear reactor lab

Unknown Speaker  13:21
I think I think one of the things we could do

Unknown Speaker  13:25
is call up some of the recipients

Unknown Speaker  13:29
again I don't know if we need to get a

Speaker 1  13:36
no sir is a whole other set of questions

Speaker 1  13:40
does that qualifies does that fall into the the telemarketing at that point

Unknown Speaker  13:47
call our best with me feedback

Unknown Speaker  13:51
on the packet that we sent

Unknown Speaker  13:56
Do we need to tell marketing licenses that what you said

Unknown Speaker  13:59
yeah that's that's my question I'm not sure what the laws are in that

Unknown Speaker  14:07
and do we need to check the Do Not Call and all that kind of stuff

Unknown Speaker  14:16
so I have no idea

Unknown Speaker  14:35
what do you so

Speaker 1  14:38
what do you think about try it so with the nuclear reactor lab What if we see it as our goal to get five lined up before or have a set number that we want to have X amount of nuclear reactor labs

Speaker 1  14:56
scheduled by such and such date and just buckle down and see that as our that's our the measure right now get X amount of nuclear reactor labs setup mind up and just focus on that and what why

Unknown Speaker  15:15
not why X number why not one

Unknown Speaker  15:20
that's that's a good point to get one

Unknown Speaker  15:25
see that

Speaker 1  15:25
okay so so that's kind of I mean that's that's it that's a completely different ask then I don't know why like why is it so challenging it feels like the markets bigger for that and for me for me to message some of my friends or email them and be like hey like we're putting together this new team building offer

Speaker 1  15:48
and looking for people who might benefit from it would you be open to Chris and you a copy like a page article article that you can read that the chairs with what it's about and consider if you know if there's anybody in your network who would benefit from this

Speaker 1  16:07
that's a lot easier than saying hey look we're looking for somebody wants to build a 20 to $50,000 custom software solution Yeah Do you know anyone in your back pocket like a

Unknown Speaker  16:21
yeah

Speaker 1  16:24
I mean forking out three to 5000 to fill up your team instead of 20 to 50 to streamline your infrastructure for some reason makes

Unknown Speaker  16:37
seems

Unknown Speaker  16:38
like a quicker feel fulfilled leader

Speaker 1  16:41
yeah I think to not even quite sure how some of these are going to go I wonder too sometimes if we'd have more luck with like a $5,000 stock package that gets your foot in the door

Speaker 1  16:54
a software package $5,000 and then allows us to customize it from there

Speaker 1  17:00
like oh you guys can actually do x y&z but I don't I don't really know number

Unknown Speaker  17:11
yeah

Unknown Speaker  17:19
I don't know it's just something I'm throwing out. But

Unknown Speaker  17:21
I

Unknown Speaker  17:23
maybe it's something

Speaker 1  17:25
you you want to sit on over this next week that I'm out of the office. And when I get back we can focus on

Speaker 1  17:36
Yeah, something like have a clear lead manager and we're aiming towards it.

Unknown Speaker  17:42
Yes,

Speaker 1  17:44
I think this is probably just a part of being an entrepreneur and being a startup company. But it kind of feels like we're still just let's try this. Let's try that. Let's try the other and none of them have a beer win or lose money measure. It's just let's let's do a

Speaker 1  18:05
LinkedIn article will do Facebook Mark ads. And all of these I think are need needed to keep

Speaker 1  18:15
getting out there feelers out there is there some clear defined lead magnet that we can focus on? Like this is what we're pouring ourselves into? And we're going to work for that

Unknown Speaker  18:28
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1  18:31
But the main thing that needs to happen if we need to identify a lead manager is clearly elite like this is leaving ports are lag

Speaker 1  18:41
and not just come up with any randomly manager.

Unknown Speaker  18:47
Right,

Speaker 1  18:48
right. Something else that I'm wondering is how can we so Heidi like we put a lot of work into getting their sales letters out there, you talked about phone calls, but is there any way that we can

Speaker 1  19:01
instead of just oh, we didn't hear back but somehow

Unknown Speaker  19:06
have follow up effort

Unknown Speaker  19:09
to make sure we did our best on that. Yeah,

Speaker 1  19:15
oh, sort of an experiment sending them out but yet at the same time,

Speaker 1  19:20
I don't know is there something that needs to happen to to

Unknown Speaker  19:27
maximize that effort?

Unknown Speaker  19:48
fair question

Speaker 1  19:54
well here's an idea I don't know if I like it or not but I feel like it or not

Unknown Speaker  20:00
take a day

Unknown Speaker  20:02
give me a route

Unknown Speaker  20:03
Toby world we mailed them

Speaker 1  20:04
and I did my day just dropping in and would be awesome is like, I don't know like,

Speaker 1  20:12
I don't know what I have Starbucks drink early. You know, I don't know what to something,

Speaker 1  20:18
something to drop off like a little little gift and say, Hey, I told you guys this copy this particular series to get any feedback on it or anything like that. Yeah,

Speaker 1  20:37
you can even frame it as

Speaker 1  20:42
I'm really interested in your feedback on it, because I wanted to develop it to be as relevant as possible. You have any thoughts to share with me? Yeah,

Speaker 1  20:54
so you're not necessarily showing up to say, hey, I'd like to,

Speaker 1  21:00
I'd like you to become my client. But that's sort of in the back of our mind.

Speaker 1  21:06
Well, I think so already Gelber has his philosophy is point of selling is to get to the truth about the sale.

Speaker 1  21:16
And so and I think that's what people ask him, why are you trying to sell me his responses know, like, I don't even know whether or not you're a good fit.

Speaker 1  21:27
My point is not to sell you. My point is to to figure out whether or not this is a good fit. And so, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  21:37
anyway,

Unknown Speaker  21:39
that's, that's a good approach, I think, know,

Unknown Speaker  21:44
that's what sales should be. But it's not always.

Speaker 1  21:50
And as a side note, a lot of objections come from when there's information that's withheld or a lack of understanding on salesperson's part,

Speaker 1  22:03
like people often complain about money when the reality is it's it's not a good time for them, or they don't trust the person or they don't think it's actually not the right solution for them, or whatever. Like, they'll just pick a random excuse.

Speaker 1  22:17
So anyway, it's it's much better to facilitate transparency than it is anything else? Oh, yeah.

Speaker 1  22:38
So that was in the in the child care market and the quiet we did a lot of discussing sense that mailing evolved and wondering Is that where we want to invest your hands on time? Or do we want to,

Speaker 1  23:00
I guess, a geek in my mind that each time we want to target but that that circles around to where are the needs and then that circles around to well know what the needs are going to

Speaker 1  23:14
engage the potential audiences I don't know how

Speaker 1  23:19
to Day of that we give me a lot of we probably give me some insight if I can ask them a few questions. You know, what's what's, what's the big challenge early access person, front desk or whatever? Yeah, yeah,

Speaker 1  23:36
I see there being a lot of value in you getting out and talking to people.

Speaker 1  23:50
As a side note, I don't know if I ever told you this back when I was I was doing kind of

Speaker 1  23:57
looking into doing AdWords for different types of people I pursued some roofing companies and stuff

Speaker 1  24:04
and I don't know if this is just because roofing Is it hot enough market or what? But actually have actually had one guy that I approached on it was doing cold calls like business to business. And I actually had one guy offered me a sales job.

Speaker 1  24:19
He was like, Hey, if you're looking to sell ropes, like

Unknown Speaker  24:25
can work for me.

Unknown Speaker  24:26
So

Unknown Speaker  24:29
Wow. So

Unknown Speaker  24:32
you're a salesman? Yeah. So yeah.

Speaker 1  24:34
Anyway, so it's kind of interesting anecdote. But I mean, besides the challenge of of being able to reach people,

Speaker 1  24:44
that's kind of that can be part of the challenge when you're just dropping by

Unknown Speaker  24:50
the but then if there are

Unknown Speaker  24:55
other other people there who are able to answer those questions, then. Yeah,

Speaker 1  25:02
where were you feel you'd be investing your time better? Do we want to have multiple days like one day, you get to as many addresses as possible within the child care market another day, all the non to as many nonprofits as possible to another day, another day to as many

Unknown Speaker  25:23
want to see everyone elder care market?

Unknown Speaker  25:31
Oh,

Speaker 1  25:32
let me summarize. You share you, we think about what you found and try to hone in on which one we want to focus on.

Unknown Speaker  25:59
I'm not sure which is best.

Unknown Speaker  26:10
I don't know if there is a best

Unknown Speaker  26:14
or I don't know that we know best.

Unknown Speaker  26:18
I think it's a

Unknown Speaker  26:20
well, let's do it. And

Unknown Speaker  26:28
now let's see what yeah, let's see where it goes.

Unknown Speaker  26:31
Sure.

Speaker 1  26:33
So just just to clarify, when you think about

Unknown Speaker  26:39
getting out and seeing what the needs are,

Unknown Speaker  26:42
are you thinking

Speaker 1  26:45
regards to leadership and delegation or regards to software knee? Or just any, like identifying what's their biggest pain point? What are we looking for?

Speaker 1  27:02
I think it makes more sense to Well, I mean, fair question, I don't think it's softer at this point. I think that's that's,

Unknown Speaker  27:13
I don't know,

Unknown Speaker  27:18
that's like a long shot.

Speaker 1  27:24
Now, if we so i think i think the nuclear reactor lab is, is maybe easier because there we have something tangible that we're that we're looking to,

Speaker 1  27:44
to offer. I really like the idea of offering them something having something very specific and tangible to offer. And

Unknown Speaker  27:56
it feels like that

Unknown Speaker  28:00
manageable investment as

Unknown Speaker  28:02
well, even for six figure companies. Yeah,

Speaker 1  28:07
maybe you're not wanting to get into six figure companies anyway, that's

Unknown Speaker  28:12
make sense problem with it. As long as they

Unknown Speaker  28:16
mean

Speaker 1  28:20
the same 60, your company can grow into seven figures. So my only opportunity

Speaker 1  28:26
and if they're a good claim at six figures are going to be a good claim that seven figures, I think that's, that's Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 1  28:35
Was it going with that? Okay, there's still this other thing, this other thoughts that I had, I don't know if this is the right thing, but the employee engagement index or something along those lines that I talked about that.

Unknown Speaker  28:54
So this is kind of the intrigue idea,

Unknown Speaker  28:58
but

Speaker 1  29:02
Robert Lee was talking about, about the intrigue, and so, you know, we could do something along the lines of employee engagement index, where we, you know, we come in, and we, we help we help them define and measure

Speaker 1  29:15
their, their employee, you know, productivity and engagement.

Speaker 1  29:20
And it's really just the New Horizons 360 concept

Speaker 1  29:26
that, you know, I don't know, maybe we use software, but maybe for the first first few, we just manually offer it,

Unknown Speaker  29:38
and

Unknown Speaker  29:40
maybe it's free, maybe it's 50 bucks.

Unknown Speaker  29:45
I don't really know what it is. Yeah, I like that.

Speaker 1  29:52
So in other words, is a survey that you would

Unknown Speaker  29:59
fill out?

Unknown Speaker  30:00
Well, it's a survey that we would actually I think we would actually facilitate.

Unknown Speaker  30:04
Okay, yeah,

Speaker 1  30:04
so we would meet with all the individuals, it only takes like, two or three minutes, I mean, maybe five minutes per person. So if for manager, it's like more, maybe more, like 1010 or 15 minutes. So if this person were to leave, how would you feel about it,

Unknown Speaker  30:21
and we can borrow New Horizons questions for that.

Speaker 1  30:27
And then you just do that you use the same scoring model that we use for new horizons, and we say, hey, look, here's your employee index.

Speaker 1  30:35
And we see some opportunity here, some opportunities that we see, if we, if we were to ask them open ended questions, we could actually get real feedback from people as far as what they what they see to, to improve the, you know, the,

Speaker 1  30:49
the work environment, I could actually,

Unknown Speaker  30:56
if we want guinea pigs,

Speaker 1  31:00
I bet software builders or investor tools would pay my time, if I could pitch the managers on it.

Speaker 1  31:11
I don't know I could float the idea with with like, the customer service, one of the customer service managers and,

Unknown Speaker  31:20
and like one of the dev teams,

Speaker 1  31:24
Josh wouldn't be too keen on it. But one of the other dev teams to do it with his team

Speaker 1  31:31
that could become, you know, whether or not they want their name attached to it

Unknown Speaker  31:37
would be ideal. They would

Unknown Speaker  31:43
get at least at least give us feedback. And or

Unknown Speaker  31:48
Yeah, yeah, I like that.

Unknown Speaker  31:51
And then

Unknown Speaker  31:54
if we can get at least

Speaker 1  31:56
one even house, maybe software builders, but even one other, and perhaps even Stan Yoder, get him close on that and just give it a go see how it goes. Yep. And then you'll be ready to go. Then you'll have new ideas or ways to develop it for the next one.

Unknown Speaker  32:18
Yep.

Unknown Speaker  32:20
Yep. I like it.

Unknown Speaker  32:23
I like it a lot.

Speaker 1  32:27
Okay, well, can we put on on this for the next meeting top or revisit

Unknown Speaker  32:33
moving nuclear reactor lap forward?

Unknown Speaker  32:49
Oh,

Unknown Speaker  32:53
oh.

Unknown Speaker  33:15
Oh, sorry. Yeah, go ahead.

Speaker 1  33:20
Our team meeting I ripped out barcode project there any way or anything that needs to happen to get this in place. So we can move forward with this after any step z. And he is done? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  33:36
there are things that we could do.

Speaker 1  33:41
It's like, it's it's maybe if I mean, it's, it's their budgets up to 1500. So kind of what I would be inclined to do is bit at at 1250 or something, and

Speaker 1  33:56
I don't know, maybe it's less than that. Maybe it's more than that. But it's a shot.

Speaker 1  34:03
So you think you get a project done in 10 hours or less? Yeah,

Speaker 1  34:14
depends on who the specs are. But yeah, probably it's a fairly it's a relatively small project.

Speaker 1  34:20
Okay. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 1  34:28
Is that something you feel is worth pursuing? Or is it something you want to just kind of wait and see what happens?

Speaker 1  34:35
No, I think it's worth pursuing I think it's I'm really interested in the deeper we can entrenched them the better.

Unknown Speaker  34:42
I mean, that's

Unknown Speaker  34:45
Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1  34:50
Are there pieces you want to start any groundwork you want to start doing so that when you're done with any champ development, you can move on to that, but any emails that need sent out or anything you need me to do to help get it to the place where

Unknown Speaker  35:04
it's ready to jump on?

Speaker 1  35:11
