Unknown Speaker  00:54
Ben can with us

Unknown Speaker  01:15
good day Good day

Unknown Speaker  01:46
Nick nice

Unknown Speaker  01:54
All right on screen

Unknown Speaker  01:57
sharing and

Speaker 1  02:10
so first part we've got an icon for here has to do with the faith builders merge two systems and just waiting to connect about that I was had mentioned something about NASA

Unknown Speaker  02:32
so I think the main idea and if

Speaker 1  02:37
you can, you know the context of it more basically just filling us in on what your plans are for

Speaker 2  02:45
the merge kind of level where where things are at yeah

Unknown Speaker  03:01
head back into the project.

Unknown Speaker  03:03
Um

Unknown Speaker  03:11
so,

Speaker 3  03:12
I went through the living spec for zfp, and more or less flesh that out

Unknown Speaker  03:23
so, at this point, there's

Unknown Speaker  03:23
still

Speaker 3  03:26
well, okay, I'm planning to talk with a client while we're there at FB this upcoming weekend, slash beginning of next week, and hopefully get a little more clarity on how to work to handle the overlap between ei T, C, and SP, schools and businesses. Now that we've been combined in one system, that was one of the, I mean, aside from just the simple designing of exports, export import pairs, that's one of the major things that's left to consider. Because currently, there are some businesses, I think that are in both systems operating as UI etc. And as SP and there are also contexts

Speaker 3  04:24
that are related to the one system and all the other. Anyway, um, so yeah, still needed to do the actual specking for exports and imports. And consider what we'll be adding a section to the Contact records for businesses.

Unknown Speaker  04:44
Custom section, so that's one piece of it.

Unknown Speaker  04:51
Is that are they using the,

Speaker 2  04:54
the old or the new contacts XRP I'd like to check here to

Speaker 1  05:08
wondering if that is gonna be something I want to do is update them to the new context.

Unknown Speaker  05:15
Now that's what they're all new got the new ones? Yeah, sure.

Unknown Speaker  05:33
Cool.

Speaker 1  05:37
Then the news section on the business contacts would be more like busy with the SPE details. Details for like the number

Unknown Speaker  05:46
of details. Yeah, TC details? Yeah, I

Unknown Speaker  05:48
think

Unknown Speaker  05:58
it would probably be

Speaker 3  05:58
something similar to the eligible for SPE checkbox behavior, where you'd have an eligible for eicc checkbox, and then the section is displayed based on that. Sure, we're probably not eligible for eicc. But just Yeah, TC business or something like that?

Unknown Speaker  06:21
Yeah.

Matthias Miller  06:24
Are we keeping Family Information separate from we will continue keeping that on a separate record type?

Speaker 3  06:29
Yeah, yeah. It's only schools and businesses that will be merged into contact records, everything else? The records will just carry across directly. Cool.

Unknown Speaker  06:44
Cool, and,

Speaker 1  06:47
oh, as far as data access, are we are we basically putting a wall between the systems and restricting based on user login? Or? Haven't you discussed any of that yet?

Speaker 3  07:01
I don't think so. At this point, they don't have users that should only see one, one system and not the other. So remember, remembering correctly, there's not really a need for the additional permissioning. The main thing is just that a lot of menu page items will be updated to make it abundantly clear which ones are for SP and which ones are for the other side.

Unknown Speaker  07:36
Are we going to have two separate menus, like what we're

Speaker 3  07:39
Oh, yeah. And I mopped those up. There's a link to the well, I guess I can just send it here. There's a link to the to a spreadsheet with some more technical details, but then also mock ups and

Unknown Speaker  07:54
report title changes, etc. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  08:11
Cool.

Speaker 1  08:18
And then as the ultimate context, or or is there going to be any distinction between the contact that's primarily one versus the other? You're going to have any distinction on those. We're just going to

Unknown Speaker  08:33
look them before I don't think so. No. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  08:38
I mean, yeah.

Speaker 3  08:40
It'll primarily based on linking to businesses or schools, whatever, but we're not going to actually make

Unknown Speaker  08:46
a distinction. Cool.

Unknown Speaker  08:56
Okay, sounds good.

Unknown Speaker  09:02
And you have,

Speaker 1  09:04
as far as like thinking about moving forward with other design, features, change requests.

Unknown Speaker  09:09
You have stuff

Speaker 1  09:13
in a proposal, like the changes in a proposal, links back.

Speaker 3  09:18
Let's see. Yeah, I created a proposal for the merge.

Speaker 3  09:41
It's not really complete at this point. But so, yeah, I'm not creating a complete spec of what the merge system will look like at this point. This is basically just clarification about changes will work.

Unknown Speaker  10:04
Sure. menu item changes.

Unknown Speaker  10:10
And its many changes to record etc.

Unknown Speaker  10:20
See, the

Speaker 3  10:21
living specs for XRP and ZFB are both up to date at this point.

Unknown Speaker  10:26
Okay, cool.

Unknown Speaker  10:33
Okay, that's helpful.

Speaker 1  10:36
So he's just thinking about moving forward with, with the other customizations that they're willing to do.

Speaker 1  10:51
Basically, at this point, we've got the other three specs, would it be? Maybe this is a question for Matthias or LSU? We'd be good to go ahead and merge everything into one.

Unknown Speaker  11:04
We can have a unified spec.

Unknown Speaker  11:08
Or should we try to do our customizations

Unknown Speaker  11:12
and stuff so separate? And then merge the specimen? Once this is actually merged? Here, we

Matthias Miller  11:26
are going to keep two internal catalogs,

Unknown Speaker  11:28
one for each system, are you going to combine them into one kind of like?

Unknown Speaker  11:46
Good question.

Unknown Speaker  11:48
In some ways, it would be nice to have it be two separate catalogs,

Unknown Speaker  11:51
although

Unknown Speaker  11:58
I don't know. I hadn't thought that through

Matthias Miller  12:02
instinctively. Yeah, it seems to me like there's three. I mean, there's I don't know if it's helpful. If it's, I think it might be helpful to manage complexity to still have

Unknown Speaker  12:18
the concept of basically two

Matthias Miller  12:21
subsystems and a third piece, that's the bridge between the two. Or maybe in that part, it could be in the outer catalog.

Unknown Speaker  12:31
Or it could be in a third

Matthias Miller  12:33
metal catalog. If, if it doesn't get too confusing for developers to kind of know where where things lie and where they should be. And for the sake of I think you could actually make an argument for the sake of pass, I think Ellis basically said, passes off the table probably at this point.

Unknown Speaker  12:55
With these changes, but

Unknown Speaker  12:59
we have, we would have passed

Matthias Miller  13:00
to validate that, at least that side of the system continues working as expected, if we want that. So probably ultimately a question for LS. But I would say if we want to maintain two separate inner catalogs,

Unknown Speaker  13:18
so two options,

Matthias Miller  13:20
let me back up two options, one, merge them all into one catalog, treat it as one cohesive system. In that case, we should have a single client proposal. Situation two, we treat them as two subsystems, we've got two separate internal catalogs, one for each, and a place to put the bridging code and we maintain past to make sure that just for the sake of making sure the catalogs keep compiling and, and making sure we get clean separation. And in that case, I would make an argument that probably it still makes sense to keep separate client proposals.

Matthias Miller  13:58
Think the third question that we could throw in there is

Unknown Speaker  14:01
does bass builders do they think of

Matthias Miller  14:06
these as two separate departments? Or do they think of it as a single department?

Unknown Speaker  14:10
But also, what's the decision?

Speaker 1  14:24
Yeah, yeah, that would actually be a good question. To ask for you to test the plant, Nick. When you're with them, see how they, how they would do it what they would how they would envision real world

Speaker 1  14:48
I think from from the design standpoint, change requests and whatnot.

Unknown Speaker  14:55
I think you'd make good work.

Speaker 1  14:58
We have the three separate proposals, then anything that's shared, directly shared would go on the

Unknown Speaker  15:06
the third proposal or Matthias, do you think we

Unknown Speaker  15:10
would drop the third one? I think I think you decide

Speaker 2  15:19
well, the third proposal, or the third proposal be

Unknown Speaker  15:25
things that are shared, like the, like, the login portal, and email, email feature. Possibly contact and things like that, that are that are directly shared.

Speaker 2  15:49
I don't know. We, oh, we don't have

Unknown Speaker  16:03
it doesn't,

Speaker 1  16:04
it's probably not a huge deal as long as we know where to go, and how to

Unknown Speaker  16:08
access or where to go to exit. Okay,

Matthias Miller  16:12
I'm gonna amend my proposal to proposal to is, we have a single client proposal. And we have three broad sections in it. One shared stuff

Unknown Speaker  16:23
to SP specific stuff. And three, so specific stuff or something like that.

Matthias Miller  16:33
I think that's about I think that's a better proposal. Otherwise, you're gonna be Yeah, it I think it needs to be unified in some form or fashion. Otherwise, you're

Unknown Speaker  16:44
gonna get lost.

Unknown Speaker  16:50
I like that. One, one proposal record with with three sections.

Unknown Speaker  17:01
Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  17:11
Cool, no, I think I think that'd be the way to go then.

Speaker 1  17:18
And then I guess the next step, next step with that would be to go ahead and start merging. And we need to determine

Unknown Speaker  17:26
although data specs can come over with, with it, history and unit history, in this regard to the proposal to the archives.

Unknown Speaker  17:42
Is there a way to merge two proposals?

Unknown Speaker  17:51
merge duplicate has that option.

Matthias Miller  17:54
No, that deletes one. And trust me, you do not want that.

Unknown Speaker  18:01
I would think

Matthias Miller  18:07
probably the fastest way would be for Nicaragua to whip up the next 30 that takes one proposal and appends maybe even an X 30 List takes a source proposal destination proposal takes all the contents of ads are zeros. Maybe just duplicating the IDs in the other proposal, copies values over deletes ergy rows from the old one. And then leaves it to you to clean up any remaining Oh, I don't know cover letter stuff or I don't know, remaining stuff and it comes with a Here Be Dragons warning.

Unknown Speaker  18:52
This is an irreversible

Matthias Miller  18:55
process unless we make it reversible. I mean, unless we give you a way to split something back out, but

Unknown Speaker  19:06
that's not going to be pretty

Matthias Miller  19:10
Alternatively, if if I if I had an assistant, or something like that, or if one of you is so inclined, it really wouldn't take that long. It's gonna take 15 to 30 painstaking minutes to get everything transferred over and then it's done.

Unknown Speaker  19:30
So it's a little painful, but

Speaker 1  19:33
I mean, he might also not be too bad just to put this proposal side by side on a big screen and just

Unknown Speaker  19:42
copy and paste over. Yeah

Speaker 1  19:55
it may take, it might only take 15 to 30 minutes to do that.

Unknown Speaker  19:59
Well

Speaker 1  20:11
so, do you have like, do you want to do that?

Unknown Speaker  20:17
Next 30 Or if we just do the copy and paste

Matthias Miller  20:32
straight away I can test this without.

Matthias Miller  21:06
Guys, it's a dare to see if I can knock out an excerpt in

Unknown Speaker  21:09
five minutes

Unknown Speaker  21:20
okay.

Speaker 1  21:24
On the on the actual timeline, we're, we're doing the work. You all have have plans for that. Like, when you think

Unknown Speaker  21:34
you're doing the coding and I'm

Unknown Speaker  21:45
not really. I am not good with telling you exactly when I'm going to get something done. I'm

Unknown Speaker  21:58
sure. No, I it's not

Speaker 3  21:59
like it's not. It's not. Yeah. Yeah, it's not a ton of development work, actually. It's just, yeah. Actually getting the design finished out.

Unknown Speaker  22:15
And then testing and

Unknown Speaker  22:20
retesting your export import

Unknown Speaker  22:22
pairs?

Unknown Speaker  22:37
Yeah,

Speaker 1  22:37
no, that's fine. I'm not sure. Like a rush. I mean, they would want it was some other stuff by August, but I would. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  22:48
it will certainly be that before then.

Unknown Speaker  22:51
Yeah. Cool.

Unknown Speaker  23:01
Oh, all right. Go ahead. I had a question.

Matthias Miller  23:07
Oh, Tim, here's your here's your magic question. When you're asking a developer for an estimate, sort of asking them how long it's going to take ask them? Is it a day, a day, a week, a month or a year? And they will be able to give you an answer. It's, and it's usually it might be more than x and less than y. So it's more than a month less than a year more than they less than a week. Or something baby.

Speaker 3  23:37
Dad had said it should be about was it one to three weeks is what we had come up with something like that. Which that's one to three weeks of me full time, which is not I do not want to spend three weeks full time on one project.

Unknown Speaker  23:55
So yeah, yeah, that'd be great.

Unknown Speaker  24:22
And

Speaker 1  24:23
another question, Nick, that just came to mind, you know, if it would be to do this on a time material basis,

Unknown Speaker  24:29
staplers?

Unknown Speaker  24:31
Or if once you have the design,

Speaker 3  24:34
give them a place. Oh, yeah. Give them some sort of range. That way it's a project with risk for tax purposes. We do not want to be doing TNM as much as we can avoid it. So yeah, give him some sort of kind of broad range.

Unknown Speaker  25:02
Good All right

Speaker 1  25:11
anything else would be helpful for us to know

Unknown Speaker  25:18
um or anything that you need from me or any of us I don't think so

Unknown Speaker  25:33
yeah

Speaker 3  25:34
mostly just need to get around to sitting down and plugging away

Unknown Speaker  25:37
at it yeah

Unknown Speaker  25:42
also talking with the client should be helpful

Unknown Speaker  25:46
yeah sure

Unknown Speaker  25:52
what is the name of the SPE SP management

Matthias Miller  25:56
so SP management would be going into faith

Unknown Speaker  25:58
builders right say what

Matthias Miller  26:05
the SPE management would be going into the

Unknown Speaker  26:07
faith builders

Speaker 3  26:14
you seen the SP management cattle the extra fee catalog?

Matthias Miller  26:18
Which Which ones which claim proposal would be the

Unknown Speaker  26:21
one to keep x FB

Unknown Speaker  26:27
which is the

Speaker 3  26:30
SP management so this because that's how the system is being merged we're merging the older system into the newer one which Yeah, given what you discussed earlier it's not I'm not sure it's a great way of thinking about it but that's what how we have been thinking about it

Unknown Speaker  27:00
okay so.

Speaker 2  27:31
We have the proposal section ID metallurgy from pipe list concat rgmp bands

Unknown Speaker  28:27
alright so sources faithful there's so okay and then write a proposal

Unknown Speaker  28:47
proposal

Unknown Speaker  29:32
let's go do local macro migrating value parameter fields such as here the value equals fields such as cars or contents, sign the section ID is this

Unknown Speaker  30:08
Don't you like requirements the client was all

Unknown Speaker  30:53
Don't you like me to start G must be

Unknown Speaker  31:04
repeating group

Unknown Speaker  31:36
what's the name of the main memo they're

Unknown Speaker  31:38
the main memo like requirements

Speaker 2  31:46
yes good I got it that's back okay so this is Dr G

Speaker 2  32:09
alright let's see if this works. source would be phased builders destination would be SPE Oh we should maybe copy the title too while we're at it

Unknown Speaker  32:28
proposal section

Matthias Miller  32:33
name so it's just section name requirements to spec in history the right

Unknown Speaker  32:41
section

Unknown Speaker  32:47
right would we be bringing over the app only be active

Unknown Speaker  32:53
now we'd be bringing over everything and you bring it over

Unknown Speaker  33:02
pretty over the inactive as yes

Matthias Miller  33:09
the inactive need to be copied what's the name of the indent column

Unknown Speaker  33:16
first one

Unknown Speaker  33:24
that's actually

Unknown Speaker  33:32
be streamed back to the value we're gonna do active active is

Unknown Speaker  33:58
section

Unknown Speaker  34:17
well

Matthias Miller  34:24
here's what we'll do. One of you

Unknown Speaker  34:28
can oops. Go into Settings. hit Preview. Fill in the prompts.

Matthias Miller  34:44
And carefully review it make sure it's going to do what you got to do.

Unknown Speaker  34:49
And then once you're

Unknown Speaker  34:58
and then once you Have you

Matthias Miller  35:01
got that then you can double and triple check and go run it and

Unknown Speaker  35:09
there you go so first proposal I should database

Unknown Speaker  35:31
SPE

Unknown Speaker  35:34
Oh it just SP I continue this is a soft previewing here

Unknown Speaker  35:41
yep, that's all previewing

Unknown Speaker  35:43
you know continue

Matthias Miller  35:47
and then in the right pane you might even be able to pop out that right pane there

Unknown Speaker  35:55
open it in a new

Unknown Speaker  36:01
oh well

Speaker 1  36:04
yeah opens a new window it opens the whole bottom bottom thing in a new window new window I can't bring out a tab

Speaker 1  36:25
then this would be showing the full combined

Matthias Miller  36:30
like this yeah, there's a full combined spec with the with the faithful There's one at the bottom

Unknown Speaker  36:41
yeah which

Unknown Speaker  36:50
well yeah I mean, we can flip the order of that if you

Unknown Speaker  37:02
want to know that it matters we just have to add some indenting and whatnot to get the jurisdiction properly set up okay cool okay, well that gives us something to

Speaker 1  37:38
follow or thumbs over or to work on when we otherwise it'd be totally here

Speaker 1  37:55
cool well I'm gonna put this in the eMERGE incident

Unknown Speaker  38:03
and we got to plan for tackling that right here in the near future with.

Speaker 1  38:22
And Matthias does it does this retain the old original source proposal?

Matthias Miller  38:30
Or the yes it does. You'll need to then just rename the old one and know that it was migrated to the other one and archive it

Unknown Speaker  38:41
Tim Are you seeing that what is going on?

Speaker 1  39:37
So basically here, we're gonna start with this screen now.

Unknown Speaker  39:53
I'm

Speaker 3  39:56
what I'm seeing currently Is that the SP management proposal is just being copied in itself is just being duplicated

Unknown Speaker  40:09
oh it's just being duplicated that's probably an easy fix should be expression the Ask source proposal wait because we went through each other's energy source expression I'm looking at up off the source and doing look at global fuel source proposal okay so we do great builders

Speaker 2  40:41
look migrate value well no she let's do this Yes. As she

Unknown Speaker  41:06
shoulda

Unknown Speaker  41:19
wind will do

Unknown Speaker  41:38
yes training

Unknown Speaker  41:49
the mind SP y cat Archie calm desperate posle oh here's why no destination proposal Ste is a destination source is that

Unknown Speaker  42:17
Luke source expression let's do this. Let's turn off the new asset now that is the new engine Well, let's do a proposal name

Speaker 3  42:33
is your load source expression I think you're wanting a reference parameter not an assigned parameter che

Unknown Speaker  42:51
and we check the load migrate value as well I did right okay so that's looking a little better okay

Unknown Speaker  43:12
so from source SPE

Unknown Speaker  43:25
the order is getting messed up we've got software Terms and Conditions

Unknown Speaker  43:59
well I think maybe we should

Unknown Speaker  44:08
of course look

Matthias Miller  44:08
fine expectations look fine soccer. Oh, that's because those are inactive I

Unknown Speaker  44:22
find

Matthias Miller  44:26
I don't know if that's exactly how it was laid out in the original one but

Unknown Speaker  44:28
let's do a table there's an SPE Yeah.

Matthias Miller  44:42
There are no inactive ones here. Okay. I think it's working but I could be wrong.

Unknown Speaker  44:50
Okay, well, we'll plan into

Unknown Speaker  45:17
All right, well, good enough?

Speaker 1  45:27
Yeah, I'll plan to follow up on that later then. And I think then that covers all that we had to do for next year.

Unknown Speaker  45:39
All right.

Speaker 3  45:42
Shall we together parts in that case? Yep. With that. I shall Jaime away to other parts in that case. All righty.

Unknown Speaker  45:58
See? Yes. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  46:06
All right.

Speaker 1  46:12
Let's see here. Ben, do you have any called LS here to

Unknown Speaker  46:20
know? He's maybe he's not doing.

Speaker 1  46:28
So we could, we can go until 230?

Unknown Speaker  46:34
As long as you're

Speaker 1  46:37
available for that? Yep. All right. So some CWA stuff first off incident 7712?

Unknown Speaker  46:52
Well, actually, let me first

Unknown Speaker  46:56
which is a sequence we should go through. They're all kind of interrelated.

Unknown Speaker  47:09
Okay,

Speaker 1  47:09
first one is actually 7356.

Speaker 1  47:20
So this Matthias was designed that we had put together for good clients include a second document with an existing printout. And this is the documents they already have as attached as a PDF. They're in their wiki. But we were a plan is to replace the PDF and the wiki with the actual textbook format of text that the system can then just look at and add in the printout additional pages. So that's, that's context were for that. And so we ran that by the client, basically, we would be this year vehicle guidelines sheet, instead of opening up the the wiki page with the PDF, it would directly open up the PDF, because the wiki page would have the text. So we talked about the client, who was good with that. Yeah, wanted to understand a little bit more. So you talked about that. And then they also were wanting to add a second documents with another printout. And that is that was that was partially dependent on the east signatures feature that they're pulling off on for now.

Unknown Speaker  49:01
So as

Speaker 1  49:03
soon as they're playing hold off on that for now, we're thinking, well, we could take that and do the same thing there of take the text out of the Google Doc, paste it into a wiki doc wiki page, and then pull it out and add it to the printout.

Speaker 1  49:26
But then, as we were talking about that, so talking about that, realize that maybe what we should do, instead of using Wiki pages for all of this, we should use other configuration record. Because what we're doing currently is we have a abolition setting page we have three references wiki and these are the ones that show up on the the main menu here and then each of those has a PDF in

Unknown Speaker  50:02
it for tax debt all through their a PDS.

Speaker 1  50:09
But we also have over a year the figure of a custom record over here configure handbook that they're going to drop the PDF in and,

Unknown Speaker  50:21
and printed direct.

Speaker 1  50:27
Yeah, I'm just wondering if if we should use configuration records and have all of the things the same place because currently what they want to update anyway, you have to go to, if you go find the right wiki for three of them, handbook, they have to find the handbook record.

Unknown Speaker  50:48
What Why do we have multiple handbook records?

Unknown Speaker  50:52
We only have one. Okay.

Speaker 1  50:55
It's only for the notes like this, the only record the only record, they just, I think created that custom record so that they can then print it, set it up so that they could print it here. Just print the PDF directly

Unknown Speaker  51:23
what do I think I mean?

Unknown Speaker  51:37
And then, if we did

Speaker 1  51:38
that, the other ones here. These other menu options to print the allowed vehicles. There's a quick on the on the menu options, then they have to open opens the wiki page, and then they find the PDFs. And then they have and so for some of these menu options here there, they click on the menu option it opens a PDF directly other ones they have to go to the wiki and then they have to he's just wondering about like streamlining, centralizing, making everything more more consistent for the admins use of updating stuff and positive agents benefit in consistency and what happens. So, are they willing to keep using the wiki?

Unknown Speaker  52:26
Um, they

Speaker 1  52:28
I don't know, I don't know what they really use it for much other than accessing those documents. We do have tutorial videos in there. But other than that, I don't think there really

Unknown Speaker  52:39
are anything right now

Unknown Speaker  52:50
your shortcut?

Speaker 1  52:51
Yeah, I don't know that use really other than to access those PDFs.

Matthias Miller  52:58
So here's an option change that have a resource lookup type with a name, and we ship it with these whatever types of resources we want. It's a simple memo field. The only difference between this and a

Unknown Speaker  53:13
wiki page

Matthias Miller  53:16
is that it doesn't have a title and it doesn't have a wiki ID

Speaker 1  53:30
we could add we could give it a title if we probably would want to give it a title identify what what resource it is,

Matthias Miller  53:40
well it would be we would have a read only type field for the ones that are shipped

Speaker 2  53:45
or name or whatever it is. Oh sure. So like like your handbook

Unknown Speaker  53:54
it would be something like a really tight field yeah

Matthias Miller  53:56
sorry type or name whatever it is resource name it would be handbook or whatever all the other resources are that they want

Unknown Speaker  54:22
and then

Unknown Speaker  54:33
and then they get a drop there either text or their PDF

Matthias Miller  54:42
Yeah, with you know, ship records for for industrial zone, whatever we call them platform

Unknown Speaker  54:49
record records for.

Matthias Miller  54:59
Now And then what happens with the video tutorials? Just one more resource type

Speaker 1  55:15
I don't know we could just we just leave the wiki there and even if they want to use it at some point

Matthias Miller  55:22
so but if they want to use the wiki then why don't we have a category for

Unknown Speaker  55:25
configuration settings

Unknown Speaker  55:30
and

Speaker 1  55:41
think the main thing is that then from the wiki, we can't open the PDF directly from the menu

Unknown Speaker  55:48
the menu option if I remember right

Speaker 1  55:55
that's why the handbook record types especially that it could open up well

Unknown Speaker  56:11
we it's all matter of semantics.

Speaker 2  56:24
Let's say it is a wiki, you have a

Matthias Miller  56:30
configuration category type that's only editable by

Unknown Speaker  56:34
administrators.

Matthias Miller  56:38
The first time you set these up, you still have to configure them in that posting settings anytime we add a new one, whenever we do the update, we have to go in create a new wiki for them link in the settings. As part of the update after that, we can choose how all of these works are going to jump back to your menu options.

Matthias Miller  57:00
So view handbook, does that open the link directly?

Speaker 1  57:04
Yes, so that opens the attachment as a PDF attachment directly from the hands

Matthias Miller  57:10
Oh, it's pretty easy. Go see if go see change this one to look at the wiki. If it has a PDF file attachment, it opens the first one and if not, it opens it generates the wiki as a PDF or just opens the wiki

Unknown Speaker  57:34
okay

Unknown Speaker  57:41
okay, yeah, if we can do that, I think that

Unknown Speaker  57:45
that'd be great.

Matthias Miller  57:46
The Configure is just a matter of launching a wiki for opening the appropriate wiki and even with that, like we could almost tell them just go into the wiki whenever you want to change these

Matthias Miller  58:09
and then we need to set up a restricted data policy that only administrators can can modify these wiki documents or maybe I mean maybe only administrators administrators can ever modify modify wiki documents I don't know

Unknown Speaker  58:41
let me just make sure I'm not lying to you on this but I don't think I am

Unknown Speaker  58:59
as promised it's a beaut document like wow I mean

Unknown Speaker  59:21
what happens if you

Unknown Speaker  59:34
you book configure handbook. What happens if I do a component wherever you are all right doesn't work.

Matthias Miller  59:52
Okay, I mean, the bottom line is

Unknown Speaker  1:00:14
So they have multiple allowed vehicles

Unknown Speaker  1:00:18
yes allow

Speaker 1  1:00:18
vehicles has been clicked on that currently there are two PDFs in there basically because the years there's so many different themes

Unknown Speaker  1:00:30
and different ones for different years

Unknown Speaker  1:00:34
got it? So this would end up being three separate

Unknown Speaker  1:00:36
ones to 20 the other one and so we'll just

Matthias Miller  1:00:44
I mean those the why why why why is just 2001 to 2000

Unknown Speaker  1:00:47
whatever it is and got it

Unknown Speaker  1:01:08
really just

Matthias Miller  1:01:09
replace current year with something like today

Unknown Speaker  1:01:11
we're Yeah

Unknown Speaker  1:02:00
something like that

Unknown Speaker  1:02:09
but and if you wanted

Matthias Miller  1:02:10
to we could actually there more than one or more PDFs in the memo open a report showing the the

Speaker 2  1:02:19
open a report showing the file names

Unknown Speaker  1:02:28
if there's more than one or multiple

Matthias Miller  1:02:33
so there's one one PDF and memo open that went directly if there are multiple PDFs memo

Unknown Speaker  1:02:41
show a list of PDFs

Speaker 1  1:02:48
I think this I think this will be fine okay we're wanting to split these you would like the ideas putting the split these anyway

Unknown Speaker  1:02:57
okay and then technical details

Unknown Speaker  1:03:07
create a standard

Matthias Miller  1:03:15
open wiki attachment or PDF

Unknown Speaker  1:03:20
open

Speaker 1  1:03:22
wiki you just type it out you're welcome to do that too. Let's do that.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:44
And then we will also need to we would also need to replace the existing

Speaker 2  1:04:53
EU handbook. I'm sorry, the listing handbook record

Matthias Miller  1:05:01
Well I would just I mean, why did we then need the configuration like can we just have a Can I mean if we need something have a configured resources that goes into the wiki for the I mean, do we even need a configure anymore

Unknown Speaker  1:05:21
probably not as long as the admins know where

Matthias Miller  1:05:28
we can have a configure resources that just opens the

Unknown Speaker  1:05:32
wiki but and that might be helpful just to reduce confusion

Matthias Miller  1:05:47
prior to the update we should go ahead and set up the new wiki pages with appropriate file attachments

Unknown Speaker  1:05:57
up in Oh in the

Unknown Speaker  1:06:01
in the live system

Matthias Miller  1:06:08
and do we need a special Do we need a custom custom labels on the wiki to tell them that they can drag and drop PDFs into their

Unknown Speaker  1:06:17
like we do in the handbook

Unknown Speaker  1:06:28
I could ask I don't

Unknown Speaker  1:06:36
know that we do but maybe we have I mean

Unknown Speaker  1:06:40
kind of seems like at some point

Matthias Miller  1:06:44
we can just create another week wiki document and instructions and have good

Unknown Speaker  1:07:22
all right

Unknown Speaker  1:07:51
okay

Unknown Speaker  1:08:19
all right well I

Unknown Speaker  1:08:26
think that makes

Unknown Speaker  1:08:42
and then oh I guess we would also have

Unknown Speaker  1:08:49
this mastered.

Speaker 1  1:09:23
Then what we're doing over here are the HIPAA guidelines document we would keep that one as is we can go ahead with that

Unknown Speaker  1:09:33
and then work on

Speaker 1  1:09:36
on this. And then I need to find out a little bit more information about how this

Speaker 2  1:09:41
would be refreshed on what the reference we ease works and whether we need to continue with that.

Speaker 1  1:09:54
Yeah, it might be helpful in this whole process.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:00
To change the

Unknown Speaker  1:10:04
change that particular

Unknown Speaker  1:10:08
I don't know if it matters it doesn't matter nevermind

Unknown Speaker  1:10:22
yeah I mean

Matthias Miller  1:10:25
the reference wikis we would still need to keep these unless you've got a different way to specify okay that these are special resources

Unknown Speaker  1:10:45
unless you've got yeah

Unknown Speaker  1:10:55
okay I mean

Matthias Miller  1:11:05
the other way we could have done this is to make the make that a

Unknown Speaker  1:11:11
drop list

Matthias Miller  1:11:14
make that a resource type on the wiki validate that you don't have more than one warn if any of the resource types are missing

Matthias Miller  1:11:32
but I don't

Unknown Speaker  1:11:36
know if this is if this is the simplest way to do it

Unknown Speaker  1:11:54
okay

Unknown Speaker  1:12:01
then

Unknown Speaker  1:12:07
yeah that sounds good

Unknown Speaker  1:12:10
we will I plan to pick this up and

Unknown Speaker  1:12:12
later follow up on it and I had

Unknown Speaker  1:12:20
I think we should be tracking time actually on this 7712 Switch it to 7356 but they've practiced

Unknown Speaker  1:12:31
so much in there then

Unknown Speaker  1:12:46
see what else you've got a

Matthias Miller  1:12:50
minor note on the master agreement can you just call it the print new member packet

Unknown Speaker  1:12:58
number packet

Matthias Miller  1:13:01
packet into packet on a socket on the port and the bus is interrupted it's a very last resort and the address of the memory makes the floppy disk worse than the socket packet packet has an error to report

Speaker 2  1:13:16
all right, sure. Door I caught some amount of floppy disk

Matthias Miller  1:13:28
Dr. Seuss becomes

Speaker 1  1:13:40
okay, then quickly going through this 178367

Unknown Speaker  1:13:55
So, yes, I

Unknown Speaker  1:13:55
like the idea of the packet.

Speaker 1  1:14:22
I think these are things this this I can follow up on. The next one, this is a I don't know if you want me to ask you this question or Alice's question and talks about validation. How validations work do you want to jump into that

Unknown Speaker  1:14:39
a little bit or do you just say first

Unknown Speaker  1:14:49
today they want to make sure that they print the new member card.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:53
Right so like clients

Speaker 1  1:15:03
So currently print new member card is this little checkbox down here? And when you check the box gives you a link, and you have to save the record. And then yeah, then you can print the card. But he was he's saying it's pretty important to make sure that that gets printed every time. Because it that gets the signature on the paper that they sent to, to the state to show who's on and who's degree. So, yeah, he was wondering about making that required. So we're thinking about that a little bit. Do we make it required that that checkbox be filled in order to add a vehicle or

Unknown Speaker  1:15:57
something like that? Thank goodness,

Speaker 1  1:16:01
that is some of that is also on him to think through because we were talking about different different angles, different ways to be wired. And he was thinking about different scenarios where validation or that validation wouldn't work because of how they want to go to do.

Matthias Miller  1:16:23
Well, it sounds like that's probably number one. I mean, you could add validation that you can't activate a vehicle.

Unknown Speaker  1:16:36
Yeah, activate the vehicle.

Matthias Miller  1:16:38
And then you have to think through how transfers work. Right.

Speaker 1  1:16:44
And I think that was part of what he was, what he was thinking, maybe was thinking about transfer thing.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:03
What do we think?

Speaker 1  1:17:04
I think, I mean, if, if you don't have any great ideas, and that's, that's fine, we can hear. I have a great idea. This is an exception alert.

Matthias Miller  1:17:16
That gets sent to the admins, they get shown to the to the user and gets sent to the admins saying, Hey, you didn't print something.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:25
So thanks wrong.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:30
I don't know that they like it, you can still save it.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:34
But every

Speaker 1  1:17:37
time they save it, they're gonna get basically a warning saying, Hey, this is missing and the admin really included

Matthias Miller  1:17:48
Yes, something like that. Or it's an icon that shows up in the taskbar. I mean, you can think through all the scenarios where

Unknown Speaker  1:18:08
this,

Matthias Miller  1:18:09
this need this validation needs to happen.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:13
Right.

Speaker 1  1:18:16
I think the one downside with that is this one more alert to the admins. They have to

Unknown Speaker  1:18:22
chase down.

Speaker 1  1:18:24
Sure. And he was wanting to put it in the agents court where it forces the agent to do something about it. Well

Unknown Speaker  1:18:40
yeah, I don't know that I've got much to really get much to add to that.

Speaker 1  1:18:56
Sure, good. I'll just in here to.

Speaker 1  1:19:17
And then, one more question on that. Is, is there a cleaner or better way to print something like this? Then clicking the checkbox and implicitly you remember why we why we did that checkbox and link

Unknown Speaker  1:19:36
that of a button or something like that.

Matthias Miller  1:19:42
Because we don't really have a way to do an x 30 plus open a document okay.

Unknown Speaker  1:19:56
So like some of the other things that we're printing

Unknown Speaker  1:20:02
On the contact?

Speaker 1  1:20:06
No, I'm sorry, on the vehicles. We're printing documents just from a link there. Oh, but I guess, there we don't need to track the date. That's part of this too is it tracks the date of the checkboxes as the pretty

Unknown Speaker  1:20:36
What am I think?

Unknown Speaker  1:20:39
I'm not necessarily looking to reinvent the wheel unless there's a

Unknown Speaker  1:20:44
better wheel to be invented. So,

Matthias Miller  1:20:50
I mean, the only the only other, like, how are you going to literally verify that they click the

Unknown Speaker  1:20:56
link? I mean, I think

Matthias Miller  1:20:59
the option that you have is the print card is always visible. And then you have a button that says, I signed it. Because the print print card is going to kick it out of edit mode, and then we have an x 30. That flags is signed with a signature date.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:21
I mean,

Matthias Miller  1:21:24
seems like splitting hairs at that point.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:26
Yeah. Yeah, no, that's

Matthias Miller  1:21:31
just me. Ultimately, e signatures are the answer. Did you sign in? Did you not we know definitively Did you sign it? And do we have a copy? Yes, we do. No, we don't.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:42
Until then, I think this is. Yeah. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:21:54
I like the answer. Digital signatures. Is there a more streamlined way? Yes. Yes, there is. Digital signatures, is it saying?

Unknown Speaker  1:22:26
Okay, cool.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:33
Well, 222, I

Speaker 1  1:22:40
think that is probably, I'm good with wrapping it up here I

Matthias Miller  1:22:54
owe, on that whole three letter code, I feel fairly strongly that core should be forwarded for letters.

Unknown Speaker  1:23:03
And I'm willing to

Matthias Miller  1:23:05
go to bat and are you for that? And I forget where that conversation was. But anyway, for whatever it's worth. And I might be persuaded otherwise. But so they

Unknown Speaker  1:23:21
go ahead.

Matthias Miller  1:23:23
Core is not a client, I mean, this specific is unique. And it should be unique. It is not a client code. It's something completely different.

Speaker 1  1:23:33
So it's it's more of a it's a billing type rather than

Unknown Speaker  1:23:44
Yes,

Matthias Miller  1:23:46
well, it's not a billing type. It's a module kind of

Unknown Speaker  1:23:53
plays to multiple systems.

Unknown Speaker  1:23:55
Well, it's kind of a billing type I guess. I don't know.

Matthias Miller  1:24:00
I get what you're saying you want to split hairs between

Unknown Speaker  1:24:06
what system does it belong

Matthias Miller  1:24:07
to? And what's the billing type?

Speaker 1  1:24:11
Right that's kind of where it goes like client code would refer more specifically to the system. Of course the specific any ones

Unknown Speaker  1:24:25
sometimes do. And there would be times that we would

Speaker 1  1:24:32
code a feature for a certain Boris was the client as code as for because

Speaker 2  1:24:37
we want it to be part of a standard module or something.

Speaker 1  1:24:44
I think lsn dimension has suggested the idea of adding it as a

Speaker 2  1:24:49
as a billing type. That might be the direction to go. Would that be solution provider Oh maybe

Matthias Miller  1:25:06
anyway going so I don't know if it actually is probably closer to billing type and then you could have a than allowing client code to be blank

Unknown Speaker  1:25:17
for recording corbelling

Matthias Miller  1:25:21
Okay, well I should probably drop it with my water bottle out my car and be nice to have my next call. So I'm the one for wine yet, not you

Unknown Speaker  1:25:31
All right. Sounds good.

Unknown Speaker  1:25:35
Yep, thanks. Yep,

Unknown Speaker  1:25:37
that
