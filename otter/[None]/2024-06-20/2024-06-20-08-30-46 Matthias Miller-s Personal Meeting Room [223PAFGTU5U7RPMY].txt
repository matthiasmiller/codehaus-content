Unknown Speaker  00:20
Hey, morning, Joel,

Unknown Speaker  00:24
Hey, First, hello.

Unknown Speaker  00:29
All right, bye.

Unknown Speaker  01:13
Well, I guess

Matthias Miller  01:16
we are on for this morning,

Unknown Speaker  01:19
maybe call Mark.

Unknown Speaker  01:23
He just sent over an agenda.

Unknown Speaker  01:28
He's he's on his way. Then we're just running a couple minutes later.

Unknown Speaker  01:45
We're starting with Joel this morning, right? Yep,

Unknown Speaker  01:48
great. I'm

Matthias Miller  01:58
gonna switch over to my other screen, which I Should have done originally, anyway,

Unknown Speaker  02:04
so I was lazy. I

Unknown Speaker  02:32
where drew Hey, good morning.

Unknown Speaker  02:34
Hey, good morning.

Unknown Speaker  02:40
I forgot that the Wi Fi here needs to be corded.

Unknown Speaker  02:47
I like it. The Wi Fi needs to be corded.

Matthias Miller  02:55
Old meets new. It does raise a few questions about about the details of that.

Unknown Speaker  03:13
Good morning,

Unknown Speaker  03:15
morning Mark. All

Matthias Miller  03:22
right, so changing up format. Here's that Joel doesn't have to be on the call as long we're going to my thought was maybe going forward having Joel join for the first part of the project management for his pieces, then he can drop off. And we haven't lately had a had much stuff that needs Joel's attention. And if we do, maybe we could look at scheduling that for like a one o'clock Eastern or Well, or maybe past that, for Joel's sake, but having a separate Well, there's a few ways we can play it either, either we can. We can design it start, start this meeting on design, and then just bring Audra on whenever we're done with that, or just have a separate call later in the day for design with Joel, if, if we need that, I think we can cross that bridge when we get there. I them.

Speaker 1  04:23
So I guess anything from Mark or drew before we jump in,

Speaker 2  04:31
one thing, which I don't think is a big deal, future meetings, I don't know about next week the schedule, but no, you're I think next two or three weeks you're, you are not able to join, but Drew's going to be in Missouri for starting next week through. What is it August?

Unknown Speaker  04:56
Probably middle of August. Yeah.

Speaker 2  05:02
So as far as I know, we can still do these calls. I'll just be on the phone and won't be able to

Unknown Speaker  05:10
which I don't know that.

Speaker 2  05:12
I mean a little bit handicapped, depending on what we're doing, like screen shares,

Unknown Speaker  05:17
but true. Otherwise, I don't

Speaker 2  05:21
You got me? Okay? So, yeah, we're dropping the meeting next week, and the fourth completely. Is that correct, right?

Matthias Miller  05:30
That is, that is correct. If you would want a meeting on I'm not sure what the third is going to be like for me, so I'm leaving that open right now. But if you would want a makeup meeting on the first to of course, that's the first of the month, best day ever for meetings for you guys, probably. But if you want your knee that I'm open to that

Speaker 2  05:57
you're going to be settled in by them right like the first and that would work or not? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  06:02
it's going to be iffy.

Speaker 2  06:07
I get a little bit nervous not having a meeting at all for two weeks just because of

Speaker 3  06:14
things that are I mean, I would think I can make something work for the first

Matthias Miller  06:21
could we do? I could also do Tuesday afternoon, as late in your day as POS the bowl, probably 230 Eastern would be about the soonest I would want to do it.

Unknown Speaker  06:37
This would be the second

Speaker 4  06:39
the second Tuesday, the second, that would probably

Unknown Speaker  06:43
work better for me than the first, but yeah,

Speaker 2  06:46
I could make that work. I too. Why don't we do that? And then are we good to I apologize, Audra, I know you'd send out daze. Matthias, it's all I just know

Speaker 5  06:57
that that's okay. I was going to actually just throw out there too while you're discussing July, 11 and the 25th right now are the only days that we have scheduled through the end of July, from like now until the end of July, there's two meetings currently scheduled. So if you do want to take some time on that, that makes sense to me, you're saying the 11th and the 18th, right or no, the 11th and the 25th are the only days that, yeah, Matthias currently has on a Thursday. So, okay,

Speaker 2  07:24
well, I think that's good, July 2, the 11th and the 25th Okay, excellent. I was not needing to have as many meetings. Is a sign that we're putting to implementation, or that things are, are

Unknown Speaker  07:46
working right?

Speaker 6  07:50
And I'm just realizing, I mean, I'm guessing that I'm not essential to that meeting, but I'm realizing I do actually, I am booked 830 to 10 on the second.

Matthias Miller  08:06
Okay, we would be, this would be an afternoon at, okay, 230 Eastern. Gotcha? I think 230 to four, does that? Is that what you're thinking? Work,

Speaker 7  08:18
yeah, okay, okay. I let you move the

Unknown Speaker  08:25
Thursday man over to then,

Speaker 5  08:29
230 to four Eastern Time on July 2. Will do good deal working session and the project updates, just drag those bugs over to the second

Matthias Miller  08:48
or just project Yeah. I mean, let's just put in project updates and Okay, those we just have people, I mean, yeah, we'll go through projects in any other conversations that we need to have 90 minutes and Joel only probably needs to be there for

Unknown Speaker  09:07
a very little bit. Okay, cool. Sounds good.

Speaker 5  09:11
All right, should we move on and get to Joel? Then, fantastic. Add cash flow statement. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  09:23
so

Speaker 6  09:28
functional, but slow, although it's so initially I communicated, it's horribly slow, and it will get better. Now it's, I'd say it's slow and and functional and will take quite a bit of work to get a lot faster. So at this point. I'm I'm not pushing the speed, unless, unless you all tell me that, that we should do so.

Speaker 2  10:15
Quick question on, like, the on the speed, like, where we're at right now, we've got quite a bit of work before, on our side, before we're ready to start heavily using cash flow statements. I don't think there's a huge urgency there, but do you know what needs done to speed it up, and how much time I

Unknown Speaker  10:44
those things tend to be pretty iterative.

Unknown Speaker  10:50
So

Speaker 6  10:56
I mean, the quick answer is no, not with anything close to a satisfactory degree of precision.

Unknown Speaker  11:11
But I'd say as

Speaker 6  11:21
I don't know, so I'd about say, as you start using it,

Unknown Speaker  11:26
then

Speaker 6  11:29
we should see if it's a significant problem, and then look at start and trying to figure out, okay, spend, spend this much time working on it, and see if, where we can, how far we can move it forward, and if we can get a clearer idea of what more might

Matthias Miller  11:51
that's cool. Could okay, just to interject, can we do use record totals here and have something like monthly record totals per account with daily record totals. And so you do monthly for the entire month ranges supplement with dailies for the other side. And then you can also use the same thing on the balance sheet to make the balance sheet and income statement fast as well.

Speaker 6  12:15
Yes, I think some of that is definitely a possibility. I And

Speaker 6  12:25
yeah, yeah, one so Mark and drew. You don't need to listen to this, but Matthias the the expressions in parsing the expressions themselves is actually one big piece of it. Cool. So that's an interesting, interesting challenge.

Unknown Speaker  12:57
So interesting, cool. Okay,

Speaker 5  13:07
so in terms of status or dates or anything related to this, what are we doing with

Unknown Speaker  13:14
it? Um,

Speaker 6  13:16
Mark and drew. Would you be happy with if I Lolly it over to you as basically for for your testing and reporting back if, if you find there are ways that it's not, that it's not serving purposes,

Unknown Speaker  13:52
Yeah, I'm good with that.

Speaker 3  13:54
Is it on the menu for counter report? Is it okay? I

Unknown Speaker  13:59
think there are, actually, oh, there we go. Audrey, can you scroll up just a bit

Unknown Speaker  14:11
here? Oh, yeah.

Speaker 6  14:15
Well, and actually, I could turn those on for Yeah. So there are two switches to turn on in the system too. The first one makes the report available. The second one adds sub panes that basically help to prove it out. Should I turn that on in live for you?

Unknown Speaker  14:39
I would, I would guess, so that would be helpful,

Unknown Speaker  14:40
yeah, and if it's helpful, Oh,

Speaker 6  14:44
oops, sorry. I think that update is not actually in live yet. So,

Unknown Speaker  14:50
like, unless,

Speaker 2  14:54
would it be worth you just showing us showing drew in the test system, how to use it for. It once it's live, so that, or is it, is it so basic or easy to know how to use it that it's there's no value there?

Speaker 6  15:09
Okay, there might be value in, especially in setting up, I think there would be value

Unknown Speaker  15:18
setting up accounts to make sure they're they fit into the right places, and just looking a bit at at how the sub panes

Speaker 6  15:36
prove out what's in the report and what you might want to compare them again. So

Speaker 2  15:44
I'm thinking when like, like, I said, it's not super urgent for us right now. The only reason that I think we might want to look at it there might be value in looking at it today is, well, Drew is still here, and we can, like, you can do a screen share, and we can both kind of see how it's working. But I don't know if you have you have time today to do that or not, like we could. We usually have a three o'clock in the afternoon as well.

Speaker 6  16:17
Okay? I um, although is that Matthias is time,

Unknown Speaker  16:27
if we need it, it's

Matthias Miller  16:29
Eastern, so it would be 2pm Central, sure.

Speaker 6  16:36
Oh, sorry, I was mostly saying brother zone. I was saying is that, is that time that you have booked to work on, on your stuff, that that I would be pushing into?

Unknown Speaker  16:54
No, I mean, it's,

Matthias Miller  16:57
you can get it all. I can get all my stuff taken care of. Sure, okay,

Speaker 6  17:05
well, I believe I would be available at you said, Two Eastern, sorry, three Eastern, okay, let me just add

Unknown Speaker  17:21
a

Matthias Miller  17:24
I'll add you to the invite. Great,

Unknown Speaker  17:26
great. Thank you, yep.

Unknown Speaker  17:34
So plan to do that at three today.

Unknown Speaker  17:38
Sounds good here. Okay, good. Okay, going

Speaker 5  17:43
to go ahead and put this over in Drew's court as a task? I guess I just did that. Cleared it out. That look good. All right. What about any date with

Unknown Speaker  17:58
the put the due date out a

Unknown Speaker  18:07
little change.

Matthias Miller  18:10
You don't want to be penalized for Joel's. Yeah, I don't think it's tardiness, just how the dice rolls. All

Unknown Speaker  18:22
right? There. All right, we'll leave it as is. I see this one was delegated to Jonathan, so exactly, but Joel, is this still? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  18:32
okay, there's Matthias. Do you want to

Matthias Miller  18:37
Yeah? So, well, sorry, I don't really care. Yeah, go for it. Go for it. It's bottom line is, this is a four to 5k project, just the depth of to have a junior or to have have Seth do it. So I didn't go into the details of how it's exactly going to be done, Joel, is this indices and things like that, primarily,

Speaker 6  19:10
presumably, and research, I mean, in research, may even, may even involve some of those totals you're mentioning. Well, General Ledger transaction less likely. It

Matthias Miller  19:26
is less likely. Yeah, and some of it is also just the you know, some of the criteria we can likely speed up very well, and others will be more difficult to see that, depending on the criteria you're searching for.

Unknown Speaker  19:47
Now is this,

Speaker 2  19:50
like you've kind of found ways to work around this group, but long term, you do, we do want this, right? I mean, we do want it like if this were working well, you. Use it a lot. Yeah, now is there? So, I mean, it's, it's not something that's urgent, but it's something that we need at some point. So is talking to Ellis and Josh the other day, just about development kind of overall, you know? And they mentioned that depending what the project is, if we have time, and if we have time, depending what the project is, it's a better fit for a more junior developer. And this is something that like whether Seth does it, or Joel or Matthias or or Josh it, it's going to cost about the same, right? Like he was just saying, you know, there's using a junior developer. Obviously, it's, it's cheaper, you know, right, by the hour, but it'll also take a lot longer than a senior developer. So you're saying it's, it's, this is probably the most, the best way to do it, as far as, like, we're not saving, okay, the time frame we're we're good with, and we're not saving. There's not much difference on the price tag. One way versus the other is there.

Speaker 6  21:19
I think that's a fair baseline assumption. Matthias, I'm not sure if you're agreeing. I'm

Matthias Miller  21:25
not sure if I agree. Okay, I think if, if. Okay. General Ledger, we've got accounting company. If it's only subsetting indexing, we've got report period. We already have indices. I've used indices in the transaction criteria for date ranges, that's easy, accounts, that's indices, that's easy. Classes we don't use. But even that's easy, hide starting balance does not affect this. Contacts, that's indexed, that's easy. I don't see how general converting General Ledger over is, I don't, I don't see how he couldn't substantially beat that.

Unknown Speaker  22:11
Take a look to register.

Speaker 3  22:15
Well, question. So, so if we went through and had him do it, like, what kind of speed change would we be coming up with? I mean, would this be a 50% faster or a 90% faster or 10% faster? Like, you know, if it's 90% faster, I would say, Oh yeah, 50% maybe 10% No, definitely not. Yeah, I

Unknown Speaker  22:44
can do this for

Matthias Miller  22:47
not more than two grand and get it 90% faster. I'm pretty confident. I might be cocky, but this is not i

Unknown Speaker  23:04
Yeah, no, I

Matthias Miller  23:07
might want to hedge my bets just a little bit before it right. But it just doesn't. I just don't, and yes, 90% I just don't think, I don't think the bottleneck is in anything besides the subset. Joel,

Speaker 6  23:25
okay, well, I mean, if that's No, that's there's

Matthias Miller  23:29
no grouping on the one. Okay, so report rows could start showing immediately. Okay, okay. General Ledger, I'm not able to pull up the settings for because it's some kind of there's some proprietary stuff.

Speaker 2  23:44
So the reason for asking this is, and we'll talk about this on our dev priorities meeting, is that we're looking to up until now, we've just like our software development was just kind of, what's the capacity? Let's just go ahead and do it right. And we're saying now that we probably should have a quota, you know, like, and so that's where we need you guys help. Like, we need it like, something like this. We needed to be faster. But what is the one, one way versus the other, which is the most effective way to do it? So I mean, looking at this and what I'm hearing, Matthias, I'd say, fit it in, into your schedule when you have time. And well, we'll go with your optimistic

Matthias Miller  24:38
suggestion. This might be the sales brain than me talking. So hopefully, it's hopefully the accounting side of my brain is having this conversation too. I don't want to get too far off, but I don't know

Speaker 6  24:51
you've also looked I mean, I assume Ellis looked at it a bit. I have not looked at it at all. And. It sounds like you've got a decent first lot.

Matthias Miller  25:08
Cool, yeah, I would think. And if nothing else, if we can't speed up those reports, I don't see any reason why we can't have a transaction search that's that's gets us most of what we need. If, for some reason, those reports themselves are too cumbersome or too slow, but, yeah, but once again,

Unknown Speaker  25:25
yeah, yeah, yep.

Speaker 5  25:31
So are we your court? Matthias to take a deeper look at here, or what's the idea? Yeah, this

Matthias Miller  25:36
is, this is in my court to take a deeper look at and see if I can, and this won't be before end of July.

Speaker 5  25:46
So do we want to stick it out to, I don't know, like the 25th we have a meeting that day. That's okay. Okay. We are done with things that are assigned to Joel, and right now, nothing is assigned to you. Joel, no,

Unknown Speaker  26:11
what can we find? Quick?

Speaker 6  26:16
All right, well, thank you all, and I guess I'll plan to see many of you in several hours.

Matthias Miller  26:27
We'll see you at one two and three o'clock.

Unknown Speaker  26:32
Brilliant, all right. Joe Ben, good, right? Thank you. Okay, well, we

Speaker 5  26:42
haven't talked through this for a while. I feel we've had some things surface. We've had some new things get added. So I think we just start at the top and go down. But if you see more tasks, that's why. So should we just start at the top? Alright? So Matthias, we've got Warren, if adding child account with transactions assigned to parents, this was a surfacing task.

Matthias Miller  27:10
And we did, did we agree this one had not been complete? Completed when

Speaker 5  27:14
we looked when you and I looked at it together, we kept it on here for some reason. Okay, modifying Chart of Accounts I can open.

Matthias Miller  27:24
No, it's complete. You can close it out. Okay, perfect, great. So

Speaker 2  27:31
you're saying it does warn now and it it doesn't allow you to do that.

Unknown Speaker  27:36
Um,

Speaker 3  27:37
I think it just warms. If I remember what I ran into?

Speaker 7  27:43
Well, I yeah, I think so, something happens.

Matthias Miller  27:48
Okay, all right, Drew, have you been getting these email errors?

Unknown Speaker  27:54
Um, I got one now.

Speaker 3  28:02
Um, I got one, and it has stuff all the way through the back of the year, and most or through the first of the year, and most of it is stuff that it wasn't showing up in accounting. So I created a new one and reconciled it when we moved on. So I think a bunch of it will just get deleted out to ask more about to do it. But anyway, but yeah, I'm getting them now. Okay,

Speaker 5  28:31
cool. So is this then done? Are we good?

Speaker 3  28:37
Yeah. I mean, you're talking about, like, if there's a wrong, like the GL accounts not mapped, or something like that, like that kind of errors, right?

Unknown Speaker  28:47
Yep, yeah. It's,

Speaker 2  28:49
is it worth something, right to push the accounting and then you get notified.

Matthias Miller  28:56
Okay? So are we going to need to have a way to suppress old errors or something?

Speaker 3  29:01
No, because we're gonna want them to hang out forever in a non functional manner, either, I don't think,

Speaker 1  29:09
right, fair enough. I'll leave it to you. That's good, okay?

Speaker 5  29:15
This one I feel like should be done. It's related to labor intensive buildings, which is closed, just surfaced for some reason,

Matthias Miller  29:30
8914, I was thinking, actually, don't believe it is this is the

Unknown Speaker  29:39
maybe I'm wrong. No, mark this. This is, this is

Matthias Miller  29:52
the ability to recalculate production labor when changing the labor intensive amount. Um. And only allow changing labor intensive amount if the production labor has not been frozen and and or actual costs have not been calculated. So this is locking down labor intensive amounts a bit.

Speaker 2  30:18
So I think it's something and it's we need to do at some point, but I don't, we could probably push it out till September. So what? What do you think? I mean, we've been running with, if I'm understanding correctly, the issue is, when we go to apply actual labor costs right now, we're just assuming all buildings are equal. But on the payroll module, there are certain buildings that we actually pay more because of one or the other set of criteria, and we're not respecting that when we apply actual costs like we should be,

Unknown Speaker  30:57
I think it's well,

Unknown Speaker  31:01
gi Calc. I

Speaker 2  31:05
I think one area is like cottages in or buildings that have installation paneling. In Indiana, they pay their guys more to do that because it takes more time and they just, I don't know, it's just a business decision to pay them more to do that, but when we apply actual costs, we just distribute those that additional payroll to is that not

Matthias Miller  31:29
no, the issue is that's all working. The issue is if somebody says, Oh, we forgot to tell you, we pay the guys an extra 10 100 bucks on this building, and you go into change it, and we've already calculated standard costs, and you change the labor intensive amount, but we've all already calculated standard costs and or we've already applied actual costs. Then changing that doesn't have any function in terms of in terms of accounting, I uh,

Speaker 2  32:04
and what would be what happens currently is, okay, we don't have a way to do what, what happens currently that $200 is just spread out to all buildings, like we actually pay that in wages. So that's captured on the when we look at the how much did we pay in labor, we use that number to apply actual cost. It's just, I would say we can move it to September or so, unless you disagree with bias, no.

Speaker 1  32:36
I mean, I don't have a problem with that whatsoever. It's, yeah, I think we should Bill's call.

Unknown Speaker  32:43
Yeah, let's do that.

Speaker 5  32:49
Okay, so we have September 5,

Speaker 2  32:55
move it to the end of the month. I think we'll have enough other stuff before then.

Speaker 5  33:01
Yeah, okay, sounds good. Okay, another servicing asset management changes for vendor invoices. I just had a note that I'm not sure why it dropped off the list, because it looked like it was on at one point. So

Matthias Miller  33:17
we don't support, no, yeah, we don't support linking assets to line items in vendor invoices. We

Unknown Speaker  33:32
understand what

Matthias Miller  33:34
that like if you go by if you write a vendor invoice to Pine Hill for a trailer. The only specific example I can come up with. And you want to treat it as an asset and tie it to an asset ID, then you would presumably create the vendor invoice. And then if Drew wants to link it to the asset, he has to create a transaction to reverse the vendor invoice and create a new entry for the same same asset account to link it to the asset ID. But there's no way to directly link from a vendor invoice. Here's an expense, here's the asset ID.

Unknown Speaker  34:15
So is this to make so that that can be done?

Unknown Speaker  34:18
Is that what the strategy is?

Speaker 2  34:22
Okay. How does this fit in with we're we're looking to see if we can pull Dwayne in for a period of time to help with some of, like, potentially, some of this type of stuff. So at the end of the year, you imported all the existing assets into the asset management and then that's, that's where Asset Management state all the assets we bought this year. We just said, Well, it's to this asset account, the G. Account, and we just dumped it in there so they're not obviously those items are not depreciating. Yet. What we need to do at some point is somebody needs to go in and say, what are all the like, the asset, the Rolling Rolling stock, what are all the invoices or the transactions charged to this, and then say, Okay, I need to take this and create assets off of this, like, Okay, here's one for a Pine Hill trailer. So I go create an asset for the trailer, and then I find two other invoices for that are also part of that asset, and link those invoices to that, and then set the asset up, enter all the correct criteria for the asset so that it starts depreciating and, you know, expensing to all the right accounts and doing doing what the Asset Management is. So with without prior free, free. This change? Are we? No. The question I have is, should we? Should we hold off on trying to do that

Unknown Speaker  36:14
until is this

Unknown Speaker  36:18
update has been made? I

Speaker 7  36:25
Yeah, well, if you're okay with

Matthias Miller  36:39
would it be cleaner to wait probably, is it strictly, absolutely, 100%

Unknown Speaker  36:48
necessary? No.

Speaker 2  36:52
The only thing we're losing right now with not having the assets set up is it's not depreciating. They basically haven't been put in service in a company, is what, you know, the total balance sheet are correct. And my thought was that once we do this, we will just put them in service as of, you know, today, rather than going, I don't feel like it's worth the energy to go back, you know, 345, months. But I guess the so the question is, how much work is there to make this change? So we kind of know where to prioritize?

Matthias Miller  37:41
Well, let's figure out what means to Okay. I think Josh's idea originally was you would update the transaction itself and just make sure nobody touches the vendor invoice so that asset linking stays around.

Matthias Miller  38:07
I personally don't think that's a satisfactory, long term solution. I think it's I don't think you went I think you want AP to help help with assets. I don't think you want those working around in transactions. So you would need on the assets would never be po items, would they, or would they?

Unknown Speaker  38:28
They could occasionally be.

Unknown Speaker  38:35
Yeah, they could be occasionally I,

Matthias Miller  38:42
so I mean, basically we need to add a column to the PO and non porg would it for the for the asset ID? Do you let people select assets for any we don't try to restrict which accounts you can select assets for. Do we

Speaker 2  39:08
which accounts you're saying when you well, you can, you should, yeah, it should only be the if you go to the balance sheet, whatever the what is the asset account?

Speaker 3  39:27
Like buildings and improvements, I think is the only one that we actually have any

Matthias Miller  39:32
on. Let me see if there's anything on the asset record,

Unknown Speaker  39:34
rolling stock. And

Speaker 3  39:38
yeah, we have assets we like that. You're actually accumulating more invoices too well, I guess original purchase invoices for those basically just fixed assets,

Speaker 2  39:51
or, yeah, anything under fixed assets would be, yeah, you're right. Just just fixed assets are the only one. Ones for you,

Speaker 3  40:02
the ones that it warns you that you're supposed to have something linked to

Matthias Miller  40:07
it. We have validation already that says that you need something linked Yeah,

Speaker 3  40:11
yeah, I ignore that warning. I mean, all the time.

Matthias Miller  40:18
I forgot that we had that. Um,

Speaker 3  40:25
alright, so maybe it would probably be worth our time to go, just turn that off

Matthias Miller  40:32
until the ability to link it training people to ignore that would be, you know, stop training people to ignore that probably would

Speaker 1  40:44
be good. That's the asset class, is the transaction, if,

Unknown Speaker  41:00
if we have a new record,

Matthias Miller  41:09
wait, we have a warning when we so. You said there's a warning if it's missing,

Unknown Speaker  41:17
no, well, it's not linked.

Speaker 2  41:20
You're saying, if you have an invoice that you that you select the GL account of fixed asset, one of the fixed asset account sentences,

Unknown Speaker  41:27
well,

Speaker 3  41:32
transaction warns you now, whether it's on the on the invoice, I don't know.

Matthias Miller  41:38
The invoice doesn't so, yes. So if you have a so for all GL accounts linked to a to a fixed fix asset, then you allow assigning a fixed asset. You warn if it's missing. And then we need to push it all the way through to accounting impact and import it into the transaction.

Unknown Speaker  42:16
It's

Matthias Miller  42:23
I don't think it's, there's a this is Seth doesn't have knowledge about this stuff. This is not highly delegatable.

Unknown Speaker  42:38
Yeah, I don't know if it's, I

Unknown Speaker  42:59
It's probably also not super

Speaker 2  43:01
urgent, but, well, it's not, but in a sense, it it, I'd like to get it, get on it before too long, just because

Unknown Speaker  43:10
we're because we're

Unknown Speaker  43:12
not showing our depreciation expenses,

Speaker 3  43:15
and then the ball of wax just keeps getting bigger, yeah, the sooner we can.

Speaker 2  43:19
I mean, I think it looks something like when we're ready to do it, we don't have to get into that. So I would say, I mean, I would like to get started on it by or so, if possible. So

Unknown Speaker  43:33
let's sit there.

Matthias Miller  43:38
Let's take a look at stuff that we've got my court then and we can

Unknown Speaker  43:44
july 11. What do we want to do?

Unknown Speaker  43:48
Sure? Okay,

Speaker 5  43:51
all right, this rent to own payment rounding error issue that's done okay. Handling, historically, reconciled transactions, shifting reconcile numbers.

Matthias Miller  44:07
I think this is a delegatable

Unknown Speaker  44:11
task. It's a question

Unknown Speaker  44:15
of priority.

Matthias Miller  44:19
The issue is, if somebody goes back and changes a vendor invoice, this goes back to the whole general locking down thing. In particular, if somebody changes a vendor invoice that has already been reconciled, or a check or a deposit or something like that that's already been reconciled, then we will clear the reconciliation, because we rebuild the transaction, and what we would want to have it do instead is just error out and Drew has to go, probably manually sync up whatever needs to change. Um.

Speaker 2  45:02
Can you say error would that then show on Drew's Error Report, which we call it, earlier. It

Unknown Speaker  45:08
would either be Drew's

Matthias Miller  45:14
error report, or it would be, probably more likely. That would be in a nightly email when we try to run the accounting process, that the whole thing probably the whole thing comes to a grinding halt. That would be the Okay.

Speaker 2  45:40
I think that ties in with number two on our list today, but we can cover that.

Unknown Speaker  45:50
Okay,

Unknown Speaker  45:52
are we keeping dates the same and moving on then? Or

Unknown Speaker  45:56
we think, what is the pain level in that group?

Unknown Speaker  45:59
Not super high.

Unknown Speaker  46:06
Put it end of July, okay, for so long, yeah, all

Speaker 5  46:21
right. Add View checks link to vendor invoice done. Okay, great. Quick vendor invoice entry

Matthias Miller  46:30
done. Unless Drew has any

Speaker 3  46:34
Did you do the notes? Thing that was still hanging out somewhere, somehow, I'm not sure how that

Matthias Miller  46:40
where that's at. I think I told Jonathan to do it, or somebody to do it, but let me just

Unknown Speaker  46:49
quick intervender invoices, or

Unknown Speaker  46:53
were we going to do a workaround?

Matthias Miller  46:56
I don't know that we were. I think we're just gonna, yeah, yeah, it's on there.

Speaker 5  47:04
Okay, so we're closed. Great. Add cash flow statements Drew. This was in your court. This was the functional but slow issue last comment, let's see. Oh, no, wait, we did that. That's what we just added to you. From Joel, never mind. We wanted to keep that may 23

Speaker 3  47:29
No, I mean, I don't I mean, what should we do? We'll look at it this afternoon as to how it works. But sort of, uh, I mean, it's basically just give feedback on some time as to whether we should try to improve it or not. Yeah, should

Unknown Speaker  47:47
be moved at the end of July or so. If we should

Speaker 3  47:51
some time to actually utilize it a little bit and see if it's I

Speaker 2  47:54
probably move it out even further, because I don't think we're going to use it a whole lot by then, I probably move it out end of August,

Speaker 3  48:03
as long as we're still waffling on whether our income statements and balance sheets are correct. Why this doesn't just any good anyway.

Speaker 5  48:10
Okay, put it out the end of August. Okay, how about vendor credit memos?

Unknown Speaker  48:21
Um, I think that's,

Speaker 2  48:23
have you gotten notices from AP, which they haven't used any So, okay, wow, we beat that date by. What good 10 days

Unknown Speaker  48:35
we, oh, we're,

Speaker 2  48:37
I get, we're in June, not May. Okay. I

Matthias Miller  48:43
Yeah, Josh still, I think Dwayne The FC, anything is, this is beyond my jurisdiction, but if you guys want to report on credit memos, Josh said he would do it, you guys can coordinate that with him.

Speaker 2  48:56
I think Dwayne, I have it on his list. We talked about it Wednesday. I forgot about it, but I'd say, let's put put it. Put it here. Switch it to Josh. And mean, unless you don't want Josh items on here,

Speaker 5  49:10
I haven't, we haven't been keeping Josh items on here for a while. Now I've got it

Unknown Speaker  49:15
on his list. So okay,

Unknown Speaker  49:19
oh, let me see. How have I been doing? Marking that, Okay, sounds good. Reconcile, export, takes too many pages.

Matthias Miller  49:35
This should be fixed. Drew, I don't know if you had a chance to take

Speaker 3  49:40
a look at it. I haven't, I haven't seen anything different. When was it going to be fixed?

Speaker 5  49:52
See mid, mid June. Jonathan said he adjusted column widths

Speaker 3  49:58
Okay, last week, a week ago. Yep, yeah, they could be, and I just haven't looked at it yet, which, well, yeah, yeah, that's that could easily be, because we've been fighting this Lux guard thing, so I haven't reconciled anything for over a week.

Speaker 1  50:17
Okay? I Yes,

Speaker 5  50:23
okay, keep it at June 1, I moved it to you just to take a look and confirm Drew, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  50:28
hopefully I'll have a chance later this week

Speaker 5  50:34
validate against unlink ledger accounts for vendor invoices.

Speaker 1  50:37
This is done. We set up the account. Okay?

Speaker 5  50:43
Ooh, this was one that I didn't understand. It's an incoming does it belong here?

Matthias Miller  50:49
Yes, it does. Mark, when do you want not to refunds come first. Yeah, things August ish, maybe

Speaker 3  51:09
even further. I mean, like, that whole asset thing should come first.

Unknown Speaker  51:13
I think, yeah, it's due September. Okay?

Unknown Speaker  51:24
That's great stuff they should

Unknown Speaker  51:25
have, but

Speaker 5  51:29
okay, sales order credits and refunds.

Matthias Miller  51:34
This is underway, and I'm I said something like mid July. Um,

Speaker 5  51:46
let's see about the 18th Sure. Okay, streamline vendor invoices needing payment. How

Speaker 5  52:00
much work will be needed to incorporate credit memos into paying invoices, was the last point of discussion. It looks like maybe.

Speaker 3  52:17
Well, I mean that that credit memo part is already incorporated. I'm not sure what else the streamlining it was going to mean. I mean, I think it would have something to do with being able to do your different kinds of payments or something.

Unknown Speaker  52:35
What am I saying There? But isn't intuitive.

Unknown Speaker  52:38
I know how to use it this time. But,

Unknown Speaker  52:40
oh yeah, is that what we're waiting on?

Unknown Speaker  52:46
What were we pushing July? Is

Unknown Speaker  52:52
there anything else further?

Unknown Speaker  52:54
There's no. It starts in mid

Matthias Miller  52:58
something to do with you need to select the payment type for some of the buttons to show up. I think through the noise, the question is, Do you feel any pain? Is the vendor invoices needing payment painful for you at this point, yes or no, and if the answer is no, then we should move on.

Unknown Speaker  53:15
I mean, it's not nearly as painful as much as I

Speaker 1  53:20
that's

Matthias Miller  53:25
a very diplomatic answer. So, so should we bump this out to September or October? I

Unknown Speaker  53:36
would say just, just kick it off.

Unknown Speaker  53:41
You mean completely. Mean complete it

Speaker 3  53:43
or, okay, yeah, just get rid of it. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  53:50
not to do do it.

Unknown Speaker  53:56
Okay, take write offs from source bank accounts.

Matthias Miller  54:01
I mean, can't we close this out in favor of the sales order credits and refunds?

Speaker 2  54:08
No, for me, like same thing that the refunds on sale followers,

Unknown Speaker  54:12
yeah,

Unknown Speaker  54:14
yeah.

Unknown Speaker  54:20
This 190, 907

Matthias Miller  54:23
Yes, actually, hang on just one second though, there's also find ID nine, nine or two. Let me find the one that I'm really using here.

Unknown Speaker  54:33
Okay,

Matthias Miller  54:38
okay, 9902, the one right below it is the one I want to keep. Let's close out. Oh, okay, yes, so let's close out sales, order credits and refunds in favor of this one. This one should be in favor of the 99021.

Speaker 5  54:57
Okay, so hold on. You want to close out. Take write offs from source bank account in favor of sales, order credits and refunds,

Matthias Miller  55:05
no in favor of fees, premiums versus write offs. Okay?

Matthias Miller  55:18
902, okay. And then I want to do the same thing for the one two above that is in progress. Sales will recruit refunds, okay, 9907, I want to close that one in favor of the 9902, as well.

Unknown Speaker  55:40
Oops, yep,

Unknown Speaker  55:43
brilliant. And then the

Matthias Miller  55:52
9902, is in progress with the goal date of mid July, the July, mid July that you chose earlier. Okay? Sure, and by the way, just for fun, that's mostly done just not the accounting impact piece,

Unknown Speaker  56:13
if we

Matthias Miller  56:16
so in the accounting company, if you have a if you have one of these payment types that do not affect the sales order balance, then you need to indicate the source account. And if they are not depositable, then you need to specify the destination account. And so as soon as you've got that, I can tie it into accounting impact and cross your fingers, which should actually be done ahead of schedule.

Speaker 5  56:42
So, okay, about just deleting deposits. Oh, sorry, that was the discussion

Speaker 2  56:47
we just had. Yeah, wow, and we said we'd focus on the write out piece first and then, and

Unknown Speaker  57:00
then get into refunds. Yeah, good.

Matthias Miller  57:07
Let me go take a look at this one. This one's in Jonathan's court. Let me see if it got stranded. 9906 individual review testing. Close. Okay, no, that's

Unknown Speaker  57:20
that one's done. Okay.

Speaker 5  57:27
Oh, this one is in Mark sport, the income statement for pole barn, rev and cogs.

Speaker 2  57:35
So that's in progress. We've started somewhat of a manual progress process for that, I'd say, bump it out to July 25 and then we take a look at it again. Just, okay, great.

Speaker 5  57:57
Okay, we have creative process for moving payments from one sales order to another for Matthias, this

Matthias Miller  58:03
keeps just sliding down the list, and Dwayne hasn't been pounding me for it. I think it would make sense to wait until we do the refunds discussion as well, while we're at it anyway, maybe I'm I don't know Mark or Drew. Do you have input,

Unknown Speaker  58:23
I know I'm good with that

Matthias Miller  58:26
so that, and then that would put it out toward the end of July.

Speaker 5  58:36
Okay, see, how about allow company specific signature adjustments?

Matthias Miller  58:45
We attempted this. It didn't work. We said post the post office is a bigger liability than the signature placement.

Unknown Speaker  58:54
Welcome to the government

Matthias Miller  59:01
versus don't think it's a lot of my I don't think it's a lot of my time. I it could possibly be delegated to Seth. It's probably a little cheaper to send it to Seth, than having me do it, but it's a priorities question in the grand scheme. Well,

Speaker 3  59:27
I would say that just kick it off. I mean, one thing that we could do is that would at least help some would be to go back and have them write new signatures and makes that everybody fits a certain like ratio, you know, like you have to be at least this tall, and it can't be longer than this.

Matthias Miller  59:55
I mean, give them boxes to sign in, but could this. Also just be solved by having a graphic editor resize these and make the images all be exactly the same dimensions and scale everything right? So that

Speaker 3  1:00:10
well, but it's a it's a matter of ratio, like, got it one guy's name is really long and and so if he doesn't write like, next guy's name is short, so you have a really small signature to make the long one the same length as the short one, or else, really large signature.

Speaker 2  1:00:31
Well, could, could it be as simple as Drew? You just print a blank check, or print something like, almost like a blank check. Give it in that box, and you get three signatures, and you upload that, like, what? What keeps us from just doing that?

Speaker 3  1:00:51
Whereas, like, sign on the line, and then we have an editor take the line out afterwards.

Matthias Miller  1:01:00
Or if you can have them, if you can make a green box and sign in black ink or something, that'll make it easier for the editor then, and maybe have the surrounding box, like build this box with your signature, right, right?

Speaker 3  1:01:18
Yeah, that would probably be a cheaper route to take. I mean, editing the signature that they have now is not going to look like their signature, you know, till you get it. You know, the short one stretched and the long one shortened.

Speaker 2  1:01:37
And can you put it in Drew's cart? Or is that? Does that need?

Speaker 3  1:01:44
I mean, it doesn't even have to be on this list. It's not really anything else to do with the class anymore.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:50
That's true. You

Unknown Speaker  1:01:51
upload the images yourself, right?

Speaker 5  1:01:56
I'm just gonna say Drew's taking care of this offline, and

Unknown Speaker  1:02:01
we'll close it out. Okay.

Speaker 5  1:02:08
Next one is for Drew to show ending bank slash credit card balance for pending items. There was a thought. Need some thought and discussion. I

Unknown Speaker  1:02:31
okay ending items

Matthias Miller  1:02:33
when you pay vendor invoices. How does this affect sweeps? How does this affect balance?

Unknown Speaker  1:02:41
You need to think about it.

Speaker 3  1:02:48
It's showing it before payment is made. Like so we have these elected this is what payment would be if I would, if I would pay these, what this balance would be if I would make these payments

Matthias Miller  1:03:03
right? I think that's the goal, yes, but we don't have anything like that. What's the priority of being able to see

Speaker 3  1:03:13
that? I don't know. I mean, right now, like the actual functional need for it doesn't even exist because, because we're not we're not up to date, like we're not completely current with what our bank account balance says anyway, and I don't foresee us being there soon.

Speaker 2  1:03:39
We move it out to November, October.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:46
Yeah, take it off.

Speaker 3  1:03:49
And then once the need for it shows up, say, let's, let's do something like, I mean, because I have a feeling we're going to keep kicking it out, because we're gonna have bigger fires forever, almost than this.

Speaker 4  1:04:00
I Okay,

Speaker 5  1:04:06
how about we defer it, and if it needs to come back around, it'll be there. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:04:20
yep, okay, yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:04:22
do it not to do and then,

Unknown Speaker  1:04:28
okay, Drew's good at making his needs known. Good deal.

Speaker 5  1:04:34
All right, how about speed up general ledger and transaction report? Did we just talk about this? We did? I keep just reading things with that, July 25 that was what we decided. Okay, changes for labor intensive buildings.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:52
We moved that August 1, right? Yeah,

Speaker 5  1:04:56
did I do that and I just set myself up? Or did we have any just. Discussion about this. My last notes are March 13, so we have another

Matthias Miller  1:05:05
this is no we had another labor intensive building conversation. We did. One was lockdown, and then this one is being able to have perhaps multiple. I and have an effective date on the labor intensive amount. That's what it was. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:31
We still need that.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:38
What was the use case of advertisement?

Matthias Miller  1:05:42
Bill? Build on sites or something, so that you could have them, if you know a build on sites coming up, you could have a future, something or other with if it was invoice. I don't know. I'm kind of making this up. I don't know if this is completely right, but you to build on site on Friday. It gets invoiced on Monday, but you they get paid on Friday. So you want the labor intensive building to be effective on Friday so that, I don't

Unknown Speaker  1:06:07
know if it's something like that,

Speaker 2  1:06:09
I'd say, let's close it out or get it off here. I mean, it'll if we actually need it, then we'll bring it back on

Unknown Speaker  1:06:25
okay not to do,

Speaker 5  1:06:32
oh boy, restrict backdating of sales, orders, vendor invoices, checks, deposits. This is out to September 1 at this point. So I don't know if you really want to go through and reprioritize any of these, but you can run through it,

Unknown Speaker  1:06:45
let's let's not.

Matthias Miller  1:06:48
It's out there for reason, and there's some stuff on the agenda for today, and that might change that.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:52
Okay, not me.

Speaker 5  1:06:56
Um, is there anything this filtered balance sheet income statement was out to December 31 it was it was surfacing, though. I think it was just here. Okay, let me see. So we've got a few new ones. Don't mark vendor invoices paid. If check creation failed. Do we need to prioritize

Matthias Miller  1:07:15
a date this is fixed and is going live, and I don't really think drew wants to bother testing it, so I would just do that.

Speaker 3  1:07:29
Yeah, it's always a pain when something didn't work in the task, then you have to go fix everything. It's

Unknown Speaker  1:07:37
obnoxious.

Speaker 5  1:07:40
Vendor, invoice, quick entry. Add line item, notes Drew. Do

Matthias Miller  1:07:44
you want in your court to take a look at or do you just want to take

Speaker 3  1:07:48
my word for it? I'll just take your word for it. I'll be doing it here shortly. So Okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:07:55
close that. All right.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:59
Interest calculator for notes.

Matthias Miller  1:08:02
Y'all happy

Speaker 3  1:08:05
that's on our agenda today, but I don't know that we necessarily unhappy.

Speaker 2  1:08:08
I'm happy with what's doing the Yeah, well, we'll cover it on the agenda. As far as agenda for today, wow, I guess you have updates on that. Matthias, the former employees from payroll.

Matthias Miller  1:08:27
I can delegate. I think this is a question of priority. I can delegate to Seth, he's a natural fit for it. He's gonna love getting back into payroll module. But it's part of the job. Let's look at

Unknown Speaker  1:08:41
it on the agenda, see what unless you under it now,

Unknown Speaker  1:08:45
no

Unknown Speaker  1:08:49
vendor invoices, without expense accounts.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:54
What's the

Matthias Miller  1:08:56
you were getting? This is the weird error. This isn't Mike word. This is a really weird error that he was getting, isn't this a weird save error he was getting?

Speaker 5  1:09:07
Let me see, do I not have anything else in here?

Matthias Miller  1:09:11
There's an email chain.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:12
Oh, here we go. Okay,

Matthias Miller  1:09:19
we don't have oh, I'm planning to push into accounting, but AP won't balance because we don't have any

Matthias Miller  1:09:35
Drew. Do you remember this? Did you clean these up?

Unknown Speaker  1:09:39
Yes, I cleaned those up. They just,

Unknown Speaker  1:09:47
oh, here we go. I

Speaker 3  1:09:49
know at least two of them were not even, yeah, deleted two wrote and wrote in the long po expense. It. Is it possible for them to just ignore and save if it doesn't balance out, like somebody just started writing and their coffee showed up and they forgot and it saved and moved on, I guess?

Matthias Miller  1:10:11
Well, I mean, you're you should be getting an email and error email at some point. Then, um, yeah,

Speaker 3  1:10:19
I need to go more plainly through that, through that report, I just, what I did was I fixed everything that has not been reconciled. So, like the recent stuff, I fixed the other stuff. I didn't even take time to go through because, I mean, think about how I want to deal with it, right?

Matthias Miller  1:10:39
I think we can close this out. This feels to me like the kind of thing that it's more work to chase down to see if we dotted the I's and cross the T's than it is to fix it when if it should, it resurface. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:10:56
sounds good. Transaction by contact report. This

Unknown Speaker  1:11:03
was a

Unknown Speaker  1:11:04
string of emails.

Speaker 5  1:11:12
Let's see this was, was this a one off report that you were thinking about maybe making a potential recurring

Unknown Speaker  1:11:19
report? Is

Unknown Speaker  1:11:20
that what this is?

Matthias Miller  1:11:23
I think this is, I think this is a we weren't sure, but we found out everything's working as it should.

Speaker 2  1:11:32
Okay, was I do know that Ben's been sending me these, the reports he's been sending lately are correct or or so,

Speaker 3  1:11:44
yeah, this might have been related to a we wanted to use it for some specific thing and which wasn't really what it was intended for, or something,

Matthias Miller  1:11:56
okay, I think it was, yeah, that sounds right, and There was some confusion around that.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:02
So do we close it? Are we good with it? Yes, close it. We're good, excellent.

Speaker 5  1:12:08
Oh, great. CF, statement report itself.

Matthias Miller  1:12:18
Hang on, is that the cash flow statement, in which case is there an incident? No, there's a

Speaker 5  1:12:26
there should be incident. It's a PCO. So I don't have probably as easy.

Matthias Miller  1:12:33
This is a duplicate of the, I mean, just literally close it. Okay, it's a duplicate of the cash flow thing that we're talking about today. Okay, great.

Speaker 5  1:12:44
Account Number not appearing, a memo line of check.

Matthias Miller  1:12:51
I explained why it's I defended the current behavior and have not heard of any changes. Mark anything you want changed on that

Speaker 2  1:12:59
not from me? No, I the yeah, good, unless you know of anything Drew. The situation was that the last looked at history and the check did not have the account number, because the account number at that point wasn't added in the vendor record. So,

Unknown Speaker  1:13:20
of course, okay, is

Speaker 5  1:13:22
that? Resolved. Sounds like okay. Issues with adding new reconciliation periods that does have an incident number.

Matthias Miller  1:13:31
This should be fixed. Drew, have you been I don't know if you this one of the things you might want to test. But

Unknown Speaker  1:13:39
was this like long, long time ago,

Unknown Speaker  1:13:43
a little while back, yeah, a few months.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:47
It's been working great the last couple

Unknown Speaker  1:13:51
Oh, yeah. Well, why is it okay? Yeah, that's weird, but we're good, yep, we're

Unknown Speaker  1:13:58
good. All right,

Speaker 5  1:13:59
why that happened. I will investigate it. Tool to update standard costs. This was a discussion for today's item. It's

Matthias Miller  1:14:10
supposed to go live the next update in my court to review. I'm not sure. I don't know if this is going to be if we're doing an update this weekend or next?

Unknown Speaker  1:14:23
Yeah, sounded like he was going to do an update this weekend,

Unknown Speaker  1:14:29
something he was working on.

Speaker 5  1:14:33
Okay, should we just kind of toss it out for next week? I know we're not meeting, but on the list of priorities, okay? Duplicate warning criteria.

Matthias Miller  1:14:45
What's the urgency payment on this one?

Unknown Speaker  1:14:51
Um, not,

Speaker 3  1:14:53
not really high. What's going to happen until we change it is, we're just more likely to have extra stuff. To delete out like we're going to create, we're going to create two of something more often, which can be deleted out at the reconcile. So it's not, it's not huge. It's bigger than, it's bigger than the payment button, selection thing on, put it out. I don't know where you want it to be, but it can be out a little

Speaker 5  1:15:33
bit. We think end of July, end of August.

Matthias Miller  1:15:42
We can put it towards the end of July and just see where it falls in the miscellaneous stuff that's shown up there sounds

Speaker 5  1:15:49
like plan, interest, calculations. Email,

Unknown Speaker  1:15:53
close it out. It's

Unknown Speaker  1:15:56
under this other job. Slow. Email, I mean,

Matthias Miller  1:16:05
drew you got a very cavalier response from me. It's kind of like, well, this normally runs nightly, oh, work around, schedule, task, work around. I think we have an acceptable workaround. Tell us if it continues being painful,

Unknown Speaker  1:16:18
okay. Oh yeah, we'll try it. Oh, okay,

Speaker 3  1:16:27
yeah, I have not, I have not needed to run it yet, so

Speaker 2  1:16:33
he would have run it if had I had that's fair. Is

Speaker 5  1:16:40
this just something you'll bring up again? Drew if you need to, can I close it?

Unknown Speaker  1:16:45
Yeah, go ahead.

Speaker 5  1:16:48
Last one vendor transaction reports. This was an email from Mark. Oh, this was the one make the standard if you plan to keep using it, that's

Matthias Miller  1:17:02
I continue being nervous about all the custom reports that we built out that are not standard, and someday I'm going to want to go delete all my temporary reports that I created for whatever just and

Speaker 5  1:17:21
anyway, Well, should we, what would be the criteria? Should pump this out a month or two and see if it's continuing to be used.

Matthias Miller  1:17:30
I think what we should do is go, I should search my email for some kind of magic string for all reports that I sent to Drew. And we should make a master list. And we should go through it. We should just, we should just rip through those and figure out which one should be standardized and which ones don't.

Speaker 3  1:17:45
Okay. Well, I might already have that magic string. You might be the favorites on my

Speaker 3  1:17:57
I started just favoriting them, and it's, it's about to where I have to go to the More button at the bottom. I should maybe just go through there and make a list of the ones that order, unless there's some way to give the list to you. Can you see how when the latest use was of it something

Matthias Miller  1:18:20
we can look up the latest use. I'm trying

Unknown Speaker  1:18:27
to remember,

Speaker 3  1:18:33
yeah, but there's going to be some stuff that we would use heavily at the end of the year and otherwise. And I don't know if that's quite accurate,

Matthias Miller  1:18:44
I think what, what I would just make me beside myself happy is if you would go through that list and send links, I mean, just Yeah, open up a bajillion tabs and go through and send links to everything that you want to keep, and then we can send that off, and

Unknown Speaker  1:19:04
somebody else can figure out, yeah, can go through the process of

Speaker 2  1:19:09
even want Dwayne to do the same thing with all his custom reports as well. Newton,

Matthias Miller  1:19:17
Dwayne likes to live in the wild west. Us in the county, we don't like that so much.

Speaker 2  1:19:22
He just mentioned to me the other day about the that developers don't like his proliferation of all these music parts,

Speaker 3  1:19:36
duplicates that doesn't even realize he's

Matthias Miller  1:19:41
got my OCD goes just a little bonkers with that. But the good news is he can maintain 90% of them 90% of the time. So, or he can, he can maintain all of them 90% or 95% of the time. So it's Dwayne. He gets a pass. Yeah.

Speaker 5  1:20:03
Well, so Drew, I'm gonna say I'm putting this in your court just to send thanks to Matthias. Do you want to date on it?

Unknown Speaker  1:20:14
Um, do it end of July? Okay,

Speaker 5  1:20:15
sounds good. Okay, we're finally done. That was a long one. I think we're good.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:24
Thank you. Been a while since we've gone through this

Speaker 5  1:20:26
it has, yeah, so I guess that makes sense, probably, but

Speaker 3  1:20:30
we've been able to throw some stuff in the trash. No,

Speaker 5  1:20:33
it's good. I think it'll look nice. I'll clean it up. I'll send everybody a new copy of it here this afternoon, and then we'll be back on track. So, all right, thanks guys, thank you.

Matthias Miller  1:20:48
All right, well, we're getting close to noon.

Matthias Miller  1:20:59
You want to. How much Paso Do you guys want to

Speaker 2  1:21:06
go? We have nothing scheduled. Okay, 1230 or so, like we, I mean, we're good to go till 1230 if we need to. But would you rather pick it up this afternoon? Uh, uh,

Unknown Speaker  1:21:23
could could we? Could we take,

Matthias Miller  1:21:30
I should make a quick phone call. Could we? Could we pause until noon and run from noon to 1212, 3018,

Speaker 1  1:21:38
yeah. Would that work for you guys, for me, yeah, okay, Sounds good. I will see you again. Thank you. Applause.

Speaker 7  1:32:01
that well So I

Unknown Speaker  1:32:42
So where, where do you want to start?

Matthias Miller  1:32:48
Well, is there anything here? Let's do payroll, because that doesn't involve Drew. And this might be kind of a bigger Well, Drew's back, yep. I think I mean, this is delegatable. I don't have an exact price for what it what this would take. I can get one if you want to Seth is already out for a week or two. Do you want me to get it over to him and get an estimate? Or do you just want to have him do it?

Speaker 2  1:33:21
Just Just do it. I mean, okay. Is the okay? What? What's the process currently? Okay. Currently, I'm not sure what, what we do with former employees like to get them off of payroll. Do we just, can we just inactivate them? And everything works, except that they show up on that

Unknown Speaker  1:33:43
full report.

Unknown Speaker  1:33:46
Is that what we have currently?

Matthias Miller  1:33:48
Yes, I believe, I believe, so and so the change here would be to currently. This is maybe getting two in the weeds. But when payroll module says, What is this? Is this person employed? And what is their compensation structure? They're not It's not respecting the in the deactivation date. And so we just need to say they're not employed after after deactivation, same as if they had never been employed.

Speaker 2  1:34:19
And that's why, that why those, some of those employees pop up on, okay? And I think it's only employees with time cars pop up on that report saying a, you know, this guy and this guy don't have a, don't have a time part that, I mean, that's the only thing we would be facing, right, right? Like, are you thinking this is 500 to $1,000 or

Unknown Speaker  1:34:51
let me and I. I would be

Matthias Miller  1:35:11
I don't know that I have enough information to I don't think it would be more than, more than that. What I'd be happy to do is, I think what could make sense is, if you know it's worth up to $1,000 we can just kind of rubber stamp it up to that, if we think it's going to be less than that, or if you'd rather have a more specific personally, I don't think it's super complicated, but I'm not sure there might be some edge cases that Seth might be thinking about that could throw things sideways. And that's a little bit where I'm hedging my

Unknown Speaker  1:35:57
hedging my bets.

Speaker 2  1:35:59
The other thing. I mean, is it worth looking at? Should? Should we instead just take that warning off completely, like part of okay reason, but, oh, the chances okay that that's something that will self correct if you miss paying somebody or adding somebody to payroll, it'll sell. Great. So

Matthias Miller  1:36:25
I don't know. This is a little bit of a, maybe not the most thorough

Unknown Speaker  1:36:37
missing time cards. I

Matthias Miller  1:36:44
can we check contact this? Where are they showing up again?

Speaker 2  1:36:49
It's on one of the let me send you. I've got a report. I need to dig it out. I'll send it email to you and Ben, and then, if you want to you and drew want to start on something else, or

Unknown Speaker  1:37:02
unless you want to just take it, oh, I can find and send it to you anyway.

Unknown Speaker  1:37:09
That's okay.

Matthias Miller  1:37:19
I think there might actually be a simpler Facts.

Unknown Speaker  1:37:37
Okay, we should be getting that email. Okay?

Unknown Speaker  1:37:45
So on the

Matthias Miller  1:37:48
the following employees, so it's on the left, we're not included because you don't have time codes. Okay, here's what. Okay, you're gonna get a little bit of money into into doing this. But into doing this. But what I would propose is, let's go figure out, let me spec out specifically what needs to be done in order to fix this and and then we know what we're getting ourselves into, instead of just turning stuff loose.

Speaker 2  1:38:22
Um, um, but as far as you know, the deactivation is all should all be working directly.

Matthias Miller  1:38:31
I mean, except for the weird reporting stuff, I kind of think so. Okay.

Matthias Miller  1:38:42
All right, so then jumping back to number one, disallow edits and deposit records already reconciled.

Unknown Speaker  1:38:54
Let's see.

Speaker 7  1:39:01
I We had

Unknown Speaker  1:39:11
next to a track rate,

Matthias Miller  1:39:18
friendly way. We did have this job written up as a friendly way, and it was a fairly robust way that could work.

Unknown Speaker  1:39:38
I think we have one job today that kind of touch parts of this. I mean,

Unknown Speaker  1:39:45
like in a

Speaker 2  1:39:49
maybe this is oversimplified, but I think what we would want is anything that's already reconciled, any payment, any payment as part of the deposit that's already been reconciled, or. Or any check payment that we've made, any payment that any money that we have paid to someone that's already been reconciled, we would want to make so that you cannot edit anything on those

Matthias Miller  1:40:18
Okay, so we had, we had also talked about making changes to anything, any record that has a transaction prior to the latest reconciliation date, the latest accounting close date and the latest transaction lock date for affected companies. And then, and if they have the ability to add a historical accounting impact, we have a new permission. And if that case, we would give a warning, but still let them save historical transactions because of records because of the reconciliation date. Yeah. But if you don't have the permission, nobody can say so we're going just one step further than was this reconciled or not to is this prior to a reconciliation date?

Unknown Speaker  1:41:15
Well,

Speaker 3  1:41:17
if it's if it's prior to reconciliation date and not reconciled, then the likelihood of it needing to be edited is actually fairly high, because, right, it probably exists and should not is most likely, or else, There's two that should be combined. Or, you know, so it would be, I think it would probably be better to go just with those that are reconciled for the well, for that part of it. Now, when we look at locking accounting, you know, year end, close, that kind of thing, that changes that story. But

Matthias Miller  1:42:14
do we, if we're going to do this anyway, do we want to go ahead and I do this for all the different record types that could,

Speaker 3  1:42:29
yeah, any record type that could be reconciled.

Matthias Miller  1:42:37
And go ahead and respect the lock dates too. Go ahead mark.

Speaker 2  1:42:43
So the job you've gotten, you've written up here is, is, like a a big, not a bigger job, something that we need to do at some point, right? And it would take care of one plus a whole bunch of other things,

Matthias Miller  1:43:06
correct? It's, this is the full comprehensive solution. Now we could, if we did this, if you put this down into phases, so that they all tie together, we could do something like phase one. Um,

Matthias Miller  1:43:30
and then, when modifying a record, check the accounting impact. Check the accounting check the check for any

Unknown Speaker  1:43:43
live

Matthias Miller  1:43:45
transaction records matching. Actually, this is simpler than this. When modifying a record, no compares saved accounting impact

Speaker 1  1:44:04
against the live accounting impact if it has changed and if the record

Matthias Miller  1:44:13
is linked to any transactions that have a the Record is linked to any transactions that have any reconciled line items. Then warn if the user has permission to edit historical accounting impact error, if the user has permissions

Unknown Speaker  1:44:42
of if the user does have permission.

Matthias Miller  1:44:53
Now, okay, so the big thing I'm saying is I. So what you're saying is we don't really care if we only start, okay, this could be phase one. This can phase if we want to cut scope, then we would change it to

Unknown Speaker  1:45:18
this. I

Matthias Miller  1:45:25
and then phased only enabled this for checks deposits and vendor invoices, so checks, deposits and vendor invoices will become completely locked down in this case. Is that okay for these people?

Speaker 3  1:45:44
Um, it would be nice if, like, they could still change the say, the GL accounts, expense lines on vendor invoices. Like, really, what it needs to lock down is the payment information. But secondarily to that, we can't make additional payments to a vendor invoice, so it kind of needs to lock the whole vendor invoice down as far as total amount. Well,

Matthias Miller  1:46:22
I mean, the moment we say we

Speaker 2  1:46:30
How often is that going to happen? Like could phase one just be only enable us for checks and deposits?

Speaker 3  1:46:40
Well, what's going to be like? Can they change the vendor invoice that has a check you to like it's going to look at the amend or invoice

Matthias Miller  1:46:53
the check. All the check does is adjust AP and meaning, not none.

Matthias Miller  1:47:06
And any you know, non bi expenses on the check. So if you're locked down the check, you can still adjust the the items on the vendor invoice and vendor invoices that are not directly or aren't credit card

Unknown Speaker  1:47:23
will be fine.

Matthias Miller  1:47:29
You can modify without any issue, but if they're tied to a credit card, credit card, then you have to get a little more granular about

Unknown Speaker  1:47:39
locking it down.

Speaker 2  1:47:42
Drew it them pay one. And you can edit it. We say, Oh, we, we missed this item. We under, we shark paid. They increase the amount. And then you go that you aren't able to make a second payment on that.

Speaker 3  1:47:57
Yeah, um, no more. What I'm concerned about in leaving the expense lines editable on the sales order coming on the vendor invoice, is that if it's been reconciled, we can't go back. We can't send a list to AP and say, Actually, these are categorized wrong. Can you re change this category? Yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:48:23
Okay, there's one specific scenario I'm trying to remember exactly when. This is

Unknown Speaker  1:48:28
when

Matthias Miller  1:48:39
that a vendor invoice never hits AP. I came across it when I was working in here.

Unknown Speaker  1:48:51
Oh, is it one that's paid the same day as as the invoice date

Speaker 1  1:49:00
the invoice, po purchase, po purchase. Let me go back to actions, the

Matthias Miller  1:49:07
payments, non po purchases, bypass AP, if they're paid the same day.

Unknown Speaker  1:49:15
Yeah. So

Matthias Miller  1:49:17
I don't know why we did this. I think Josh did this, that we could break this, or we could have a as of date where this behavior changes.

Matthias Miller  1:49:36
But if, if we always used AP, then it's not a problem. You just can't change payment information. Give me a separate transaction

Speaker 3  1:49:51
that would that would work, and then it would give a warning if the if it says paid and the payment amount doesn't match. The total that they want to try to put in this new total, and then they'd get frustrated because they can't change the payment amount, and then they hopefully contact somebody different.

Matthias Miller  1:50:13
What's, what's the pain level? If everything this year that all non po purchases made paid on the date of invoice become unreconciled, and you have to go back and clean them out.

Unknown Speaker  1:50:29
I don't think it would be too high. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:50:34
so if

Speaker 3  1:50:36
and I would be able to make those changes level difference, it just would speak. Just we couldn't give it to them.

Matthias Miller  1:50:48
So I really like that, because then, then, as long as the only accounting impact changes, okay, so, so then, then we do have to get a little bit more nuanced. We do have to break the accounting impact into transactions. There's a account. Okay?

Matthias Miller  1:52:09
Actually, it's easier than this.

Unknown Speaker  1:52:17
Is network.

Unknown Speaker  1:52:22
I which? 72

Unknown Speaker  1:52:27
black, right, T,

Unknown Speaker  1:52:35
78 right. Today,

Unknown Speaker  1:52:56
It shouldn't

Unknown Speaker  1:52:59
this is I struggling. Fine, George,

Unknown Speaker  1:53:50
If we do this,

Matthias Miller  1:54:02
or okay, this gives you the ability to change expense line items. Oh, the other thing we could do, I don't know if you want to do this, but we could have checks push non vi expenses to AP as well, which would give you the same ability, then in checks as well, for one off expenses.

Unknown Speaker  1:54:32
Well,

Speaker 3  1:54:37
I mean, there is so little of that that I'm not sure it's worth it. I mean, I think there's maybe about four on record so far. All right,

Matthias Miller  1:54:52
so what this lets you do then,

Unknown Speaker  1:54:54
is

Matthias Miller  1:54:59
it? All right, I still think this is if you don't care about protecting vendor invoices. Okay, the simple approach is doing it for checks and deposits. But that leaves, leaves a hole with vendor invoices. If we do vendor invoices, and what we need to do is we need to make sure. We need to make sure vendor invoices always hit AP, so we have two separate transactions, and then we need to check for what I think is the simplest way is go find all reconciled transactions for this record, see if, and look at what we expect the accounting impact is, and if there's a change, then we keep you from saving it.

Unknown Speaker  1:56:00
And it's

Matthias Miller  1:56:01
a little bit more complicated to implement. I don't think I can delegate it this to anybody else, but it's pretty robust and and we can pretty easily rule it out to because it works that the logic is so generic we can roll it out to all the different

Speaker 1  1:56:25
400 man record types. Mark, what are your thoughts?

Speaker 2  1:56:39
Do you understand a whole lot better than I do. I mean, are we looking at just doing Phase Two for right now? Yeah, building onto that for phase three. Yeah, yeah. So what is the phase two like? What's the the time frame, the price tag look like? Awesome. Um,

Unknown Speaker  1:57:06
said, I don't know.

Matthias Miller  1:57:23
I'm going to estimate two to 3k but I don't

Unknown Speaker  1:57:34
end up being amateur baseball.

Unknown Speaker  1:57:39
It's not more than that.

Unknown Speaker  1:57:44
It could probably be less than that. We

Unknown Speaker  1:57:51
just need to decide what priority,

Speaker 7  1:57:56
what of turbine box. Well, I think

Speaker 2  1:58:02
we should go through the rest of the projects and then try and circle back and yeah, we're 1230 already. I think we're good to go for a little bit yet, if you are, but

Unknown Speaker  1:58:15
yeah and keep going. Oh yeah, that of threes or not.

Speaker 2  1:58:21
So they Yeah, I guess,

Matthias Miller  1:58:32
yeah. I mean, I do have some things it would be good to chase down early on the day we're getting ready to head out of town tomorrow.

Unknown Speaker  1:58:38
Um,

Matthias Miller  1:58:41
if I could have, I mean, I'd be good at just not dying for sure by 130 Eastern maybe before, kind of see how things pan out for me.

Speaker 6  1:58:58
So over us, when? What kind of planting for 133 Yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:59:06
do you guys? Do you guys? Let's plan on 130 Do you guys want to do earlier? If I'm available earlier or No,

Speaker 2  1:59:12
no, I'd say, let's just plan it for 130 and just go with that.

Speaker 1  1:59:16
Alright, sounds good. Appreciate it.

Unknown Speaker  1:59:19
Thank you. Yep.
