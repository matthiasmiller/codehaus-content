Unknown Speaker  00:35
Matthias

Unknown Speaker  00:55
how's it going? Oh, well, all right, you so

Speaker 1  01:07
Matthias, you're a lot more familiar with the structure. Well, both of you are a lot more familiar with the structure of these calls than I mark.

Unknown Speaker  01:18
Where you want where do we go? Yeah, okay.

Speaker 2  01:24
Mark will be coming shortly. Okay, cool, so, but go ahead. You were just showing us the function, right?

Speaker 1  01:38
I I wasn't completely sure which way you want to go, but I am glad to that's a very reasonable approach.

Speaker 1  01:56
Let's see, is it zch test posting? No

Unknown Speaker  02:07
that I really don't know.

Speaker 3  02:17
Whoops, it's test assist at that. Thank you that posting. Sorry, my audio was getting, getting Okay, excellent.

Unknown Speaker  02:40
All right,

Unknown Speaker  02:45
so I'll start out by

Speaker 3  02:50
telling it to please show us Cash Flow Report and to show us sub pains. Um,

Speaker 1  03:08
okay, accounting, accounting reports, cash flows.

Unknown Speaker  03:13
I have this, um,

Speaker 1  03:21
what? Period should we use for comparison at this point?

Speaker 2  03:27
I don't know. Don't even use Well, I guess if you do cash flow of like May, and then use a previous period of this year, okay?

Unknown Speaker  03:44
Oops, yeah, everyone for

Unknown Speaker  04:06
Oh, that wasn't as bad as it might have been.

Speaker 2  04:09
This is the slow thing, or like this point in it is where it's supposed to be slow. Is that what you're saying? Well,

Speaker 1  04:16
you may not even have caught it because you were not at the keyboard or the mouse, and when I just pulling up that it's actually not bad. So sometimes it can take a bit to to actually load the report itself before it gets to building. And I mean, you know the build that you saw there, spinning through records is not blazingly fast. But okay, so these. Panes that you're looking at are a dump of a lot of information. Here I've clicked on net income the top pane, the lower pane, is an expansion of that into the things that feed these numbers.

Unknown Speaker  05:27
Oh, what fun.

Unknown Speaker  05:33
Okay, so

Speaker 1  05:36
those column widths are not very helpful to start with. But basically we've got net credits and debits for each contributing account here, and total net debits, total net credits for this period and down here, the total net credit for income, which matches this

Unknown Speaker  06:16
episode, one through 430 Okay, I just needed some information. Okay, so I'm so this should match the prior period, number negative, 262, 74.06, which we have there, and if I ran for May, that should match as well with this.

Speaker 1  06:52
I mean, basically there's just a lot of cross checking. Yeah, one thing I will point out that should be helpful in cross checking is that down at the bottom, if the net increase or decrease in cash and equivalence does not match, so this change in cash balances. Okay, I'm forgetting offhand. One of these is calculated from, from what's shown in the report here, a simple summation. The other one goes out to the it goes out and does an independent totaling of changes to cash. And so if those two numbers don't match, I think this one will show up as red, and obviously they'll show up as different numbers. If that's so something's gone wrong somewhere. It may be an account definitions. It may be a bug in the report, but it's something to watch for.

Speaker 1  08:20
So here back on net income, these are the accounts that fed these numbers. If you click on any of those accounts

Speaker 1  08:37
on the right hand side, you get all of the, sorry, I'm moving my video screen out of the way. You get all of the contributing transactions. And you can you probably want to hold down Control and click or middle click with the middle button or something to open it in a new tab if you want to drill into any of those, because you don't Want to have this whole report go away. Right. Right? Okay, so it's broken down by period here,

Speaker 1  09:33
adjustment to net cash from operations. You know, you've got all the mathematical relationships that should be equal to depreciation plus the sum of these and the sum of these and net cash from operations should be equal to this plus this. So. Um, okay, investing activities, I'm pretty sure that is showing a completely wrong number right now, um, and I forget the details I observed, but there's some stuff we need to do to adjust depreciation classifications.

Speaker 1  10:33
Financing, I think we may have some adjustments to make to accounts there as well,

Speaker 2  10:49
well, and I need to go back to those settings and just make sure that the accounts are all going to the right category for the cash flow as well. Yeah.

Speaker 1  10:59
Because, I mean, thus far, you didn't get any feedback on is this actually hitting the way that you wanted to? Let's see this might i

Unknown Speaker  11:28
Okay,

Speaker 1  11:31
we've got a Ford Escape here. Oh, I think this is one thing we want to look at. So we're talking about decrease or increase in property, plant and equipment.

Unknown Speaker  11:50
And we've got these loan accounts, which I What are we counting them as

Speaker 2  12:02
these are not. These are a loan for that piece of equipment. The loan is our asset, not the piece of equipment. Sure.

Unknown Speaker  12:15
Okay, so I

Speaker 1  12:24
we've got the loan here, and we might need to who will apparently, we do need to drill it. Okay, so we were calling the subtype of that fixed asset. I

Speaker 1  12:46
um, my guess is for the I mean, either now I'm not going to change it, but,

Unknown Speaker  13:01
um, what? Let me see.

Unknown Speaker  13:19
Whoops,

Speaker 1  13:22
sorry, off screen, I am opening up a copy that I developed on and made some of these changes i

Speaker 1  14:04
Okay, so there I had changed the subtype to node receivable. I'm not completely sure if that's what you want to do. You could simply override the cash flow category to

Unknown Speaker  14:22
to this

Unknown Speaker  14:29
well, and I guess it is the test system. So let me

Speaker 1  14:42
show you what would happen if we do that. Okay, so that was the BTI 17 Ford Escape, and we've been getting payments on it. Yeah, so the assets been growing, but we actually consider that investing. We're considering those payments as investing in fixed assets,

Unknown Speaker  15:17
which I don't think is how you want to represent

Speaker 2  15:21
that it should be as the payments come in, it should be decreasing.

Unknown Speaker  15:31
Oh, which it is, which it is.

Unknown Speaker  15:36
Yes, my apologies. I

Unknown Speaker  15:45
Okay, but

Speaker 1  15:49
am I thinking correctly that that you would not expect loan payments to be received, loan payments to be showing up in cash flows from investing, uh, decrease in property, plant and equipment.

Speaker 4  16:08
I'm not sure which primary category, but it shouldn't be in that subcategory. Like, what right is that cash flow from investing or from financing? What's it?

Unknown Speaker  16:19
I believe it's from financing. Actually.

Unknown Speaker  16:23
What are investing activities?

Speaker 1  16:25
Investing is basically, and, I mean, you know, you're talking, talking to a finance guy, not an accounting guy, but investing generally. I think of it as you're buying big stuff,

Unknown Speaker  16:46
right? You know?

Unknown Speaker  16:48
Yeah, okay.

Speaker 1  16:51
I think there are some financial transactions that count as investing, but

Speaker 4  17:00
so generally, investing would be an increase when you buy a forklift, you buy a truck, you buy a trailer, and then a decrease at time the sale of the asset. Well,

Speaker 1  17:12
the cash flow is a you have a cash outflow when you buy a truck. Oh, and you have a cash inflow when you sell the truck.

Unknown Speaker  17:25
Thanks. That's need to think about the Cash Flow Statement differently.

Speaker 1  17:31
Yeah, it's you switch directions so many times on these things. That's

Speaker 4  17:38
why Nathan Seager is from game and accounting said at the AF meeting, he said, What did he say? He confidently said, 98 or 95% of the people have no clue how to read a cash flow.

Speaker 1  18:00
So, so, okay, that was the Ford Escape. Let me refresh here. And because I changed the type of that account so that it's note receivable rather than fixed asset, that

Speaker 4  18:14
will give us a new category on the cash flow, right, right,

Speaker 1  18:19
that will show up somewhere in you know what? Actually let me open a new tab so that we can rather than refreshing this one, so we can switch back and forth.

Speaker 1  18:41
Now I can't click away from this row or, I mean, it will refresh other stuff, but,

Unknown Speaker  18:55
okay,

Unknown Speaker  19:01
well, that really

Unknown Speaker  19:08
interesting

Unknown Speaker  19:17
is I need to confirm whether that's actually right. I Yeah,

Speaker 1  19:25
because I would have expected that to to be in financing activities. Let me um,

Speaker 4  19:47
well, there like this example wouldn't be

Unknown Speaker  19:50
it would be like this

Unknown Speaker  19:51
investing activity, okay, at Lara's example. Okay,

Speaker 1  19:57
great, great. So. So you've already seen, well, my real time mental model was wrong, but the report apparently did it right. So, so yeah, we're receiving our note receivable

Unknown Speaker  20:20
decreased.

Speaker 1  20:23
In other words, people paid off the note and were part of it, and they gave us money to do that. And so,

Speaker 2  20:31
so cash position improves, Yep, yeah.

Speaker 4  20:41
And we had an outlay of money to buy a property, plant and equipment of 11,000 which cost us cash.

Unknown Speaker  20:50
That's right now, I think it's worth looking at what some of those things are.

Speaker 3  21:01
Okay? You

Speaker 1  21:07
know what? Oh, okay. These are all loans.

Unknown Speaker  21:13
I feel like there was something,

Unknown Speaker  21:19
buildings and building improvements.

Unknown Speaker  21:26
Okay?

Unknown Speaker  21:30
Now, is that one, right?

Speaker 4  21:33
No, that well, okay. Is that an automatically created depreciation? Because depreciation should not, okay, 1208 is depreciation. So the 1602 did we have what? What is the 16 02 okay,

Speaker 1  21:55
the oh 645, that is the I. I

Speaker 4  22:04
highly doubtful that that's great. That looks like a purchase from Amazon that get posted to, yeah, that that's that's not right, nothing from Amazon from $16

Speaker 1  22:24
it you get to expense 50 cents of this this year. Congratulations.

Unknown Speaker  22:37
Okay, so that part is weird.

Unknown Speaker  22:42
Now the other ones are correct, like the like on four, one the first of the month, they depreciate automatically off of the asset management books.

Speaker 1  22:56
Okay. Now the one question I uh, one thing I do wonder about, though, is I'm surprised to see depreciation showing up here, because depreciation should not be showing up in in the investing section. It should show up backed out up here,

Speaker 4  23:24
well, okay, but down here, the we're looking at accumulated depreciation. So we've got, we've got the assets, the asset value, the initial purchase of an asset, like if you look at the 1207, 110, buildings and billing improvements. You've got that 3790 68 that initial purchase remains there for the life of the asset. The way we all said, that is with our contra account on the accumulated depreciation. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  24:00
so,

Speaker 4  24:02
but, but from a cash flow statement, okay, that would truly be a each month we're decreasing our asset decrease decreases. So what we're saying, Yeah, we paid $3,000 3700 for it. We now think it's only worth 3600 and then 3534

Unknown Speaker  24:28
right? But, but we shouldn't be showing that as investing flows this, let me,

Unknown Speaker  24:38
should this even be on cash flow statement?

Unknown Speaker  24:41
See, I don't think so

Speaker 4  24:45
balance can transact, but it's also showing up, like the depreciation expense, where it's actually expense that's showing up.

Speaker 1  24:54
Yeah, that part should show up, and that should show up as reverse. Just out of as with net we reverse the effects of depreciation on net income.

Speaker 4  25:12
Yeah, you're what you're saying is the depreciation, not the depreciation expense, but the depreciation is we don't even see that on cash flow. The only time we see that is when we buy something or we sell the asset, right?

Speaker 1  25:26
So accumulated depreciation should, should not.

Speaker 4  25:38
That's 12.080, you've got, yeah, okay, 00,

Unknown Speaker  25:41
there we go.

Speaker 4  25:46
Are these settings? Can you Okay, settings on the parent account, and then it defaults all the child accounts beneath that. Or

Unknown Speaker  25:55
I think it generally does. Let me see what I had this set to In in my development system.

Unknown Speaker  26:16
Okay, fixed assets. I'm

Unknown Speaker  26:23
so that's exactly the same.

Unknown Speaker  26:31
Am I thinking about this properly though?

Unknown Speaker  26:39
Okay, okay,

Unknown Speaker  26:52
well, make it too quick to say, okay, here do

Speaker 1  27:05
so with adding depreciation to inventory, you are actually not expensing it at this point. Okay, so should we see an offsetting um?

Unknown Speaker  27:27
Yeah,

Speaker 1  27:29
okay. So 1208 110, buildings and building. Okay. So 10.0 4.10, 7.3, 2.1, dot, 110,

Speaker 1  27:55
I'm puzzled on that one. I

Unknown Speaker  28:13
Let's come back to that. Maybe, if we look at depreciation, that will,

Unknown Speaker  28:20
oh, wait, wait, Wait,

Unknown Speaker  28:26
shouldn't that show up in here?

Unknown Speaker  28:37
That's balanced. I

Unknown Speaker  28:43
No, I don't think it's being expensed here. I mean, let's look at the transactions.

Unknown Speaker  28:49
It should, though.

Unknown Speaker  28:53
Okay, yay.

Speaker 1  29:01
So I think this is the mirror side of the transactions we were looking at, because neither of these is an expense account. Is it

Unknown Speaker  29:18
or is

Unknown Speaker  29:20
this a depreciation and accounts

Speaker 2  29:23
the the 10 is the substitute for expensing it, because it's, we're adding it to our inventory cost.

Speaker 1  29:35
Okay, okay, so it's in your inventory then and then I think, if we look at the one, so I think this is the, these are the transactions that showed up from decrease or increase in property. Land and equipment. They migrated to FGI, and then I think depreciation.

Unknown Speaker  30:14
Yeah,

Speaker 1  30:16
depreciation is where they actually get i Um,

Unknown Speaker  30:25
no,

Unknown Speaker  30:34
oh, I need a diagram, and I

Speaker 4  30:50
Okay, the only, the only depreciation we should, okay, so we have depreciation in multiple places. One is we have been increasing the value of our finished goods inventory we considered an overhead, or it increases every month, like the $100 forklift depreciation increases our inventory because we use that to build our inventory, to add value to inventory that I don't think that that should not show up on the cash flow statement anywhere. I don't think the only depreciation that should show up on Earth is, is the one, are the ones that we post to the income statement, like we have right? Yeah, but we don't have a we don't have one specifically for cost of goods, but we do have, like, it's all hidden within our cost of goods then. But if you go to

Speaker 2  31:52
just one piece of the cost of goods, Oh, yeah. But

Speaker 4  31:56
if you go down to sales or marketing, I think sales and operating expenses, sure, income statement, and you'll see, like, if you okay there, yeah, that one, this one should go, this is for, like, trailers and mules to deliver shits that should be showing on the on the Cash Flow Statement. Then,

Speaker 1  32:18
okay, so the the rolling stock, okay,

Unknown Speaker  32:29
so, so really, that is,

Unknown Speaker  32:36
do these not showing up right now? Okay, so if we check this out

Unknown Speaker  32:44
your account,

Speaker 4  32:51
so when there's nothing selected for the cash flow category, does that mean it's not going to the cash flow category at all, or to the cash flow statement at all.

Speaker 1  32:59
It takes the the cash flow rule of the subset of the subtype,

Unknown Speaker  33:11
okay, and we said that was cogs,

Unknown Speaker  33:20
which we are simply calling and operating expense.

Speaker 1  33:36
Okay, so if for now, I should be back there.

Unknown Speaker  33:46
So since this is cash flow specific

Speaker 1  33:54
um and actually description is irrelevant for if we tag it as depreciation

Unknown Speaker  34:07
Oh, I just hit refresh on this report.

Unknown Speaker  34:16
This report doesn't seem to be near as slow as like some of

Unknown Speaker  34:18
your others, faster than some of them.

Unknown Speaker  34:23
Well, great.

Unknown Speaker  34:26
Internet's a lot better than ours

Speaker 4  34:27
could be. We're not saying it. We're just saying compared to, yeah,

Speaker 1  34:34
okay, was this the rolling stock one? We were? No, that's a different rolling stock. I That's

Unknown Speaker  34:45
interesting.

Unknown Speaker  34:49
This is, yeah, this one, yeah,

Speaker 1  34:56
okay, so that's in the. Expense cogs. I wonder if that's showing up in.

Unknown Speaker  35:09
Oh, look at that.

Unknown Speaker  35:12
Oh, okay. I

Unknown Speaker  35:27
that doesn't seem right.

Unknown Speaker  35:34
I i Okay, well, glitch one,

Speaker 4  36:14
okay, it's the 2719, up above is correct, right? Like, that's what we're showing from that. What's that's what we saw in the income statement, right?

Unknown Speaker  36:25
Yes, I believe

Speaker 4  36:28
it's, but it's not populating down below, right in the sub, right in

Speaker 1  36:32
the diagnostic, right? And we're showing depreciation twice there, which So somehow, I think it's still not recognizing it as, oh yeah, this is a depreciation account. Actually. I

Unknown Speaker  37:04
so I'm not

Speaker 2  37:11
is this working against the subtype setting?

Speaker 1  37:14
That's what I suspect. I guess I could. Should I change that here and see what we get.

Speaker 2  37:26
Well, what's the subtype set for, like, what's the cost of goods? I put a link in the thing. You can see those settings, um, goods, uh,

Speaker 1  37:40
let's see. Oh, okay, in the chat, okay,

Unknown Speaker  37:50
cost of goods,

Unknown Speaker  37:53
operating insurance,

Speaker 1  37:57
and let's see this is the main system, but,

Unknown Speaker  38:01
oh yeah, that's right.

Speaker 1  38:04
So I mean, which is fine. It's just we need to know what the let me change it so I've already got two systems running in here. Okay, so, yes, it's classified as, oh, we can't change that here. Um, let's try.

Speaker 1  38:36
I mean, okay, now that's obviously wrong, though. Um, because cost of good soul generally is not, should not be treated as depreciation,

Unknown Speaker  38:59
but we can at least see if it affects the behavior,

Speaker 3  39:19
there's there's, there's

Unknown Speaker  39:24
something really strange going on.

Speaker 1  39:36
Let me pull up my test system in the other test system and see how it differs.

Speaker 1  39:54
Okay, we had 515 31, 114, 30. So.

Unknown Speaker  40:04
Now.

Speaker 1  40:08
Oh, and this was actually based on data pretty close to the start of May, so

Unknown Speaker  40:16
it's not going to have that much. I'm

Speaker 1  40:27
okay, so there we didn't have that rolling stock account reflected either.

Unknown Speaker  40:37
Sorry.

Unknown Speaker  40:39
Oh, all right, get one in.

Unknown Speaker  40:51
Okay, and for

Speaker 3  40:56
number here, that.

Speaker 1  41:04
All right, so we don't have any of those. No There we had those depreciation transactions showing up or Add to inventory. I

Speaker 1  41:40
Oh, okay, so the first this totaling is a little this total applies to this. I

Unknown Speaker  42:18
there's all sorts of fun here. I'm also seeing this net credit doesn't seem to be reflected.

Speaker 1  42:41
Okay, our notes receivable, at least.

Speaker 1  42:51
Oh, other income that is an interesting one. It's not that it has to be, I that it has to

Unknown Speaker  43:14
be reliability, yeah, okay,

Speaker 1  43:19
so I think a primary weirdness is around appreciation, and I'm disappointed by that,

Speaker 1  43:42
unless I'm missing something and how we unless I was right the First time and wrong now.

Unknown Speaker  43:57
Okay, the rolling stock I

Unknown Speaker  44:06
50.29, right?

Speaker 1  44:21
So as it is initially entered, so,

Speaker 1  44:46
right, okay, so in this state, it is an expense account, and most expense accounts are. Simply shouldn't hit the cash flow statement at all, other than then as summarized in net income. So okay, so here that is, back on net, back on test assist. Okay, good, we've got one piece of sanity now. We said I

Unknown Speaker  45:51
just refreshing

Speaker 3  45:55
to and you could get some in that, what we actually needed, okay,

Speaker 2  46:13
but like, we have adjustments in that cash. We have expenses there just right below depreciation and all that.

Speaker 1  46:20
Yeah, expenses. Expenses should not be showing up at all,

Speaker 2  46:28
but we have, like, sales expense, these different subtypes are are in the cash flow category of operating expense, and I think those should just be eliminated.

Unknown Speaker  46:41
I think you're right.

Unknown Speaker  46:44
And then,

Speaker 2  46:49
well, yeah, because, because the whole income statement should be hitting just on net income, right?

Speaker 1  46:55
With the exception of backing out depreciation, right? Yeah, okay, so I think that is a good diagnosis. So basically, we are we're splitting out nonsensical. We're splitting out expense subtypes, and it's nonsensical to do, so all we want is this line, right, okay, oh, so I wonder if that means

Unknown Speaker  47:36
your cash position probably improves.

Unknown Speaker  47:42
Do cash

Speaker 2  47:44
position if you paid for everything twice. Yeah, yeah. I

Unknown Speaker  47:52
wonder if that was a last minute change, probably a last minute fixed that ended up breaking something. Well, you gentlemen, do not want to watch me try to fix this.

Speaker 2  48:08
Well, it might just be like as all of these are set to that, you know, my we may just need to change the accounting of the cash flow category for each of these to, you know, like, here, not relevant,

Speaker 1  48:27
right? Okay, but so we're saying, Oh sure, sure, although, by default, this report should be throwing out anything that anything that's revenue or expense. I mean, again, other than on that top line, it should be throwing out anything that is revenue or expense, other than specially treating depreciation.

Speaker 1  49:00
Actually, let me pull up the settings, just in case. A quick solution to that first Part pops out. I

Unknown Speaker  49:28
roles and

Speaker 1  49:44
oh, right, so there is some non operating income stuff, but I.

Speaker 1  50:13
No, I definitely should look at that offline without taking up your time. Okay, so spamming expenses onto the operating section of the income statement is a big and somehow not getting that particular rolling stock account. I mean, it reveals something deeper. But the symptom is that that account is not hitting the backing out of depreciation here,

Speaker 1  50:56
if we so marking putting a pin in that these are basically your current accounts, current assets, if they decrease,

Unknown Speaker  51:14
then

Unknown Speaker  51:19
if your current assets other than cash decrease, then that means you have collected money. Yeah, so your cash flow is positive. If your accounts receivable go down,

Speaker 1  51:39
then people paid you if your current liabilities increase, well, then you're you expensed. You expense more stuff than you actually paid cash for. So, wait, did I say if they decreased?

Unknown Speaker  52:06
So if they if Accounts Payable increase? Okay, right? This situation 162,000 it looks like we dropped AP. Accounts Payable was lower by 162,000 is that correct? That we're showing

Speaker 1  52:20
no accounts payable increased by 162

Speaker 2  52:28
because it improved our cash position because we didn't pay the bill, right? More cash, yeah.

Speaker 4  52:38
Okay, credit card, okay. These credit card liabilities is the exact same thing. What is current liabilities?

Unknown Speaker  52:49
Um, that might be those little people

Speaker 4  52:51
and just while the big one is custom deposits. So, yeah, yeah, okay. But what? Okay. What does that mean? Like, if we get, does that mean if we, if we receive a bunch of deposits from customers? Yeah, then our cash position proves Okay, yep. Now receive, not bioshoot. Okay, that works exactly the same as AP, right? Like, should that okay? They're always either,

Speaker 2  53:21
yeah, because they're in one or the other, yeah? So we, that's negative, right? Yeah. So basically we, we got inboxes,

Unknown Speaker  53:35
okay? But at the same, at the moment, the moment, no, received not voucher means we we've received product. We haven't gotten the invoice, but we know we have to pay for it's just

Unknown Speaker  53:55
okay, sure, AP

Speaker 4  53:57
and splitting out accounts payable to

Speaker 1  54:02
two different parts, sure. So, so you have your own, you're recognizing it as AP, AP ish, but, but to get into AP, you need to tie it to an to a bill or something. Is that?

Speaker 4  54:21
Okay, both, both eight. Any change to AP or receive not voucher? No, not. Any change. Some changes, if we receive two by fours, then receive not voucher is affected, as is our raw materials inventory.

Unknown Speaker  54:50
Okay, sure, one is an asset, one's a liability,

Speaker 4  54:52
like on the cash flow statement. Let's assume, yep, both of those were zero at the at the. The beginning of of the month, and then throughout that whole month, we just got $10 worth of two by fours that. So that increased our raw materials inventory, which would be, would that be a negative on the cash flow statement, that's correct, right? And a positive on the received, not voucher, yep. Okay, understand,

Speaker 1  55:34
this is the kind of stuff where I find, you know, I can reach a point of understanding it really well, and that lasts for you know, it varies, but a few minutes to a few hours, right? So obviously, the more time you spend with it, the more the more intuitive it becomes, but

Speaker 1  56:09
so is that? Is that part making sense so far? Yeah, okay, and oh, and, to be clear, which we should actually look at okay, this is received, not voucher.

Unknown Speaker  56:31
Oops, there is only one account.

Speaker 1  56:35
Okay, sure, received, not voucher. Okay, so that's a liability, current, okay, great, great, this is perfect. So that is a current liability. If we look at

Speaker 4  56:57
what, what determines how much, what determines what's group on the cash flow statement. Yeah, we could group, I don't think, I don't know that we want to, but we could through credit card liabilities, accounts payable, and see, if not, vouchered, all into one like, yep, yep. How would we do what? What drives that if we want

Speaker 1  57:19
perfect, perfect question. So what we've got here is, so subtype is current liabilities. We don't have a cash flow category specified on the account, so we look to the subtype and the cash flow category. Is operating current liability,

Unknown Speaker  57:46
okay, so

Speaker 1  57:50
what you see in this section, increase d, you know, in friends, decrease in these are all current liability accounts. They are grouped alphabetically, actually by,

Unknown Speaker  58:19
by the cash flow line description.

Speaker 4  58:23
So if you were to change this one two accounts payable, the two would be combined. That is correct. Okay,

Speaker 2  58:34
well, to basically just give whatever you want to show up together, the same description, name,

Unknown Speaker  58:38
yep, precisely. Great,

Speaker 4  58:45
Wow, this looks like type of thing drew that you could spend days on getting it to work. I mean, yeah,

Speaker 1  58:57
you know, as I was working on implementing it, there were many times where I was like, Well, you know, I happily told Larry that, you know, the concept's pretty simple, and it is. It's just the translation of concept to implementation is not always ultra simple.

Speaker 1  59:27
Okay, so investing activities, I mean, it's, you know, pretty much everything here on an indirect cash flow statement. Again, depreciation being the exception is you spend money. You spend cash to increase your assets, you or if your assets decrease, they generate cash. And you, you gain cash by accruing liabilities, and vice versa. If you pay off liabilities on net, you know you, you use cash. So if you pretty much apply that to every line here,

Unknown Speaker  1:00:32
current year and retained earnings, oh, right, those are

Unknown Speaker  1:00:42
you have a it that

Speaker 2  1:00:46
that's a repeat of the incomes, net income, ah,

Speaker 1  1:00:52
quite possibly. Well, except wait, but what kind of accounts are these?

Speaker 4  1:01:04
Those Shouldn't those should not be listed, okay on the cash flow statement. Do

Speaker 1  1:01:28
so we have them listed as straight up equity accounts. So

Speaker 4  1:01:51
one way to think about a cash flow statement would be, if you're on a cash basis and you depreciate nothing, then your income statement and your cash flow statement would match, right,

Unknown Speaker  1:02:07
right, right, yeah, if you're on a cash basis,

Speaker 2  1:02:15
Yep, yeah, yeah, if you end up the month with more cash, that's How much money you made that month. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:02:21
okay, so now there's an so current year earnings right now, looks exactly the same as owner's equity or retained earnings.

Unknown Speaker  1:02:46
I think that's because we haven't, we had, we didn't enter january 1 balances yet. I

Unknown Speaker  1:02:56
think, sure, yeah, look,

Speaker 1  1:03:01
let's Okay. I've got all this noise over here. Let me close a lot of tabs. Actor just

Unknown Speaker  1:03:20
said was in the full capital.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:29
Okay,

Speaker 4  1:03:30
please. Here's a handful of fgis to reset before you apply. And

Unknown Speaker  1:03:56
yeah, okay, so that didn't make a difference.

Speaker 2  1:04:13
You're saying we went through and found what buildings needed. Gi reset. Thought,

Unknown Speaker  1:04:29
okay, so, um,

Speaker 1  1:04:40
so this is something to think through. How do we differentiate between current year earnings and so here, obviously,

Unknown Speaker  1:04:58
if you. Uh,

Unknown Speaker  1:05:07
right, if we're paying out money, um, on behalf of an owner, then, I mean, that's coming out of our owner's equity accounts or sub accounts,

Speaker 1  1:05:25
and that that one is obviously a legitimate cash flow. I mean a legitimate financing cash flow.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:38
So is it enough?

Speaker 1  1:05:43
If we say, well, okay, for current year earnings, is it enough? If we say, well, current year earnings, we mark it as a temporary equity account and and say, well, we don't show temporary equity accounts, right?

Speaker 2  1:06:03
That's what I would think. Essentially, it's the same number as our as our net income, if you did year to date,

Speaker 3  1:06:15
sure. Right? Right? Okay, so

Unknown Speaker  1:06:24
sure. So we should just, I guess that is a two part solution. We tag it,

Speaker 1  1:06:34
and then we actually okay. So I did change that, but it, it didn't affect things. So we we need to explicitly exclude temporary equity, um, retained earnings. Again, that,

Unknown Speaker  1:07:01
let's see,

Speaker 2  1:07:03
would that be? So the way I think of these is, essentially, it's money being added to or taken away from the business. Yes. So this is the money that the business made last year, being being added to the business? Yeah,

Speaker 1  1:07:25
I think yes. So what we need?

Unknown Speaker  1:07:37
Okay, nothing should be. I

Speaker 1  1:07:52
Okay, so if we decided, hey, it's dividend time, and we wrote Gabriel a giant check that goes beyond, beyond contributed equity and pulls from retained earnings. Then that that one would be a legitimate outflow from retained earnings, right?

Unknown Speaker  1:08:24
So I

Speaker 1  1:08:32
all right, I think maybe this goes to the something. I think I briefly mentioned my epiphany, but that I didn't incorporate it here. I think it means that certain trends that we may want to include retained earnings here,

Speaker 2  1:08:54
but we shouldn't be writing. We shouldn't be writing a cash payment out of like because that should be affecting the other capital accounts. If we pay them a dividend, not retained earnings,

Speaker 1  1:09:17
okay, are you saying you would write them a are you saying that in your accounting each year you would trans, does retained earnings end up at?

Speaker 2  1:09:31
Well, retained earnings should get moved to their capital accounts, you know, at some point. Because basically, it's just saying it's the money we made last year. Now, since they're a partnership, let's, let's give each person his part, okay? And then, if somebody draws, or we do dividends or whatever, it comes out of their their own personal cash. Capital account, the way I'm thinking. But now, if we're an individual, you might go directly out of retained earnings, right? Well, and

Speaker 1  1:10:09
I'm and I was thinking in the other direction of, you know, a public company,

Unknown Speaker  1:10:16
right?

Unknown Speaker  1:10:19
Yeah. So

Speaker 1  1:10:27
now I think we could still cover the bases if we say,

Unknown Speaker  1:10:36
is that right?

Speaker 1  1:10:39
Okay, here's what I was thinking, and I'm not sure if it's right, that in calculating the debits and credits within the period, we so say The debits and credits to retained earnings specifically, or again, any line but Net Income and depreciation,

Unknown Speaker  1:11:10
if we say we're

Speaker 1  1:11:17
excluding I any transaction that refers only to that only adjusts some mixture of temporary and permanent equity accounts.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:50
So

Speaker 1  1:11:54
any transfers between net income and or income summary, you know, whatever or or revenue or expense,

Speaker 1  1:12:09
Any of those would be completely ignored here i i And at this point, I have no idea if that's right.

Speaker 2  1:12:35
I mean, I would guess for our particular application here, if we just ignore it on this if we make it not show up on the Cash Flow Report, is probably going to be correct.

Speaker 1  1:13:01
So I guess the main question then is going to be okay, so you want retained earnings showing up on your balance sheet. So you don't want to mark it as a temporary account. Um,

Unknown Speaker  1:13:34
but most of the time, unless you're actually transacting directly out of that you don't,

Speaker 2  1:13:47
um, yeah, and I don't think we will be, oh, we should, yeah,

Speaker 1  1:13:54
okay, but okay, let's, Let's think about it though. Um,

Unknown Speaker  1:14:00
you know what? Let's help

Speaker 1  1:14:04
the world wide web. Help us a bit. I mean, okay, it seems self evident that generally retained earnings should not

Unknown Speaker  1:14:18
affect things, but,

Unknown Speaker  1:14:28
okay, so that's I

Unknown Speaker  1:14:43
dividends, dividends and.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:07
Okay at the

Unknown Speaker  1:15:12
if we zoom out to a high level,

Unknown Speaker  1:15:22
cash flow occurs whenever,

Unknown Speaker  1:15:33
well cash flow contract income and

Unknown Speaker  1:15:46
Well,

Unknown Speaker  1:15:54
if equity increases, then either non cash assets

Speaker 1  1:16:06
have increased, or cash as assets? Well, okay, there are various possibilities, I suppose, um.

Unknown Speaker  1:16:26
Uh, but when retained earnings changes, um, then that would be either, okay, we posted net income to retained earnings. That's a non cash transaction. We transferred to other capital accounts. That's a non cash transaction. I

Speaker 1  1:17:09
Okay, okay, I'm picking at the edges, but I have this feeling, okay, so do we break the accounting equation in some way if we, If we ignore changes to retain, to earnings, especially,

Unknown Speaker  1:17:42
okay, so I don't think so. Okay, so we're completely,

Speaker 1  1:17:49
if we're dealing with retained earnings, we're completely outside of of the income statement.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:57
So I

Speaker 1  1:18:05
then if we write a big check, so we transfer to someone's capital account, we write a big check.

Speaker 2  1:18:20
Then there's a financing change within their capital,

Speaker 1  1:18:26
okay? So, so we have one transaction

Unknown Speaker  1:18:32
that,

Speaker 1  1:18:36
okay, let's say we take 200,000 from retained earnings, we transfer it to Gabriel. So we debit retained earnings, we credit Gabriel capital,

Unknown Speaker  1:18:55
and then we write a check 450 so within the period the Gabriel capital account, if we look at it, if we include both of those transactions and their effects On the Account, will go up by net 50 so d

Unknown Speaker  1:19:25
now,

Speaker 1  1:19:38
okay, so that if we look at the Change in that account and say, okay, it went up by net 50, therefore we must have a $50,000 cash inflow. That obviously is wrong. But should we do? We just say, okay, so we don't show a retained earnings line. We also x. Completely exclude any transaction that touches both retained earnings and another permanent equity account. So we pretend that that transfer of 200 to Gabriel didn't exist. We see 200 sorry, we see 150 of of debits to Gabriel capital, and we say, ah, we had 150 cash dispersal, cash, decrease.

Speaker 1  1:20:50
Does that letter thing sound right to you? We completely ignore all sides of that, retained earnings to other permanent equity transaction.

Speaker 2  1:21:06
Yeah, that would, that would seem right. It seems weird.

Speaker 1  1:21:15
I mean, the output is what we want, at least in this, yeah.

Speaker 3  1:21:22
I Okay, so,

Speaker 2  1:21:29
but then, like, are there other accounts that way? You know, if we, if we go from one partner to another partner, I mean, which, I don't know why we would, but you know it's going to show. Well, I guess there would show. Would both. Would show up, one as an increase. It was a decrease that zero each other out, right,

Speaker 1  1:22:02
right? That one, yeah, it'd at least be clear what's happening and ended a tie out.

Speaker 2  1:22:13
So it's basically because we are just applying money that's already within the company to the equity line is why we need to do that.

Speaker 1  1:22:31
Is why we need to to do what specifically the ignore the whole transaction it creates in the capital account. Sure, sure. Yes, I think that's right.

Unknown Speaker  1:23:00
Oh, okay, wait a minute.

Speaker 1  1:23:11
Okay, pretty much by definition, for a given period, change in retained earnings is equal to net income minus dividends. I don't know that there's other stuff.

Unknown Speaker  1:23:37
So

Speaker 1  1:23:53
because there's nothing else really that

Speaker 1  1:24:02
can do you remember offhand is other? Does other comprehensive income generally go get accumulated in retained earnings or in another permanent equity account?

Unknown Speaker  1:24:20
And what do you meaning by that income,

Unknown Speaker  1:24:28
weird stuff,

Unknown Speaker  1:24:34
like non operational or

Unknown Speaker  1:24:36
Yes,

Unknown Speaker  1:24:37
like, actually, you know what Goodwill or something like that,

Speaker 1  1:24:44
not operational. So you know what we do, actually already, I think, have, I.

Unknown Speaker  1:25:03
Okay, now,

Speaker 2  1:25:05
well, non operational would hit the income statement as well.

Speaker 1  1:25:09
Okay, yeah, you're right. You're right. Okay, other comprehensive income. Oh, there's an examples. I levels.

Unknown Speaker  1:25:36
Okay, so this sort of stuff,

Unknown Speaker  1:25:41
yeah, yeah,

Speaker 1  1:25:45
stuff that is really completely outside the main course of business.

Unknown Speaker  1:25:57
Look at that.

Speaker 1  1:26:02
I That was my exact question.

Speaker 1  1:26:13
Okay, and my next question was, where does it show up then? And I

Unknown Speaker  1:26:26
Okay,

Speaker 2  1:26:33
on the balance sheet is accumulated other

Unknown Speaker  1:26:37
I see

Speaker 1  1:26:42
so that would be an equity, a permanent equity account,

Unknown Speaker  1:26:48
but it Okay, basically,

Unknown Speaker  1:26:50
it's how we're using it.

Unknown Speaker  1:26:53
Yeah. Oh, okay. Do you have an

Unknown Speaker  1:26:57
accumulated

Speaker 2  1:26:59
No, we don't have an accumulated income on the balance sheet. We would, we would have a non operational income, which is, I mean, it's, well, we don't really deal with things like that for the most part. But, you know, interest on those loans, yeah, loaning out those for those vehicles, like, that's, that's one that hits that and, yep. But the way they're viewing it is, you know, it's, it's, it's your total net at the bottom, but operational net is what we're concerned about. Yeah, yeah. This is below that.

Speaker 1  1:27:43
It's what tells you how your business, how your real business, is doing, right,

Speaker 2  1:27:47
right? Yeah, beings the way we're using it. Then it gets tied into the net income, yeah, we use if we did it like

Speaker 1  1:27:59
this, it would not okay, okay. So basically we are. So the other comprehensive income, it's sort of a red herring. We don't, for your purposes, we don't really care what happens with it, because it's irrelevant. I

Unknown Speaker  1:28:24
so

Unknown Speaker  1:28:29
sorry. I'm just realizing I have been dumping mud on My floor, dried mud, fortunately, um,

Speaker 3  1:28:56
okay, So I

Unknown Speaker  1:29:10
ah,

Unknown Speaker  1:29:18
so I wonder. I

Unknown Speaker  1:29:27
if we have multiple

Unknown Speaker  1:29:38
Okay, so

Unknown Speaker  1:29:43
I think there are several elements, one one approach we could take. And I'm not saying it is, I. Well, it is one of several legitimate ones, I think,

Speaker 1  1:30:07
is to say we, we treat retained earnings as permanent equity. Because, I mean, generally speaking, it is now we do not include in the debits and credits for retained earnings for this period, any any transaction

Unknown Speaker  1:30:39
that I

Speaker 1  1:30:44
uh, well, I guess, as we've already said, we don't include any transaction in the Cash Flow Statement that references one permanent equity and two, some combination of revenue expense or temporary equity.

Speaker 1  1:31:18
So that would mean, okay, let's say we made a million dollars. We posted at the end of the year. We posted that million dollars to, I mean, we accumulated it in a income summary account, or we took it straight to retained earnings. Either way, well income summary and then retained earnings, or straight from revenue and expenses to retained earnings. In either case, we would ignore that change to retained earnings in our in our debits and credits for retained earnings, however, so we got that million dollars retained earnings. Didn't see any change

Unknown Speaker  1:32:27
in the cash flow statement. Then we said, Okay, we're we're allocating 200k to Gabe. So we transfer 200 from retained earnings, a permanent equity account to Gabe capital, a permanent equity account.

Speaker 1  1:33:01
I uh, now there, there are two paths, and both of them, I think we could defend. One is we say, Well, somehow, somehow or other. In the cash flow statement itself, we act as though retained earnings is a is also a temporary equity account. And so we completely ignore that transaction.

Speaker 1  1:33:29
Another option is we say, well, retained earnings is a permanent equity account. And I think this is, I think this is what I would do for

Unknown Speaker  1:33:42
for the general case, it's not what has to happen for you, but, but we say retained earnings is a permanent equity account. We're still throwing out that

Speaker 1  1:33:59
we ignore that initial million, but we say, Oh, well, there's a reduction in retained earnings of 200 that shows up on the cash flow statement as any inflow. There's an increase in Gabe capital of 200 that shows up as an as a cash outflow, which is sort of weird, but, but the two nets to zero cash flow, which is exactly as one would expect, and they reflect as one would generally expect, increases and decreases in permanent equity have corresponding cash flow implications by the Interact method.

Speaker 2  1:34:51
But where's the cash flow that where's the i?

Unknown Speaker  1:35:05
The million dollars.

Speaker 2  1:35:11
Well, that like so if we have an increase to retained earnings?

Unknown Speaker  1:35:21
Well, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:35:24
an increase to retained earnings would

Unknown Speaker  1:35:32
wait.

Speaker 2  1:35:36
So we we move something in to retained earnings, increases that we move it to another, like a capital account, so we have increase and decrease, so that doesn't make any change. So we're still showing that increase as if it's a cash income or outflow,

Unknown Speaker  1:36:03
sorry, which increase the million

Speaker 2  1:36:08
dollars? Right? The original, okay,

Speaker 1  1:36:11
so the million dollars actually came in primarily in the operating income, the operating cash flow segment as net income.

Speaker 1  1:36:31
So it, you know, it hit as revenue minus expense. At some point, let's say we transferred it into retained earnings. So if you look at your balance sheet, you will see your retained earnings there.

Unknown Speaker  1:36:56
But when we're

Speaker 1  1:37:00
when we're creating all of these lines on the cash flow statement, then when we come across a transaction that says that touches temporary accounts and permanent equity,

Unknown Speaker  1:37:18
we throw it out. So you.

Speaker 3  1:37:26
Yeah, well, I

Speaker 2  1:37:47
I mean, I would think we give that a whirl and review the review it then and see if that's making sense.

Speaker 1  1:38:01
That sounds I think that sounds right to me, assuming that you know myself of three hours from now to what my current self is thinking.

Unknown Speaker  1:38:19
Yeah, yeah,

Speaker 1  1:38:23
okay, let me write it down to Okay, throw out from CF statement, any transaction well except net income, any transaction that touches only revenue,

Unknown Speaker  1:38:47
expense,

Speaker 1  1:38:50
temp equity and permanent equity. Do

Unknown Speaker  1:39:04
so

Unknown Speaker  1:39:08
retained impact on retained earnings comes primarily from

Unknown Speaker  1:39:20
net income

Unknown Speaker  1:39:35
at this point, I don't think we will. I

Unknown Speaker  1:39:49
represent the.

Unknown Speaker  1:40:00
Well, okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:40:03
dividends, whether they come from,

Unknown Speaker  1:40:09
well, yeah,

Speaker 1  1:40:12
dividends aren't broken out separately as dividends, but they're they show up clearly as decreases in one permanent equity account or another. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:40:30
so

Speaker 1  1:40:32
if we need to break out dividends onto their own line, I suppose we could think through how to do that, but I think at this point that's not an issue for for you, all right, right, so let's, let's not have You pay to solve that problem right now.

Speaker 1  1:41:01
So transfers among permanent equity accounts, net to zero cash flow. Cool,

Unknown Speaker  1:41:19
cool. So, cool. Okay, so,

Speaker 1  1:41:27
so my to do takeaways are figure out what's up with that, with our handling of depreciation. It's something bogus there. Don't and figure out why we are splaying out various expense categories in the Operating section. I

Unknown Speaker  1:42:06
and then

Unknown Speaker  1:42:10
exclude

Unknown Speaker  1:42:15
temporary equity plus permanent

Unknown Speaker  1:42:23
and that will address both the retained earnings thing and the other, the current year earnings thing.

Speaker 1  1:42:40
I um, well, no, okay, excl, don't show temporary equity accounts on the statement at all. I

Unknown Speaker  1:43:09
I think that's right. Is that

Unknown Speaker  1:43:21
actually right?

Speaker 1  1:43:33
Yeah, because whatever happens there, it presumably has already been it's basically just reflecting revenue and expense, and so

Unknown Speaker  1:43:53
we aren't worrying about it.

Speaker 1  1:43:58
Okay, any pieces I'm missing, or any pieces that you wish we would look at so that you can help you with the rest? Okay? Well,

Speaker 2  1:44:12
mainly, I'll just need to be making sure that we have sub accounts described the same that we want to have show up in the same line, yeah, yeah, and,

Unknown Speaker  1:44:31
oh, those

Speaker 2  1:44:33
notes possibly changing. Well, we could do it individually on the accounts as well. Sorry. Those BTi notes.

Unknown Speaker  1:44:49
Oh yes, yes, yes,

Unknown Speaker  1:44:50
yes, the subtype on those, Yep,

Unknown Speaker  1:44:55
yeah

Speaker 1  1:44:57
and yeah, I think if you if. You scan through here and well, not this section, but everything else, if you make sure the accounts shown are the ones you would expect to be shown in that area, and you know the the balance sheet and income statement connections. I mean, you know, there's the standard flow through the income statement and balance sheet and and so that stuff should tie out. But,
