Unknown Speaker  01:43
So you

Unknown Speaker  01:46
have have I have I double crossed you in some way? Why?

Unknown Speaker  01:52
Because you keep recording our conversations Yes.

Speaker 1  02:05
You know, when people start recording your conversations and saving emails and, and all these kinds of things that usually means that they don't

Unknown Speaker  02:12
trust you anymore. I'm just fighting you.

Matthias Miller  02:16
Yeah, the other thing I've done is I've added my attorney to get the call recordings and the transcripts so that everything falls under client privilege just like Google say, Mary,

Speaker 1  02:27
I think you just got a promotion you'd have gone you're now the attorney. I think you should you should request a doubling of your salary immediately Wow, that got awkward fast

Unknown Speaker  02:52
scary you're the first

Matthias Miller  02:59
first person to ever hope one of my one of my team members negotiate a pay rate while I was on the call.

Unknown Speaker  03:10
Hey, you know, you know,

Speaker 1  03:12
you know the, the Bible story about you know, the guy who sat in the Gates made friends or made friends with all the Yeah, as they were out on the way out so that yeah, there you go.

Matthias Miller  03:26
Be good friends with everybody before you go to Italy

Unknown Speaker  03:34
I'm carrying a bunch of favors, so that I can call them in later.

Unknown Speaker  03:42
All right.

Unknown Speaker  03:45
You do anything, building thing.

Matthias Miller  03:48
I started on it. And then I was like, Hey, I have a better idea of how we could do this. And I was like, Hey, I don't know that I do. So you know.

Speaker 1  04:00
So I declare there's something that Josh does on the somewhere that makes these user profiles work that I don't know about because you had the same problem and you've created this one and I just your online one, and I had the exact same problem when I created a new one as well. So what like where's the magic little button the little switch the I literally went to the user profile. Mm hmm. User Type let me go look in that way Look, looked at the list, the dictionary list or whatever. It's like well, no, it's not there. I was I was hoping for some magic some spot to add something somewhere and no.

Unknown Speaker  04:44
I have no idea.

Speaker 1  04:46
I don't know he'll, they'll get back to me and fix it. Sooner or later. I had this I had this magical idea of creating the brick and mortar user profile and this and I thought Everything was working. Everything was working swimmingly. So I assigned a whole pile of people over to it. And then this morning, they're like, Hey, we can't configure buildings. Well, I mean, you can configure buildings, you just can't You can't move on it like you get that same for one air.

Unknown Speaker  05:19
Well, boy,

Matthias Miller  05:20
oh, fun stuff.

Unknown Speaker  05:23
At least I know how to fix it. So revert changes

Unknown Speaker  05:27
your changes.

Matthias Miller  05:31
Okay, so I'm trying to find your

Speaker 1  05:35
the lat building, did you put it into the online list? We probably should rename that folder as restricted user reports. But anyway, moving on.

Matthias Miller  05:46
Yeah, but that would require

Unknown Speaker  05:51
Okay, so this is lot buildings. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  05:55
And is this all about billings, the current deal for the current dealer.

Speaker 1  06:01
It would be for the dealership that the sales rep is tied to I think when I read through the code, I think that's how the methodology is actually working.

Matthias Miller  06:13
So we're gonna kill the survey killing the hair. Let me share my screen, you can go along for joy rag

Unknown Speaker  06:20
for the dry run. Ever did Nick tell you about my macro scare the other day?

Speaker 1  06:50
So this is this is this is why I'm slightly petrified of messing around with macros. So what was I doing? What was I doing? What was I doing? Oh, I was building out that logistics report that we were looking at. And I wanted to bring in, there's a macro in one of our service reports for the holler portal that brings in source location. And I was like, oh, I want this macro four, to bring in the source location into my report. Well, it's, it's not a global macro. And I see a fancy little button that says make global. And I was like, Well, this is a standard report. I can't do anything anyway. So I was like, what the row I pushed it.

Unknown Speaker  07:33
Well, yeah, it will

Speaker 1  07:34
make it global. The problem is it makes a duplicate macro. And I didn't I didn't know how to make this. So then it like it broke the report. Because now we had a duplicate macro. And I'm like freaking out because I'm like, I just broke the holler portal because I didn't know I did something I thought I couldn't do. And so I'm like, I'm firing off an email to Nick going help, help. That's hilarious. I was like, I was scared. I was like, I didn't know. I knew I probably could delete it. But I'd like Okay, which one? Is it? Now? I'm not sure which one? Which? Which one is it? And I'm like, I don't want to delete the wrong one. And so I'm having a panic attack. And so he thought it was hilarious.

Unknown Speaker  08:19
Oh, it's funny.

Speaker 1  08:23
So, now I have a small petrification about macros.

Matthias Miller  08:28
Oh, you just need to be petrified about making a global that's all?

Speaker 1  08:32
Well, okay. So at some point, I need to figure out how you guys copy macros. And but well, okay, the issue was, I think there was a bunch of macros inside of a macro. And so all of those needed to be duplicated. And then it was just like, I was in a place where I shouldn't be in I was making messes.

Unknown Speaker  08:52
So I have a new philosophy

Unknown Speaker  09:04
What's your new philosophy?

Matthias Miller  09:06
We're going to have a have asked prompts for admins that prompt for sales rep, but it's only going to be visible to admins.

Unknown Speaker  09:13
Oh, I like it.

Unknown Speaker  09:18
So wait, can we?

Speaker 1  09:19
So are you suggesting the code the standard report so that it can be used universally?

Unknown Speaker  09:25
I mean, we could conceivably Yeah.

Speaker 1  09:37
The amount of user reports that are starting to accumulate is becoming slightly concerning. Yeah, I would agree. It's kind of it's like we're living a little dangerously right now. And it's kind of fun.

Matthias Miller  09:53
It's kind of necessary if we want to roll out the sales team but yeah,

Unknown Speaker  10:00
So let's do Marcus which got Boom.

Matthias Miller  10:07
Oh, well let's do

Speaker 1  10:08
you're saying you're saying to admins, you can still see that the drop down so you can still look at it.

Matthias Miller  10:13
Yeah. But then if we go to straight running it as this other because you look at online sales run run with this.

Unknown Speaker  10:22
Well, I don't know that you really want it for online sales you want it for, for the brick and mortar group. There's no value for a online salesperson to have it right.

Unknown Speaker  10:33
No, we don't have live buildings yet. You should you should be impressed

Speaker 1  10:49
with I took out well, first of all, you should be impressed that I figured out how your your two reports actually work together for the for the for the login screen or the home screen. That one took me that one took me a skinny minute to figure out how you were doing that. And to to figure out how to copy it and manipulate it for what I wanted to do. I did it though. I figured it out.

Matthias Miller  11:15
Nice. Do you want to pull it up under your, your brick and mortar user and see if it looks right and it works?

Unknown Speaker  11:23
Oh, did you copied into the list?

Matthias Miller  11:26
Yeah, it's in the list. It's in the it's granted permission. I just want to make sure the Ask prompt

Unknown Speaker  11:33
doesn't show and that it's narrowed down appropriately appropriately.

Unknown Speaker  11:44
All right. Why is it not coming up? Are

Unknown Speaker  11:46
you sure you copied it into the list into

Matthias Miller  11:50
the brick a brick and mortar dealer?

Speaker 1  11:52
No but into the time the report URL into the into the list and to the dictionary list or whatever those lists are called?

Matthias Miller  12:00
You did? Brick and it's called brick and mortar dealer. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  12:04
Okay. It's Oh, yeah. All right.

Speaker 1  12:11
Why not? Why is it not working? Let's go see sales. Well, here hold on a second. Let's let me share my screen so you can see your let me

Matthias Miller  12:18
let me let you share your screen. There you go. Alright, see I still

Speaker 1  12:31
have the list itself. Are you sure you copy?

Matthias Miller  12:35
Oh, yeah, it's number six, but I'll move it up to three. Oh, silly

Unknown Speaker  12:39
me. Oh, I see it. Kaboom. Didn't give me the Ask prompt. Sounds good. I don't have any lock villains assigned to me. So.

Speaker 2  12:52
Yep. Did you rearrange the list? Yep. Refresh. Bingo. Boom,

Unknown Speaker  13:00
buildings. Bingo.

Speaker 1  13:02
I'm assuming it works. Actually, let's do this. Now I'm going to assign myself to a different dealer. There you go.

Unknown Speaker  13:13
Let's go to window window

Unknown Speaker  13:16
window. Where are you?

Unknown Speaker  13:21
Wait, do you know Wendell Hurst when he lived in Colorado? Oh, yeah.

Speaker 1  13:28
You know, you know, I went to school with him. Ah, he and his older brother me and his older brother, brother. We're good friends and school. Ah, I have no idea. This is the funny part. Wendell and my younger brother are about the same age and we're close friends. And the funny part is that window and Chris the data for a while that's the funny part

Matthias Miller  13:59
once you move, move back east he pretty much went dark like Yeah.

Speaker 3  14:05
Anyway. Ah, let's see. Berman's awesome sheds you are no longer going to be a part of let's put you on tripoint Mocksville that we can see real lot buildings

Unknown Speaker  14:17
look at that

Unknown Speaker  14:29
look at at

Speaker 1  14:32
and what can we do with these lot buildings. This gets scary. Oh, I wish I could limit I hope I'm getting small panic attacks at some of this availability that people have now.

Unknown Speaker  14:48
Well,

Unknown Speaker  14:50
the amount of

Speaker 1  14:52
the amount of restrictions I'd like to write and I'm not sure I should write and I'm not sure who should have access to it. I don't know this. This is this is this has spawned quite a uh interesting conversation but I mean it would be really really simple actually to take this report right here and what have it no detail login so it just turns it into a report. Let's do that for

Speaker 3  15:10
right now. Make it make where there's no where there's no details screen push

Unknown Speaker  15:16
you make you do it hold on, but I can do it.

Unknown Speaker  15:22
No no let me do it where did you put this thing?

Matthias Miller  15:27
Do we'll just copy the URL over into your other

Unknown Speaker  15:31
Oh silly me of course. See this is

Matthias Miller  15:35
there's an easy way and then there's the hard way

Speaker 3  15:40
Okay, so All right, let's see it's done

Speaker 1  15:49
just taking off the detail screen action.

Unknown Speaker  15:53
Does that do it you just delete the just delete the button delete the button itself bingo we'll get there cool.

Speaker 1  16:13
Now like yep, and we've got wall textures called I might rearrange this thing a little bit but whatever.

Unknown Speaker  16:20
Interesting. Sweet.

Speaker 3  16:25
here's the here's here's the best part watch this Ctrl C go back over here.

Unknown Speaker  16:33
Price sheets

Speaker 1  16:35
and I really would like to fit well I should I should have tell you how we could push this thing as push the dealer automatically this Do you know how do you know how much time this right here saves me now

Unknown Speaker  16:56
that they can do this themselves?

Unknown Speaker  17:00
Yeah, I What would

Speaker 1  17:01
it take what would it take to push this thing automatically like push the dealer based on the current user I'll find you the report Hold on It's

Unknown Speaker  17:12
if it's easy, it's great. If not

Unknown Speaker  17:17
do a press export

Matthias Miller  17:21
kill the Ask prompt or you already do this visible if yes,

Unknown Speaker  17:26
hold on let me stop sharing I want to see what you're doing duplicate it and put it into the online sales team if you do it it'd be nice if

Speaker 1  17:41
we could just drop it in the stands and automatically it would give the because I want the other one to stay in tax so I can universally do it. Unless you do the fancy universal thing like you just did I'm doing

Matthias Miller  17:49
the fancy universal thing like Leave it

Speaker 1  17:51
leave it right where it's leave it right where it is then

Matthias Miller  17:55
okay. So user is admin asked dealer ask the leader for admin now. So what I like doing is when I die like renaming this so that validation fails

Speaker 2  18:08
well theoretically why does that not error was in look look at dealer field look. Look up dealer field dealer

Matthias Miller  18:32
equals if user is admin sorry, if user is admin then it's to be asked dealer for admin good level of field CRM

Matthias Miller  18:53
actually, we wouldn't even have to do that we

Unknown Speaker  18:55
could

Matthias Miller  19:04
it's easier than that I should have done this in the other place

Speaker 1  19:16
if a particular spot is missing a code IE does not have overhangs then it leaves a dash

Unknown Speaker  19:21
in a blank then we're all good hey, yeah so he You're

Matthias Miller  20:01
now if you refresh your screen on the dealer price expert, you should only have your own dealer.

Unknown Speaker  20:08
it auto fills the dealer

Matthias Miller  20:11
and it auto fills

Unknown Speaker  20:15
diggity dog. I dig it.

Unknown Speaker  20:17
I dig it a lot

Speaker 1  20:22
Oh, that's that is fantastic. That's going to save me soon as Josh fixes the other thing. So here's

Unknown Speaker  20:30
actually I should double

Speaker 1  20:31
check just in case he didn't even tell me yet because he's messaging me about other stuff.

Unknown Speaker  20:36
The other thing we could do is a

Speaker 3  20:48
Nope, still still still still broken.

Matthias Miller  21:43
So now what you can do is you can just use the CRM cockpit available dealers in your dealer list. Boom. Or if you have a sales rep drop list, you can just drop it in CRM cockpit available sales reps, boom,

Unknown Speaker  21:57
done. Wait, how does this work? I have a macro that tells you that

Matthias Miller  22:08
returns the available dealers for the CRM cockpit. So if you're an admin, you get everyone otherwise you just get your current dealer.

Speaker 1  22:14
So that macro so if you do, if you do a dealer, a dealer anytime you do have an ask for dealer, drop that macro in and it's golden.

Matthias Miller  22:25
It's golden.

Unknown Speaker  22:28
How's that for snazzy

Unknown Speaker  22:30
is that it's very snazzy.

Unknown Speaker  22:33
What time do you have to?

Unknown Speaker  22:37
Um,

Unknown Speaker  22:38
we're booked till five, right?

Unknown Speaker  22:40
We're booked till five. So,

Speaker 1  22:44
okay, let's talk. So Gabe, or Gabe hasn't talked to you at all about bringing Calvin on? Yeah. Is that right? I probably need to chase after him and get him to get to get start talking about that. You want zip code list for them? For what reason?

Matthias Miller  23:01
Well, at whatever point we go live, we're going to need a good list for two reasons. We're going to need to know we're online sales get routed.

Unknown Speaker  23:10
If the if the jumping on board with that if the jumping on board with online sales.

Matthias Miller  23:13
True. They're jumping on board with that. Yeah, and but regardless, we need Jonathan really liked the map and the list of zip codes that you gave him previously.

Speaker 3  23:26
Got it? So let's do this. I'm going to share the zip code list for Indiana. Where did I put this thing?

Speaker 1  23:43
I'm sure you're like super? How many different females do you have?

Unknown Speaker  23:46
Um, I have

Speaker 1  23:57
have way too many emails. And there's I have stuff in so many different places. It's getting really unwieldy. I have

Matthias Miller  24:04
only one Google Drive where or Well, one business account or I don't know, store most of my stuff

Speaker 1  24:13
in the port. So hit FYI. This zip code list document which I'm about to share with you is like it's going to have some changes that are going to happen to it sometime soon.

Unknown Speaker  24:25
Oh, you're already shared with it.

Unknown Speaker  24:28
Here Oh. Let's do that. Zip codes.

Unknown Speaker  24:33
Here. Where are you? Where are you where you go.

Speaker 1  24:45
Okay. So there are no they're adding a couple more territories which I'm going to expand further. I don't have Do I have the map Hold on a second. Let me see if I can find the map. So where did

Speaker 3  25:03
I keep that? Let me think okay let me go to my email let me go to send I think to Wayne maybe

Unknown Speaker  25:16
center Wayne

Speaker 3  25:23
Indiana Matt how diggity dog All right. So we download that and then I can give that to you to wait

Speaker 1  25:36
we're gonna we're gonna have all of this prepped and ready to go by the time that they actually say hey we want to do this and you're gonna be like it's already done. What are you talking about?

Matthias Miller  25:46
I'm not doing that they're spending money is

Unknown Speaker  25:51
not that good. You said wait Didn't we talk about

Unknown Speaker  25:56
that like months ago? What what

Unknown Speaker  26:00
downloads Indiana map awesome

Speaker 1  26:13
oh and if I need to, I mean, I can I can do a number of things with that if you need to see something and you know, more clearly zoomed out some whatever I can rework that map.

Matthias Miller  26:34
I don't, I'll see once. Okay, well, I will. Johnson was very eager to very happy to hear we're eager to get started. So

Speaker 1  26:47
yeah, I would I would, maybe, maybe I should just shoot. I don't know. Yeah, if I get a chance. I don't know if I'll get a chance before I go to Italy. But it would be nice if we got that. If you had some information on that soon, I imagine what else did you ask for? You got zip code lists, you got map what you said something else budget stuff. They're gonna go with 11,000 ad spend and underneath truepoint So they're the lower numbers where they want to start out at? Sure. I don't know what they want to do as far as call routings and some of the other stuff that you've been working on as far as the online stuff. That's kind of to be determined.

Unknown Speaker  27:37
Excellence okay you keep you keep

Speaker 1  27:54
putting together sales information. I mean, I need to get every once in a while go and look at what you have what you're building out in the week. You're kind of compiling all that stuff in wiki for them for the online.

Matthias Miller  28:04
Oh, yeah. Guess what? I said he gave Hey, Mike, you want Eric for a day?

Unknown Speaker  28:12
Yeah, we do. And

Matthias Miller  28:16
all I need is there Yes. For a check for how much 4500 for one day, for one day, and includes some audio professional audio capturing so that we can file this away as a as a

Unknown Speaker  28:36
ongoing training resource. When are we doing this?

Unknown Speaker  28:44
I might. Colorado.

Matthias Miller  28:48
Okay, well, for audio reasons. We probably won't be in the same room. But not this not this Saturday, not the following Saturday. But one of the next two Saturdays is what I'm hoping for. Hmm

Unknown Speaker  29:09
you know, my other life was an audio engineer, right.

Unknown Speaker  29:12
Oh, you did? We've never talked about this.

Matthias Miller  29:16
Yeah, we've talked about it last time you were out you were talking about it. And yeah. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  29:29
Okay, wakey wakey wakey wakey wakey wakey wakey. Where

Unknown Speaker  29:31
are you with you Where are you okay. Online Sales Training sales onboarding sales training

Unknown Speaker  29:42
suite

Speaker 1  29:43
at some point. At some point I really really like I guess as we as we start to nail down close rate rate, close method closing methodology. Indiana's gonna be the next one. He's gonna need some help with the closing methodology. I don't know what juice the Ohio people are currently drinking.

Unknown Speaker  30:07
But dude go to go to Sales

Speaker 1  30:08
wallboard sales tab. Sales wallboard was it last week?

Unknown Speaker  30:15
In Ohio? Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  30:22
Look at the top sales guy for last week.

Speaker 2  30:26
Week results 67k For Heath.

Unknown Speaker  30:31
That was one week.

Unknown Speaker  30:32
He did that in one week.

Speaker 1  30:36
I mean, that is by far outside of a outside of a grand opening or some special event. I've never seen a salesperson sell that inside of a week.

Matthias Miller  30:48
Do you know what hours he's working? He

Unknown Speaker  30:53
generally tends to work more than everybody else, I think.

Matthias Miller  30:56
Exactly. Yeah. So here's what I'm here's my hunches.

Speaker 2  31:05
I think evening hours are a big deal. From what I can tell.

Speaker 1  31:10
Yeah, the guys that are the Ohio has pushed a lot heavier for their salespeople to for, to communicate by phone, even after hours.

Unknown Speaker  31:23
And it's like, it seems to

Unknown Speaker  31:25
work. And

Matthias Miller  31:29
we have one interview, we have a semi passive, I don't know, a candidate, everybody else like and I kind of

Unknown Speaker  31:37
put pause on it. And maybe I was wrong, that

Matthias Miller  31:42
I'm keeping an eye in the wing, we have another interview tomorrow. But one of those is hopefully a go. And we'll be able to start doing evening hours. And I'm really, really hoping that getting some of that running, running up until 9pm. Yeah. And hoping that covering those four hours there is going to catch a lot of our cut down on response times. But real, we're already seeing lead response times in less than two minutes, based on some changes that I've made.

Unknown Speaker  32:18
From my sales from from my folks,

Matthias Miller  32:23
which is two minutes from the time the league comes into when it's two minutes from the time it's submitted to when the call is recorded. And so there's supporting progress and 14 second turnaround times within that. So we're working on it. Versus tweaking voicemail messaging to get callbacks and stuff like that.

Unknown Speaker  32:44
Is the auto responder back on.

Matthias Miller  32:46
Oh yeah, it's cranking and we got another lead for Chatham today it's working

Speaker 1  33:02
what is what do you feel like is the hindrance to crack the code from a phone sale? I mean, this if Chatham closes that the second one now that they've pushed out

Matthias Miller  33:13
so there's a few things number one, people are expecting a lot more information people are are confused why they get a phone call after they filled out the quote request. Yeah. So that's where the instant quote thing needs would come in.

Speaker 1  33:26
Hey, riddle me this riddle me this. Yeah, one of the things that Ohio has that we do not have

Speaker 3  33:32
is they asked the question, what is your preferred method of contact? Phone? text email? Which I wonder if it sets a different expectation

Matthias Miller  33:47
I think that's a fantastic question to test Jonathan was winning us Let me run that by Jonathan I like that.

Unknown Speaker  33:58
Okay, you have you have access to type form right?

Matthias Miller  34:02
Yeah, okay, I got everything I need. The biggest thing is he's worried about

Speaker 2  34:06
split testing stuff or like not yeah How would you split test this

Matthias Miller  34:25
Okay, that would be an immediate thing i The main thing is just that we don't make this change and completely Thank you he'll you know, have follow up rates. So

Speaker 1  34:44
let's see, their last question is what is your preferred method of contact? Call text email or other

Unknown Speaker  34:52
which is kind of option for other.

Unknown Speaker  34:55
There is an other option. Yes.

Unknown Speaker  35:01
I mean, carrier pigeon or something

Speaker 1  35:07
we should we should totally put a joke on there like drone, drone, paper paper envelope by drone or something

Unknown Speaker  35:19
missile strike? Like you should we should have some sort of joke like that.

Speaker 1  35:25
But I do wonder, I do wonder if that is a if there is a connection there with kind of setting the expectation that hey, what's your, like their app, they're setting that last expectation on a method of contact that they're being fairly clear that you're gonna we're gonna contact you.

Matthias Miller  35:45
Yep. The other thing I mean, there's other things we toyed with which we haven't gotten to yet playing around with the thank you page. I mean, there's so much stuff to that we could be doing.

Unknown Speaker  36:02
What else?

Matthias Miller  36:08
But I feel like I feel like reaching people is a significant barrier.

Matthias Miller  36:19
But once we get, Daniel was really skittish about turning on texting for them. But at the point that somebody says they want to be text,

Unknown Speaker  36:26
yeah, yeah, it is a it is a so NBS ra meeting

Speaker 1  36:35
the we just had, it became a topic of conversation from the attorney that always speaks. It's no small, it's no small joke.

Unknown Speaker  36:45
I think there was some I think there's

Speaker 1  36:46
some legislation went into place recently on it. And he had the he had the information spot on. So I was actually surprised he caught that. But I do think some of the texting providers are actually like, you have to get explicit authorization from a customer in order to text and marketing information. Now, I don't know about I don't know if there's a dividing line on the sales side, like if they contact you, and they give you their phone number does that expressly indicate the like that you can text them, it may be something that we want to dig into and get some kind of authorization by them filling up the lead form. Maybe maybe we have some sort of like, text below that says by checking this box or by something, something something by providing this phone number, you are authorizing us to contact you with marketing messages by by text message or something like that. Then then you're then you're good to go. If they come through for the lead form, then you can text them all you want if they authorized it. But you have to have explicit authorization and I think actually, if I'm not mistaken, the other piece of that is that you have to have capability for someone to text stop and unsubscribed from whatever you're texting them

Matthias Miller  38:11
which makes me wonder whether three CX and Skype sale is the right. tool set for this but

Speaker 1  38:18
for texting. Yeah. I mean, why don't you just tie a Twilio account directly into I mean, you and you say something about Josh has some sort of SMS tie in? Yeah,

Matthias Miller  38:34
but I'm not sure if I'm gonna use it directly a janky way to text back and forth throughout posting, especially if you when it comes to pictures and stuff, which is what they want to do. I gotcha.

Unknown Speaker  38:55
Um,

Speaker 1  38:57
I mean, I don't I don't have a problem with it. As long as we get the the required authorizations to do so. And then it's like, whatever platform you want to use to do it. I'd say we get it done.

Matthias Miller  39:10
Okay, so get authorization. We'll figure out what that looks like. And then submit we probably have to submit documentation to Sky tail to say, here's the process. Numbers come into the CRM it's only when they check this box that they're that we text them

Speaker 1  39:32
Yeah, I'm a little bit I'm a little bit surprised that like, is he saying sky tail and three CX are throwing big flags? Is that what they're saying? Is he saying

Matthias Miller  39:41
you said his rep was was throwing up some flags and didn't really know much about anything except that we have to tell them exactly what we're texting and stuff like that.

Speaker 1  39:56
I don't know that they have liability in this issue. I think we're the ones who carry the liability.

Unknown Speaker  40:06
He's just being

Speaker 1  40:07
friendly and protective. But I mean, as the liability is on our part, and he is correct, it's like $10,000 per text. It's pretty stiff. But But I mean, you got to have somebody that it's actually going to, you know, so you're for it. And if, if we had a platform that's like, if you can text stop, and it removes them from

Unknown Speaker  40:23
whatever, or or huh.

Speaker 1  40:31
I know, I know, inside of go high level that Ohio's using, there is ways to d&d it a channel of communication. And I don't know if they text back stop or whether it automatically d&d is the channel. But I mean, that would be a particular methodology, maybe that you could do this. Right.

Matthias Miller  40:58
I wonder at what point will be migrating to Salesforce or HubSpot or something. I'm just doing some other integration

Unknown Speaker  41:09
with that rather than our own. Yeah. Maybe not. I'm

Unknown Speaker  41:23
okay. Talk to me about that.

Unknown Speaker  41:26
Well, because you argued against that, I know I did.

Matthias Miller  41:32
The grass is always greener. On the other side. The big thing that we would need is some kind of integration from the CRM that we could

Matthias Miller  41:53
I think we'd do the same thing we do now we'd have a link from within the CRM called Create quote that uses an email address to uniquely identify the customer. And it's a bit messy, but we link stuff up that way.

Unknown Speaker  42:06
Literally, this why do we want to Why do you want to have a tight end?

Matthias Miller  42:11
Because I want to be able to do marketing attribution based on sales. I want to know that this atom on Facebook contributes to actual revenue

Unknown Speaker  42:20
here, but how does that tie to text messages?

Unknown Speaker  42:24
Not to text messages? Text to time?

Speaker 1  42:28
No, I'm specifically talking about text messages. I mean, this I mean, it seems like you're hanging up as you want to have it some way tie in, like texting in some form.

Matthias Miller  42:38
It's the general hand wavy weariness of others, this other thing that we should be doing, and it's harder than it should be. Texting being one of them, it doesn't really have to integrate. It's just like, we need a texting tool that works well. It'd be really nice if it hadn't have stopped capabilities that it would just throw away. You know, keep you from texting people. You shouldn't text. Yeah, but

Speaker 1  43:01
you're not you're Are you considering doing mass Tex Mex message marketing?

Unknown Speaker  43:07
Not yet. No. in the future?

Matthias Miller  43:11
Yeah. Active Campaign has that capability. So yes.

Unknown Speaker  43:16
But for right now, you just want as a form of communication.

Unknown Speaker  43:19
Correct. Google Voice number

Matthias Miller  43:25
and forward calls to the main three CX number. I mean,

Unknown Speaker  43:33
I mean, in theory, you could you're saying if they call that number,

Unknown Speaker  43:37
yeah. Does Google Voice allow you to forward it?

Speaker 1  43:47
I mean, that's that I mean, that's a potential idea. I mean, shoot with a with a free Google account, you get free Google Voice. Make a number and go to town.

Unknown Speaker  44:05
FYI,

Speaker 1  44:06
three CX is three, three CX is apt to do this as Jenkees as probably about as janky as your assists the platform's way of doing it. Probably not. But I mean, it is kind of janky I mean, a Google Voice. It goes right the Google Hangouts or Google Chat or whatever they use.

Unknown Speaker  44:33
Super easy.

Unknown Speaker  44:51
Okay, well,

Unknown Speaker  44:52
tell me tell me, come on. Speak. Speak your mind. You're hung up on something.

Matthias Miller  44:58
He seems really obnoxious. Just that you call a call one number and you get text messages from a different number. But then we can't use Google Voice for voice because we're gonna have automatic Call Recording going into a central location.

Unknown Speaker  45:13
Yeah, but the three CX numbers can be different number anyway. Not

Matthias Miller  45:22
Can you set up call forwarding on Google Voice? Sure, surely you can

Unknown Speaker  45:29
get to my free account,

Unknown Speaker  45:30
my free account.

Matthias Miller  45:33
Use custom call forwarding with Google Voice create a rule custom forwarding or calls to link number

Unknown Speaker  45:43
six you can Okay, fine

Matthias Miller  46:06
Can you do a three three CX custom caller ID

Unknown Speaker  46:20
where can we go?

Matthias Miller  46:35
Yeah, here's what we do. We get them a Google Voice number that is regional to North Carolina. We forward calls to three CX. And then in three CX. We set the call outbound caller ID to their Google Voice number.

Unknown Speaker  46:59
And

Unknown Speaker  47:02
did this thing did this thing? My number?

Speaker 1  47:05
Quit? Okay. I was like, why can I text okay, it quit? I'd they've been Google's been harassing me for how long are saying if you don't use this thing for once, I'm gonna we're gonna cancel it. We're gonna cancel it

Unknown Speaker  47:16
again. So they finally cancelled it.

Unknown Speaker  47:19
Okay, sorry, you were saying?

Matthias Miller  47:21
Okay, so you have they get a new number. That gets shown to the world. It's a Google Voice number. It forwards to three CX. Yeah. And three CX outbound caller ID shows the Google Voice number. Oh, and so to the world, they just look like Google Voice. But they always call from three CX. They call from three CX. They text from Google Voice.

Matthias Miller  47:49
And then all we need is still the authorization so that we don't shell out 10k every text message for people who get angry but you just need to immediately an authorization.

Speaker 1  47:59
Okay. And probably it needs to be more than what's your preferred method of communication. It probably needs to be a little bit more heftier than that. But I'm pretty sure there's boilerplate stuff on that somewhere online.

Unknown Speaker  48:15
Yep. Yep. Um,

Speaker 1  48:20
I know that we're we are full on procrastinating on this logistic stuff. We're not going to talk about this till I get back. So I doubt I doubt you had any any epiphany since our last call?

Matthias Miller  48:35
No. And I think sorry, one of the reasons we're pushing this off is that I've been focused on accounting sales team. I'm not blaming you grafters. No. And I'm like, I think if it's falling outside the scope of the some of this stuff, the sales and marketing stuff, I can definitely justify taking time outside of our normal calls. But I think when it comes to logistics stuff, I want to try to keep that within that time period, because I'm going to make sure stuff gets done.

Speaker 1  49:02
So here's the target. I want to have design and development and implementation happening before spring.

Unknown Speaker  49:14
So we've got some time to

Unknown Speaker  49:16
play with.

Matthias Miller  49:17
Sure. But to that point, we need to we need to account for that in the depth priorities.

Speaker 3  49:25
Yeah, I mean, the big the big difference more than Tuesday's. The thing is, if

Speaker 1  49:33
I do really like the idea that we had last about every building has a type of document tied to it either it's a work order, a sales order, or a quote, which makes life really, really interesting and easier. But I have a fair. My brain says that may that may be some fairly extensive work on Josh's part. Am I right or wrong?

Unknown Speaker  49:59
Oh, I'm quite likely

Speaker 1  50:07
here's, here's the key piece that I want to stick in your brain. And I want you to think about, I don't want to ever schedule

Speaker 3  50:18
items that have financial impact.

Speaker 1  50:23
Okay? I don't want to schedule buildings, I don't want to schedule carports, I don't want to schedule anything that we're going to check accounting, physical goods inventory stuff on, I don't think we should be doing logistics on. Now those items get tied into other documents that we could do logistics on. IE, sales orders, quotes or work orders. That's the I like this working concept.

Unknown Speaker  50:54
But that being said,

Speaker 1  51:01
what I'm kind of hung up on is where do we go from here? How do we is there a way to prove this concept? Like do like what what is a model that we could go look at? To see if we're nuts?

Matthias Miller  51:22
Well, I'm sure even EBMs has some manufacturing plus logistics tie in.

Unknown Speaker  51:30
Logistics tie in on that is all on the sales order.

Unknown Speaker  51:42
Like, for example, you can't

Speaker 1  51:43
go to a metal SKU, or an inventory SKU, and you can't schedule it. It's not that that makes no sense. Which a building

Unknown Speaker  51:54
is an inventory skew.

Unknown Speaker  51:57
Right. And it's bare

Unknown Speaker  51:59
basic form. Now, you could say it's a it's a collection of components. You could say it's a collection of skews, but it's still a skew.

Matthias Miller  52:12
Yeah, I mean, it's just the difference between the finished goods ski versus components skew,

Speaker 1  52:18
right. It's it's it's a manufacturer, it's a manufactured skew,

Matthias Miller  52:22
manufactured skew. No, I mean, the other, so be glad. Well, one thing I would be also willing to do would be, how close are we to saying, Josh, can we make sales orders be the locations or G

Unknown Speaker  53:01
and so when you have a lot billing to deliver, when you have a lot building? Well, I don't know, go ahead. If you had

Speaker 1  53:09
a work order, if instead of it having a sales order or quote it had a work order.

Matthias Miller  53:16
So a work order is like a sales order. Except it's not actually a sale. But a sale sales order can have the same field as a work order.

Speaker 1  53:31
They could all have the same exact same exact fields. Well, not necessarily. I mean, I think that at that point, you could tie in you know, you could you could conditionally bring fields into the detail screen and remove fields from the detail screen conditionally based on what type it is. I imagine it could be unless there's a core record type that we're dealing with here that can't be altered in this way

Speaker 1  54:04
is the sales order a is like a platform record type that cannot be altered

Matthias Miller  54:15
trying to remember what it is in

Speaker 2  54:24
where it is here I don't beliefs really check one other thing

Speaker 1  54:40
the other option I really don't know quite what to do that is is there any validity in going off and doing research and saying, let's go find a software we do web hooks with and just

Unknown Speaker  54:52
get to work

Matthias Miller  54:58
now you're sending like whatever sending like what's the Yeah, yeah. Again, is gonna have to figure out the data model, we just have to figure out the thunking between another system.

Unknown Speaker  55:15
Okay, I know that

Speaker 1  55:18
I got six minutes. I know that a couple months ago, you were brought back into investor tools for some heavy work on some very similar subject about tying up to other platforms or doing it internally. Yeah. It is there anything in that conversation that informs this one?

Matthias Miller  55:41
Yeah. Here's what happens to things. People. Okay. People have biases to build to reuse or make. Yeah, straight up. Yeah, Ohio's probably more of a reuse or in games, more of a more of a maker. Yeah. So that affects the discussion. The challenge investor tools is wanting to get away from was there's two benefits for investors, particularly, this one doesn't apply as much. But you know, they want to eat their own dog food. But second of all, what happens when you're managing a? Well, that's what happens when client services, uses monday.com for their project management, or like, and then there, but they need to integrate with development over here that uses this other system. And you need to make sure the project stains like and what happens when a client services manager leaves? And monday.com, you know, overhears client services with monday.com. And there's no visibility from senior management into I mean, maybe there's maybe there's not into what's going on over there in that corner.

Speaker 1  56:57
So what do you have, you have individuals who were driving and leading platforms that were not integrated? They were linked together. And so therefore, if that individual leaves, you have a logistical nightmare, because that was the person that was kind of driving it.

Matthias Miller  57:16
Correct. Then there's the other story I fanaticism that says, if we only got an off the shelf solution, this problem has been solved before, and we would never have any problems out ever after again. And

Unknown Speaker  57:32
I've heard that a

Matthias Miller  57:33
third of the issue is software, two thirds of the issue is actually business process. Okay, how do you use it?

Speaker 1  57:40
Okay, there's, in my experience, there's two things that happen. With software. One software can drive business practice, or business practice can drive software. And the problem is right now, I don't know that we have either. So we're kind of in this, this no man's land of learning how to do logistics, but never having the the, the experience of using some of the software and informing what we'd like and dislike.

Speaker 3  58:11
Sure. So basically, we're making up our own pitfalls. So go,

Matthias Miller  58:17
go get somebody to sign up for demos. Use one of your lead, leave least use Gmail accounts. And, and your old Google Voice number, and sign up for demos with half a dozen logistics software and have them walk you through it. And ask him questions like, Well, what do most people run into? And what's most reason people switch to you and and what should we look out for when we're looking for logistics software, and they're gonna give you a big laundry list of selling points based on what all of their customers tell them about what their customers think is important to them. And just tell them we're ignorant. We want to know the things to consider when making this type of a decision. Like, there's no reason a salesperson will tell you that it's kind of their job. It's a fair point.

Speaker 1  59:04
The problem is like, logistics, standalone logistics software is like kind of a unicorn because everybody wants to have it tied into something. And so it's oftentimes these pieces that are part of another piece and yeah,

Matthias Miller  59:17
okay, fine, but NetSuite you know, go call it NetSuite and say, we're looking at NetSuite and we just need logistics. But I mean, but we want to consider the whole ecosystem i don't know i don't know what Oracle has their own thing, which is maybe NetSuite is Oracle, sorry. There's few other major

Unknown Speaker  59:39
ERP systems

Speaker 1  59:42
transportation and logistics move your business forward with Cloud financials when I don't look calm financials, I want to logistics just silly people. This is this is why I always my eyes glaze over every time I go and look at something like this.

Matthias Miller  59:58
Yeah, there's a place to find The Enterprise the type language get anything connected to ERP in any form or fashion.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:04
Tell me about it. Okay. All right. I will see you in two weeks.

Matthias Miller  1:00:19
Okay, well have a very fantastic time. And

Unknown Speaker  1:00:25
what is this Software Advice?

Matthias Miller  1:00:28
Oh, here's your here's like a, I have no idea how good this is. You know,

Speaker 2  1:00:32
these things are a dime a dozen. I don't know if any of these really good, but there you go. I beat

Speaker 1  1:00:41
you know, I really should do. I should call our friend Eric and say what do you have? So kindly give me a tour of the shed?

Unknown Speaker  1:00:52
What do you do logistics over here? I'm afraid he'd smell that one coming a mile away.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:01
Yeah.

Speaker 1  1:01:07
All right. I'm going to Italy. And we will think about logistics when we get back. I'll be it. I do think I probably need to start talking loudly about Well, I mean, the design phase of this is probably 90% of the work.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:26
Got it? All right. Cool. Thanks,

Unknown Speaker  1:01:32
man.
