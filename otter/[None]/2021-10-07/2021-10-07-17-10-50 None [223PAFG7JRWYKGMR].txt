The follow up to this morning, one of the major epiphanies is that I've been trying not to drop the ball. And I think one of the things that's holding me back that breaks on it is that I can't move something forward. Unless I know I'm not going to drop the ball. And I've got these things hanging in my inbox where I don't want to drop the ball. And I think if I could get rid of that one thought of, I can't, I can't drop the ball. All of these things. I think there's a lot of pieces that would fall into place that so so what is, you know, what is that? Clearly there's some kind of self protection in that, that ultimately, there's a piece of this that is not fully relying on the Holy Spirit and on other people to carry the weight for what I'm doing. And I think there's this shift of thought in which I have to be okay, not carrying weight. I am not awake carrier, that I am a dispatcher and other people will carry the weight and other people are good at carrying the weight and making sure the father just doesn't get dropped and Holy Spirit will help me in this situation to make sure that that doesn't happen. But in the meantime, there is a Yeah, there's, there's that side of things. The major reason that things stay in my inbox is set so that I don't drop the ball forward.
