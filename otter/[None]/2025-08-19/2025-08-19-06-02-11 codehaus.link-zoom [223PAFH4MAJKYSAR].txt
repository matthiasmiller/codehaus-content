Speaker 1  01:21
Oh, well, that's strange. What's it doing? Okay, not

Speaker 2  01:27
that that should sound better. Does that sound better? There we are. Got a halo behind your head? I know, right there. St Saint Matthias, Yep, that's right

Unknown Speaker  01:42
question for sainthood.

Unknown Speaker  01:55
Man, all right, well, I'm

Unknown Speaker  02:02
gonna see if these are going to switch for me.

Unknown Speaker  02:21
Talk to me, see if that works. You're frozen. That's cool.

Speaker 2  02:32
Test, 123, hello, hello. Is it you or me? I think

Speaker 2  02:42
it was him. Was him. Was it you? Were you frozen?

Unknown Speaker  02:47
He's frozen.

Unknown Speaker  02:49
All right, must be cold out there.

Speaker 3  02:55
Yeah, it is. You're freezing. Uh, uh,

Unknown Speaker  03:15
all right, well, what do you think it is? Sorry, uh, oh, hang on, it killed my chair. Sorry,

Unknown Speaker  03:26
I did. No, no, it didn't

Speaker 3  03:29
Gotcha. What do you think of okay, should this be, should you be able to change the customer on here? Presumably, I

Speaker 2  03:49
uh, presumably, yeah, uh, customer name, account number and contract number would be the three ways that I would expect that you would want to look that up. Look

Unknown Speaker  04:09
that up number we can put in your drop list. We could almost

Speaker 2  04:19
as long as long as the whiskey drop with lists work like the assist, assist drop list, oh, goodness, the platform drop list, where you start searching it and it starts filtering the list, or you start typing it starts filtering the list, right?

Unknown Speaker  04:37
Not sure if it does. I

Unknown Speaker  04:48
uh, let me see the scene,

Speaker 2  04:49
okay, um, let me ask a different question, how? What is the how are you going to get to the customer initially? Well, when you say, take a payment, are you going to be presented with search functions first,

Unknown Speaker  05:09
obviously.

Speaker 3  05:12
I mean, if I think, if you're saying everything was going to be channeled through the Contact Detail screen. And it makes sense that you put to this from the contact basically take payment.

Speaker 2  05:27
So you would go look up your contact and then say, take a payment,

Speaker 3  05:33
right? Although, I mean, if you want to go that route, but you wouldn't. I'm the guy who likes shortcuts, so there's, like, technically, no reason why you couldn't just say, go take a payment. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  05:53
but it

Speaker 2  05:54
kind of makes sense to say, go look up the customer first, and then you're ready to take a payment.

Speaker 3  06:02
Then, if they've got, you know, grouchy notes and things like that,

Unknown Speaker  06:06
right?

Speaker 2  06:10
So this would, this take a payment would never exist outside of a customer. Well, okay, you could have a take a payment URL, which is just a customer lookup, so it is just for the sake of of prompting someone.

Speaker 3  06:33
Do you have an ask, prompted prompts for the customer, and then you directed, redirected his page?

Speaker 2  06:40
No, that's not what I was saying. I was saying that all take a payment URLs would be on the contact record, and you could, you can fake somebody into thinking they're going to take a payment, which is just a customer look up. It's just a regular contact record lookup. Once you get to the contact record, well, there's your take a Payment button that makes it two step, which I'm not terribly in love with, that

Speaker 3  07:18
ends up looking I don't know what it ends up looking like, but it's something along the lines,

Speaker 2  07:30
you know, unless, unless it would be, unless we would do a report that does not auto push into a detail screen. And if you and you would have you would have three options for lookup. It would be the customer name, account number and contract number. This would be inside the platform. And then as soon as you're presented with a list of customers that you're trying to look up, or what we think you're trying to look up the take a payment URL would be in the row, and that would extract out the customer information to push it into the Whiskey. That'd be the other way to do it,

Speaker 2  08:22
because I don't, I like the way that we look up things in the on the platform, like the Ask prompt there, where you, you know, you start typing, it starts filtering. That's super cool. If you can repeat, if you can duplicate that function straight in whiskey, then, which I mean, you're querying back to the database. So that would mean that you're that's your hang up, isn't it? We can even

Unknown Speaker  08:47
do that. That's fine.

Unknown Speaker  08:56
That's fine. It's not a problem.

Speaker 2  08:59
So your drop list, your your your ask prompts, or your drop list, or whatever could be filterable. Yeah.

Speaker 2  09:15
So then the question is, does that? Do those? Do those ask prompts just stay up there at the top and so like, literally, you could look this guy up, take his payment and immediately punch in another set of customer information up top there, and it repopulates the screen with a new customer or or is there, is there a Back and Forth workflow to the to the search information or the search

Unknown Speaker  09:45
input. What's your thoughts?

Unknown Speaker  09:59
Great? From a usability standpoint, all right, here we go, something like this. I think the main thing is that the

Speaker 3  10:20
that just so that you can confirm that you've got the right Bobby. And I don't know what information you need to show it, or need to be added phone number, or are you going to want to be able to search by phone number in here?

Speaker 2  10:35
So here's the other option, if I think we already talked about concatenating the customer name and the contract number together, as in the platform, didn't we, didn't we decide on something like that. So literally, if, if our, if the drop, if the customer drop list filtered based on whatever information you're putting in. So in other words, if you start type if, if they work concatenated Bob Johnson and his account number, if you started inputting his account number, it would also bring would also bring up Bob Johnson, the

Unknown Speaker  11:07
exact same Time.

Unknown Speaker  11:19
Yeah, I mean so you do 341,

Unknown Speaker  11:22
Bill Allen, just say,

Speaker 3  11:27
Look, if you need a phone number look up, then you just, I mean, theoretically, phone numbers in here as well, if you wanted to, but,

Unknown Speaker  11:38
oh, that's a good point. That's a good point being able to look up by,

Speaker 2  11:46
well, okay, pertinent information, the name, the account number, Any contract numbers tied to them, phone number, email address, uh,

Unknown Speaker  12:07
those would be the, those would be the big ones. In order to get to someone. Are

Speaker 2  12:22
you trying to, are you what's, what's your hesitation here? Is it? Is it?

Unknown Speaker  12:26
Well, I think

Speaker 2  12:30
that's that's obnoxious to put that much information in the in a single drop down.

Speaker 3  12:37
So we can, I mean, I'm trying having, we can add search fields. We can run it through your report. It can show a list of contacts for you to select. That's very doable.

Unknown Speaker  12:50
You're you're trying to handle it in one customer drop down.

Unknown Speaker  12:53
We don't have to. So what you're looking for then would be a you need a search customer screen right here, and then it shows you what's the customers

Speaker 2  13:10
but, okay, seriously, Why would, why wouldn't we do that on the platform side, like, why wouldn't? Why wouldn't to take a payment be a, just, literally, a a a report that searches, that searches contacts, yeah, and then it would never push the details. Well, you could push the detail screen if you want to, but in other words, you would have the detail screen link there if you wanted to go into the detail screen. But then also, at the end of the row of information would be take a payment, and you just click the take a payment on the take a payment on the customer that you want, which opens up this whole dashboard. Whiskey whatchamacallit, yeah.

Speaker 2  14:00
And frankly, I probably would just on our search content, search customer, our customers, search customers, report. It would just be a duplicate of that, and we just call it, take a payment, and they basically function exactly the same. It's just, it's just a mental prompt, if someone's going to do, you know, take a payment.

Speaker 3  14:21
Is that fair? Fine by me. So this really becomes so what customer information we want to show up top here?

Speaker 2  14:31
Name Address. Well, if you're just going to show customer information, then it should be just name, address, phone and email is probably what I would have up there, and it's read only. You can't you don't change it. You don't change it. From here, if you want to go back and search a new customer, then you go back and search a new customer.

Speaker 2  14:58
And maybe it is, maybe. It is that we put a URL in the in the whiskey screen that says Search customers, and that would take you back over to the over to the

Unknown Speaker  15:08
to the search report you'll

Speaker 3  15:10
have, yeah, although hopefully by by, by then, you know that you've got the right one and one ready.

Speaker 2  15:19
Yeah, but no, but I'm saying, like it, it like you're taking a whole bunch of payments at one time. So you get done with this guy, and it's like, okay, I want to go. I want to go get my next customer.

Unknown Speaker  15:30
Okay, so something like, like,

Speaker 2  15:37
and actually, actually, okay, riddle me this if we literally had if the customer, if the customer name was a drop list up there, yes, we put a search. We put a link back to the search report. But it's like, if it's naming an account number, and you want to use this as a short thing, if it's literally, you hit the drop and start typing the next account number, boom, and it repopulates. Why not? What? Let's do both. And

Speaker 3  16:02
that's assume that after you process the payment, this screen is going to update to something that says, you know, payment successful.

Speaker 2  16:12
Is that? What's are we going to do that? Or is it reflected in the secondary pain of the history showing the information

Unknown Speaker  16:21
that's fair. But somewhere, or maybe,

Speaker 2  16:23
or maybe it is, you know, it shows a complete screen, or, or, I don't know, I mean, that's, that's fair. I think we ought to do some sort of,

Speaker 3  16:34
maybe there's no reason why you can't say new payment, like, presumably, you want to make sure that after you process the payment, that people don't people don't accidentally go edit this payment, try to edit those payments.

Speaker 2  16:51
So we should, we should. We should blank out a whole bunch of information and say, payment successful and and if it's a credit card transaction, we have to feel we have to show the we have to show the the approval code anyway. So maybe it is we just truncate all the information down to the payment information. I don't know. I

Speaker 3  17:32
Okay, if you come in, if you search through the platform you come in, you see the customer details. You can view the customer out in a DJ screen. Put this in, you run Process Payment. Something should happen at that point. Like, I don't know why, because we said some payment details are still editable value, but something needs to show up. Like, maybe big green letters, successfully. Payment was successfully completed. Maybe even on the same day you have to click a button to make changes.

Speaker 2  18:20
So what happens if you go to, if you go to, oh, you got this over in GitHub. Now, this is not sitting in Claude anymore, is it?

Unknown Speaker  18:29
No, I'm using cursor. If I do,

Speaker 2  18:32
I was, I was like, I was gonna tell you to tell Claude. Okay, let's make a whip up a secondary completed payment screen. We

Speaker 3  18:40
can What do you want it to look like? Well, what do you want it? What do you want to what

Speaker 2  18:47
would you want to see? Okay, if I think instinctively what you would want to see, and I'm going to say this as my opinion, and I imagine some other people might have some other opinions, so it may change, but I would want to see the customer details regarding, you know, name, email, phone number, blah, blah, blah, that's up at the top. Great. And then I would want to break down of what they paid. So, what, what month was like, like, basically, just, yeah, basically a payment breakdown of, you know, completed payment. What the, you know, if there was a credit card, let's, let's field the, let's field, in some way, the approval code. Let's, you know what period was paid, like, basically a mini receipt, or maybe we call it the receipt you

Speaker 2  19:47
uh, that's it. It's a receipt. And literally, literally, this would be something that you could export immediately from there and email it directly to the customer. Or maybe even better yet, even better yet, if there's an email on the account, you could ask the customer, Hey, would you like me to email your receipt? And boom, you just hit email receipt, and it would just fire it. We're in whiskey. We can do that kind of thing, right?

Unknown Speaker  20:22
You? Figure out the template sharing system just

Unknown Speaker  20:38
because we're not in clog, as long we don't have aI anymore?

Speaker 2  20:44
What are you? What you? Are you in? Does GitHub have have

Unknown Speaker  20:48
their own AI? I'm using cursor. It's a medical with

Speaker 2  20:55
you have you have become fully adopted into the AI world. I love it.

Speaker 3  21:03
Way to be. Do you like this payment breakdown while we're waiting for that to code?

Speaker 2  21:11
Um, as long as it defines the periods in the contract that it was paid for? Well,

Speaker 3  21:14
I mean, we have all that up here. You need a secondary breakdown that shows the whole kit and caboodle.

Speaker 2  21:22
I mean, I instinctively, I want to say, to turn it into some print, some friendly looking receipt. I mean, yeah, no, I have a problem with that. Yeah, what you're doing there is fine,

Unknown Speaker  21:38
like this. Do you want to detail lines in here?

Speaker 2  21:41
Look at that payment receipt? Um, yeah. I mean, if it's if we didn't pay that period, then I don't want to show it, but yes, I mean, if it's if we paid that period, then that this has been, this is fantastic. Transaction, transaction date, yep. Authorization code, yep. John Smith, perfect contract. 173 monthly. I love it. Scroll down, breakdown of payment. Amount, pay. Dude, this is great. This is great. And literally, you just hit, if this can be Yep, print, receipt, email receipt, new payment. Dude, that's awesome.

Unknown Speaker  22:34
So stupid.

Speaker 3  22:40
Okay, so then and then, from here Process Payment, you

Speaker 2  22:44
would the only, the only thing that would, the only thing that we would add to this is some branding for whatever RTO company it's pulling from. So if the RTO company has branding, so we, we would add, you know, you probably want to add RTO company information in here as well, like whether that's at the bottom or whether that's, you know, in some way, we need to brand this receipt and identify what company this comes from.

Speaker 2  23:22
Dwayne's awesome RTO company. We need a we need a hold on a second. I'm gonna go ask grock to create

Unknown Speaker  23:33
a logo for this.

Unknown Speaker  23:37
It's dark for short,

Speaker 1  23:41
dark. What

Speaker 2  23:59
since? When does grok asked me to confirm my age.

Unknown Speaker  24:05
Since you're using unhinge, probably

Speaker 2  24:19
okay, grock, you're pretty good. This morning. I'll give you that. I'll give you that. What happened?

Unknown Speaker  24:33
Why aren't you opening

Speaker 2  24:40
here? I'll give you, I'll give you the JPEG for it. I don't love that. Actually, it's good with this one.

Speaker 2  25:03
Here's There you go. There's the Dwayne's awesome RTO company logo lane.

Speaker 3  25:19
It's stereotypical. Maybe that's the funny thing. That's kind of what you would expect to see from them.

Speaker 2  25:28
Speaking of which we should put, put this in the back of your brain. We need a logo field on the RTO company and probably the manufacturer record and the dealer record too. But we'll need, we'll need some logo fields. Right

Speaker 3  26:24
again. So not completely, fully satisfied with your answer, but when you're entering a payment, do you want to see those type of a breakdown for all payments.

Unknown Speaker  26:41
Okay, what's the, what's the collapsing, and then collapsing above

Unknown Speaker  26:47
the collapsing?

Unknown Speaker  26:53
Yeah, so what? Why do we need to? Why do we need the other

Speaker 3  26:55
okay? I mean, if you don't, we don't we just kind of had it originally, and if you don't need it, but then on the receipt you want these detail rows, probably,

Unknown Speaker  27:12
yeah, but you

Speaker 2  27:15
so I would bring back, I would bring back the that, that green breakdown on the receipt. I don't, I don't, I don't need it on the on the payments page, because you have the breakdown up in the collapsible rows, which I really like, by the way. That's except for the font. I'm not sure I'm in love with the font of your letter, of your numbers, but I'm being snickety. Now let's, let's use, let's use my, my quicksand font, just for the heck of

Unknown Speaker  27:40
just fighting.

Speaker 2  27:43
It's branding, you know, we gotta, we gotta use the only, the only font brand,

Unknown Speaker  27:51
which, by the way, how about that? I

Unknown Speaker  28:11
What phone are you? The places we're getting carried away. Oh, whoa. Show me again. I missed it. Nice. That's money, man,

Unknown Speaker  28:24
like, that's,

Speaker 2  28:28
yeah, so I got, I've got, we're these get redone yet, because that's we're still not happy with this. But this is, this is pretty darn close. Some weird stuff on the on the print that I gotta ask Addison about yet. But, yeah, this is money. This. This is gonna, I told you that the design concept, right? So this will sit on the table, right? But by the lettering of the I'm super stoked about this. This is, this can be fun. I'm gonna, I'm gonna have some smart alec that's going to come up to me and go, are you a software company or a ve printing company. Which one you know it? You know, you know some Amish, some Mennonite. Person's gonna have some snarky response.

Unknown Speaker  29:09
Pretend they're all whatever. Did I tell you? Dwayne that Richard Miller's flying out here.

Unknown Speaker  29:18
Richard Miller flying out

Unknown Speaker  29:19
Yeah, we're gonna shoot some sales videos,

Speaker 2  29:24
talking about flying, talking about flying after, probably after. Well, okay, two things. One, we need to talk about faking, how the best way to fake accounting as a part of this system for the for the show, secondarily, after the show, I think I'm going to fly you, and we're going to go to Tennessee, and we're going to sit down with Philip Rudolph, and we're going to deep dive into RTO accounting. You up for you up for the

Unknown Speaker  29:56
How much time do you need? A day you.

Unknown Speaker  30:01
Just be we just go there for the day.

Speaker 3  30:12
You couldn't squeeze it in. You would want to squeeze it in after the expo,

Unknown Speaker  30:17
right? You mean right after the expo, I

Unknown Speaker  30:21
have no idea what life is like right after that. It's not

Unknown Speaker  30:26
that's a possibility. I don't know

Unknown Speaker  30:30
what part of Tennessee it is.

Unknown Speaker  30:35
For Philip. He is in we're gonna be in Knox. But where is he? Good question. I'd have to go figure out exactly where he's at.

Speaker 2  30:49
That's actually a thought. I'll talk to Philip. So you're thinking, go from the expo and then, or just see if we can block out a day with him, you know, sitting in some conference room somewhere during the expo, or right after the expo.

Speaker 3  31:03
That's during we can do about half a day after, between then and when I had to fly out. When

Unknown Speaker  31:12
are you when are you flying back?

Speaker 3  31:13
Playing play out like the late ish Thursday, I might be able to get a later play. I here's the thing, would I do my mind? No, I feel bad leaving my life for about third time in two months. Yeah, kind of,

Speaker 2  31:35
well, the other, the other option is I see if Philip wants to fly to Colorado, and I fly him to Colorado. Now that might actually

Speaker 2  31:54
be, if I, if I could, if I could wave a magic wand, I would put three people and us in a room together. It would be PD, Weaver, Phillip Rudolph and chase Venable. I put all three, I put all of us in the same room, and we would figure out accounting that would get awfully expensive for me, and it would be probably awkward for, you know, to have three different RTO companies represented to talk about independent RTO companies accounting that could be interesting. But anyway, dark Dwayne's like, what's dark

Speaker 3  32:28
Dwayne's awesome. Martino, it's dark. Man.

Unknown Speaker  32:40
Okay,

Speaker 3  32:49
all right, so here's what we got. Are we? Are we? Are we keeping this filter or not? So if you all right, boom, and see.

Speaker 2  33:00
So, like, literally, if you're on this customer's account, then you could, you could be like, Oh, I'm in the wrong customer account. Hit the drop down and and go to the to the to the right person. Okay, the question then is the moment you take a payment and you get to your payment receipt, look, at that, the dark company, the dark RTO company. So in, you know what, you know what?

Unknown Speaker  33:32
Yeah, let's,

Speaker 2  33:34
it's almost useless. It's almost useless. Yeah,

Speaker 2  33:43
oh, by the way, do we? Shall we get push nickity about colors?

Speaker 3  33:49
No, Jonathan, that's not, that's not a good use of my time. Okay, got it with Jonathan sometime.

Speaker 2  33:55
Yeah, yeah. I mean, the drop list at the top, I feel like is almost useless. It would. I think there's more value and giving in giving a search customer URL at the top, right back to the back the report. Because here's the thing, if you got here, and I don't know, it just it feels, it feels useless. Okay,

Speaker 2  34:25
and the new payment on the receipt page, the new payment at the bottom, will do what will take you where?

Speaker 3  34:33
I mean, it'll just take you back to the silver link to do a search for a customer

Unknown Speaker  34:39
fair enough, and if edit

Speaker 3  34:41
would take you back right in the screen where you couldn't change the payment details, but you could change how it was allocated at least that day, or unless you have admin privileges.

Speaker 2  34:54
So you're saying the dollar value could not change. But. But you could rejigger the

Speaker 3  35:02
if you process the payment for 2541, you can't change the dollar value, but you can say, well, actually, I don't want to. I want to, can I? I don't know why.

Speaker 2  35:21
Okay, go back. Does your edit payment? Take you back there. So drop the period open, so we have the does this thing actually calculate? Okay, so the 2451 is the amount that we paid. So theoretically, you could say, in this period, actually,

Unknown Speaker  35:41
you can say, I want to, I want to, you

Speaker 2  35:48
want to, you want to go. The processing fee is dropped to zero, and you're actually going to pay the full $5 of the

Unknown Speaker  35:58
Yeah, you can, how

Speaker 2  35:59
are you going to validate that it that it matches,

Unknown Speaker  36:05
you won't be able to continue. I mean, I don't know. Just validation, I don't know.

Unknown Speaker  36:14
So

Speaker 2  36:16
if we're going to give this kind of an option to go back and rejigger it, then I think we need to think we need to think critically through how that rejiggering works, so that it becomes intuitive. Because part of me, part of me, wants to say, if you go and change a box, the other boxes that are editable light up red until you resolve it back to green.

Speaker 3  36:37
Well, do we even want to allow it means we need some method of technology for doing it, right?

Speaker 2  36:45
Okay, so this all gets stored on the payments RG, on the contract record. I'm going to call it that. I don't know if that's what we're calling

Speaker 3  36:55
but am I correct? There is a separate payments record that basically says we got this cash, I think, and then each respective contract has an RD that says this much of that payment that we got got applied to this contract for these purposes.

Speaker 2  37:15
So I think if we didn't allow the editing to happen here, we didn't allow you to go back and edit it and restore it. Where would I go and edit it if I had the privileges to do so? Well,

Unknown Speaker  37:29
I guess herein lies the problem, because if it's

Speaker 3  37:37
if it's stored on the contract record, then there is no single record to validate it. I think you have to have a payments, payment detail screen that's very similar to what we have now.

Speaker 2  37:51
And this, this transaction here, would create that detail screen, and that would be the detail screen that you would have to go edit. Um,

Unknown Speaker  38:02
well,

Unknown Speaker  38:03
okay, wait a minute.

Speaker 2  38:10
I almost want to instinctively say, for the sake of continuity in the brain, that the payment screen would would always be read only with a button that says Edit payment, which would drag you back into the Whiz key to fix it, just for the continuity of people, like physically taking payments or changing payments. It happens here.

Speaker 3  38:35
Oh, that's fine. I don't mind that you basically would never see the detail screen. I think that's completely reasonable.

Speaker 2  38:39
Well, it's not that you wouldn't necessarily see the detail screen. It's like you can't edit that detail screen. That's not where you do your

Unknown Speaker  38:45
editing well.

Speaker 2  38:53
But if you don't see it at all, how do you get back into here to edit it? It's after, it's after, it's afterwards.

Unknown Speaker  39:01
Okay? That opens up the screen for the existing payment.

Speaker 2  39:14
This is one of these things that I feel like we should just, let's just keep walking forward, because when we get to this point and we start interacting with this, some of this is going to become really, really clear on how this exactly needs to work. We might do some iterations of this. I'm not necessarily saying that is the way we need to do this, that we always come back into the whiskey. I want to get I want to get Leanne's thoughts on this, but I tend to agree with you that we do need a payments record of everything that happened here? Does are we going back to the source of truth that being the payment record? Are we going to stay with the source of truth being on the contract?

Speaker 3  39:51
Well, if you need one of the things that we did is a payment is just a payment. There is nothing magical. So if you want to forgive, if you want to forgive a fee, or if. You want to override the payment date, you have to go to the contract, okay,

Speaker 2  40:05
and so it's just a payment. So why would it we just have, why would there be a a payments RG on the contract record that

Speaker 3  40:13
it's fine, as long as you always use a whiskey to edit. Sorry, go ahead and you'd want, Oh, okay.

Speaker 2  40:17
So then, then, if, if we had an edit button in the whiskey, wrote that said, edit payment onto that one, and then you click that payment drives you back into the whiskey,

Speaker 3  40:26
right? The main thing is that when you make when you modify payment, you might be taking money from one contract and assigning it to another, in which case you need to atomically update both contracts, which you can't do through a detailed screen,

Speaker 2  40:39
right? You would need to come back into whiskey to do it. You to do it right, because some of those may be split. So, okay, so, so what you're saying is that each transaction has a unique ID that ties out to a that ties out to whiskey,

Speaker 3  40:58
or, Yes, sir, there's a payment ID and launch off of a contact, or could launch off of an ID, off of a transaction, specific transaction.

Speaker 2  41:08
So are you backing up then saying we do not need a payment record?

Speaker 3  41:12
We do need it. No, I think, I think we do need it. You don't want to store the authorization, in my opinion, and for the sake of accounting, you don't want to have

Speaker 2  41:22
you want to know, I gather what you're saying. I see where you're going with this. But it's not necessarily a detail screen record that's that's useful for the individual. It's

Speaker 3  41:33
this information. No, it's not. It's this information right here. Yeah, that's the payment detail. And, no, it's not use me, and we do need a view modification listing down the bottom.

Speaker 2  41:56
Wait, sorry, I glanced over because Josh just messaged me. Said you need a on a modification history, on, on where,

Unknown Speaker  42:10
if we have these rds, the modification history will be, modification Well, on the payment details, that's what's going to be on the on,

Speaker 3  42:25
and potentially. And then, if you want it on the contract, you copy the contract.

Speaker 3  42:41
It would only be relevant for checks, basically, or somebody comes in and changes the reference number.

Speaker 3  42:54
And this would show the payment modification, basically, for the payments record

Speaker 2  42:57
itself, okay, let me take two minutes to let me, let me message Josh back on this, because I think he and I are passing each other, and I'm afraid that That's what's happening, and it's getting A little scary. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  44:02
oh, okay, so?

Unknown Speaker  44:26
Oh, no, man, I think this is getting. This is getting really close. If not there,

Speaker 3  44:34
they're gonna ask about this. I I'm pretty optimistic about this. Jonathan would be just beyond giddy to start implementing it. So to tell you that,

Speaker 2  44:47
let's do it. What's, what's the I mean, hammer down. So as long as, as long as, okay, let me ask if I. Different question, because when we go into the whiskey side of things, it feels to me that stuff on the platform is fairly easy to iterate off of and rejigger. Does it get more critical the moment we start writing in Wiz in whizky land? Or do we still have a lot of freedom to go? And I want to move this here and that there, and up and up and down and left and right. And

Unknown Speaker  45:24
I have a really frustrating answer, and it depends, like rearranging stuff, not that big of a deal, changing colors, not that big of a deal.

Unknown Speaker  45:40
But for,

Speaker 2  45:49
okay, I saw something that recaps your rose. Okay, the next due date is deceptive. Next do for which contract? Oh, that's for this contract. Okay, never mind. I just now catching up. I thought there was this Gotcha, okay.

Speaker 2  46:17
I do wonder the only thing, the only thing that'd be kind of cool is contract 173 and then we brought in some product information from the from the product record. And, you know, I don't know a concatenation, like, if it's a structure, you know, 10 by 16 barn with blah, blah, blah,

Speaker 2  46:49
yeah, that's it. That's it right there, or something like that. I'm not sure about the language in that, in that bar, but yes, 1000 feet. 1000 feet, six inches, that is one heck of a shed.

Speaker 3  47:11
Yeah, you're not lying. That's why you're in the office of RTO company. No other company would take it.

Unknown Speaker  47:20
That's why I'm the dark RTO company.

Unknown Speaker  47:22
That is why.

Unknown Speaker  47:41
Yeah, something like that,

Speaker 2  47:45
something like that. Yeah, hammer down on this. Let's go. Let's go. Let me go back. Go back there one second. Do we want to add some messaging on here that says and to to forgive late fees or fixed due dates? Like, do we want to give them some direction of where to go to do that.

Unknown Speaker  48:31
Or actually,

Speaker 2  48:36
actually let me this. Go to your go to your receipt page. Do Okay, the great on the receipt. I like the receipt. But if you if from right here, if you wanted to go to fix a due date or a late fee, forgive a late fee. We need a way to either here or we get back. Some way to get back to your view, contract, URL, I don't know if that's here or do we say we go back to this, to the prior screen, where everything is read only.

Speaker 3  49:15
We could have a new contract here that doesn't print,

Unknown Speaker  49:20
yep, yep, that would be good.

Speaker 2  49:27
Is that what you want? Yeah, let's do that. Let's do the view contract there and forget the messaging. Yeah.

Speaker 3  49:45
Process Payment. Now, let's do any matter.

Unknown Speaker  50:20
Of that got love. It didn't

Unknown Speaker  50:26
even say we can even rename this to

Speaker 2  50:30
edit view or update or view and add update or, yeah, let's do that.

Unknown Speaker  50:39
All of them. Did you view or edit contract?

Unknown Speaker  50:42
Yep, yep.

Speaker 2  50:53
Have you just done, like, most of Jonathan's work for him, like you just pass this code off to him and say, Go, get to work.

Unknown Speaker  50:59
Well,

Speaker 3  51:00
I mean, it's a little bit of Go clean this up, make sure it's nice. I think Joshua and server side rendering on this stuff. Well, I don't know how he distributed that. I should check in with us, which, if that's the case, when you change the customer, you're gonna have to refresh the screen.

Speaker 2  51:23
Yeah, but you're gonna, you're gonna change the customer from, not from here. We're getting rid of that.

Speaker 3  51:28
Oh, we are. Okay. Well, let's sorry, I mean, yeah, let's,

Speaker 2  51:31
let's get rid of that, and let's, and let's, let's do a search, customer

Speaker 3  51:36
URL, yes. Well, would you want something like payment, customer payment for Jane Doe, number 127,

Speaker 2  51:46
well, you have that, put that down the customer details, okay,

Unknown Speaker  51:52
okay, let's lose, you know, contract.

Unknown Speaker  51:55
No, I

Speaker 3  52:13
contract, no process, payment unit, okay, let's do these changes. Okay, so then on the customer right, we had started talking about that, and then you, you said, Wait. And then we waited, okay, do you want the account number in his name, in their name, number 123, or do you want a separate field?

Unknown Speaker  52:34
Yep, that's good. I

Speaker 2  52:45
like that. Now let's add the search new customer, all right. Button, or, yeah, probably button, URL. I don't know, something that looks cool. I

Unknown Speaker  53:06
you um, good, all right, so Then up here,

Unknown Speaker  53:51
it looks cool.

Unknown Speaker  54:00
That's funny.

Unknown Speaker  54:03
Oh, they really took it seriously.

Speaker 2  54:22
Oh, man, that's funny. A color gradient on there is a little I like, a little bit of a wiggle. That's kind of cool. Can we make the rest of the buttons wiggle too? That's funny. Search, new customer. I like it, Jonathan, I'll figure out the colors. But yes,

Speaker 3  54:43
well, Justin, Justin Reese, the UX guy, can help make it look pretty. Yeah, yeah, I'm happy if you're happy. Now, the question

Speaker 2  54:54
the passing back and forth between platform and the whiskey. I have a little bit of a concern because of the and this is, this comes from the assist side, but it is that you are logging into two different systems. Is there a way to make that login a little bit more seamless?

Unknown Speaker  55:20
It's called H Mac. Okay,

Speaker 2  55:23
I don't know what H Can I, can I please have the Can I please have the the condenser with the Apple sign on it, please.

Speaker 3  55:33
H Mac, to put it very simply, both sides have a secret key, the whiskey and the silver map. And then, when you and then you pass a URL with a third kind of a you pass anything, if any information people can see in the URL. But you then you had a third like, kind of like a, what's like the like the wax Panther McCain that says this has not been tampered with that both people can calculate it to make sure that it's the right value.

Speaker 2  56:06
So, so that will be, it'll be totally seamless going back and

Speaker 3  56:09
forth. It'll be totally seamless going backwards. There's no logic required. Okay,

Speaker 2  56:13
perfect, perfect.

Unknown Speaker  56:17
Okay, so, but then there was something,

Speaker 2  56:18
all right, I'm going to take A quick bathroom break. You're at that. All right, you

Unknown Speaker  58:26
Okay, I'm back. Yes, I like it. Can you hear me? If I

Speaker 3  58:33
can hear you, okay. Did I get rid of my Vin decoder? Because that was I wanted to test the embedding. What would be a way I could test the I mean,

Unknown Speaker  58:53
if we go into

Speaker 3  59:21
a minute so want to make sure that there's not some kind of weird surprise. Josh said it should work, so I'm assuming he's true. But

Unknown Speaker  59:40
why is that not? Loading wise,

Unknown Speaker  59:53
that's fun. It's not well there it worked, okay. But how do I make it in bed?

Unknown Speaker  1:00:50
We have looks where it is.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:04
Life i Okay, so we can't embed it in the audio.

Speaker 2  1:04:35
It can you hear me? Yeah? You can Yeah. Was only just updated to updated to the new

Speaker 1  1:04:47
UI. Well, hot tickety dog. I thought

Speaker 2  1:04:57
I wasn't going to get this from Look at that. Uh oh. And look at the look at the little okay side note. Is there any control over the over the watermark on the main menu?

Unknown Speaker  1:05:14
Hopefully, maybe not yet. I don't know,

Speaker 2  1:05:17
because if there's control over the watermark, I have some opinions of things I'd love to put in, dude. This makes me this makes me almost dirty this morning. I thought Josh said this wasn't coming for quite a while.

Speaker 3  1:05:31
Well, this is, this must be, why insights going assisted, going to staging,

Speaker 2  1:05:43
Oh, dude, this you just made my day. You just made my day. You just made my day.

Speaker 2  1:06:00
Dude, this looks so much more like a professional software. You just made, you just made my selling points. You just made my my likability just go up majorly. Whoever, did this, just tell them that Dwayne says the likability just went up.

Speaker 2  1:06:30
I'm excited. Okay, okay, now I got to talk to Jonathan about the icons on the left hand

Unknown Speaker  1:06:38
side. Okay, so

Speaker 3  1:06:41
I want to, I want to see if I can mark something up, just really quickly so that you can hopefully, dude,

Speaker 2  1:06:46
we're gonna have, we've got, we've got almost a month to go before the show. And we are, we are we are cooking with some gas. Man, I love it.

Speaker 3  1:07:00
This one. Um,

Speaker 3  1:07:36
time this then becomes Really

Unknown Speaker  1:07:55
I or something like

Speaker 3  1:08:29
named this guy, except named low main report.

Speaker 2  1:08:37
Oh, the boys have been busy on the product record. Look at that.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:44
So this guy needs to be here. I

Speaker 3  1:09:29
you care whether the ticket payment screen which side to take. A payment screen is like if you have a list of payments on the left and the ticket payment screen is on the right,

Speaker 2  1:09:39
opposite payment screen should be on the left and list on the right. I

Unknown Speaker  1:09:43
know it should. So you do care?

Unknown Speaker  1:09:48
Well, I mean, what?

Unknown Speaker  1:09:54
I mean, What? What? What? But

Speaker 3  1:10:02
what did that mean? There's a little bit of a technical limitation that we can do a can you put integrations in here? Let's try the I

Unknown Speaker  1:10:36
don't think they will

Unknown Speaker  1:10:49
it's still going to be rewind.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:14
There was super skinny column on the left. I'm

Unknown Speaker  1:11:18
not sure what you're chasing. Tell me what you're chasing.

Speaker 3  1:11:21
Okay, you can't put you can't just straight up, put the payments thing on the right and and the list of payments on the right, the redirect takes over the whole page. You

Speaker 2  1:11:50
but you could do, you could do a three pane, and you could give us, give us more information regarding the customer on the left hand side to make it look like it's

Speaker 1  1:12:01
worth something. I'm not sure why.

Speaker 3  1:12:10
Let's try this inside this, but I already told you that this is what I might also confused About main report default with,

Unknown Speaker  1:12:29
well, let's do this. I

Unknown Speaker  1:12:44
at some point, it starts believing me I'm

Unknown Speaker  1:13:06
IG, it starts believing me that I actually wanted a narrow column.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:22
Something

Unknown Speaker  1:13:31
there is a name to say. I

Speaker 3  1:13:46
There's a way to get rid of this. This highlight, I think. Anyway, I don't know where we can. We can

Speaker 2  1:14:00
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, didn't he didn't. He say, didn't? He say, doing this in a dashboard.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:06
He did say, putting this in that dashboard. Thank you. Wow. Thank you. That looks good dashboard. And I so this would be the whiskey. And then here we said.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:16
Here again, I'm

Unknown Speaker  1:15:28
that,

Unknown Speaker  1:15:34
and And the, yeah, yeah, oh, this is so nice.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:48
Well, it's good to leave this guy so that.

Speaker 2  1:15:56
So Okay, explain, explain the difference between, to me, between dashboards and multi paying reports, because it sure seems like dashboards function a whole lot better than multi pain

Speaker 3  1:16:08
reports, but I guess built for reporting data, dashboards are built to house content,

Speaker 2  1:16:19
And you can restrict like, you can restrict what this like, where nobody can change this thing after it's there, because the regular dashboard is user, well, okay, you did check on you did uncheck and this would, this would be one where you can't, you can't hit settings on it. It just, it wouldn't have the capability be changed.

Speaker 3  1:16:39
I mean, we can make it proprietary, which means you can't edit settings on it.

Unknown Speaker  1:16:42
Yeah, yeah, we

Unknown Speaker  1:16:43
have that control.

Speaker 2  1:16:53
Sweet, I got 10 more minutes. Okay, let's do

Unknown Speaker  1:17:00
you want to talk a little bit about what you need for the demo.

Speaker 2  1:17:11
That feels like we've got to get down a rabbit hole in just 10 minutes. Okay, this for this for the for the call this afternoon. I think we should focus on cleanup and start scoping out, getting to the to September demo and what that needs to be. I have this, I have this nagging gut feeling that we're missing something, that something big, or maybe the big thing that we're missing is just a whole lot of cleanup and getting things in in usable order.

Speaker 3  1:17:46
Well, the customer portal is the big that's the that is, that is a big gaping hole.

Speaker 2  1:17:56
Okay? Customer Portal is a gaping hole, albeit it's not much different from what we just built in. I mean, yes, it is different, but it's, yeah, it's different. Never

Speaker 3  1:18:09
mind deferred payments or you can defer late fees, right?

Speaker 2  1:18:13
Okay, so I do think, I do think, for this afternoon, I really want to go through and just like, do a bunch of cleanup and say, Okay, are there questions outstanding? Because my plan had been and and part of this is, I'm saying this is because I'm behind. My plan had been on Saturday, this past Saturday, to sit down and really start digging through spec and answering questions and doing a bunch of stuff, and that turned into fixing a whole bunch of stuff. Our Airbnb got robbed, and so they still like, Okay, I see it got robbed. There's, I think that we've had an issue with a homeless guy, and he got some I think, I think our last Airbnb customer left the window open so he this air. This homeless guy crawls in the window and takes a shower, throws his nasty jacket in the dryer to try and wash it and dry it, I guess, and then takes all the things a homeless guy would want, like sheets and bedding and towels and and cleaning supplies. Like he didn't steal appliances. He didn't steal, you know, anything of great value. He just took the things that a homeless guy wants, right? So anyway, that turned into Saturday ended up where I was putting locks on all the all the closet doors that we want to keep stuff locked in and changing out the locks. So anyway, my Saturday got blew up, and I didn't get a chance to go through the spec and really spend time. And then Monday was massive pricing issues, so I feel really behind on question answering, which is probably why I feel like cleanup needs to be needs to be done, but that I would love to focus on customer portal after that, that

Speaker 3  1:19:58
fair. Jonathan. Jonathan gave a heads up. He's about to get sucked into accounting for investor tools. And so if we are at a point that we can, in some ways, I hate, like I'm a little white knuckled about moving ahead too fast with the customer portal, but in some ways, if we could mock up the customer total for him so he'd go down the next couple of weeks before he gets I don't have a problem from a constraint perspective. That's that and clean up I want to I, I don't think it's it's almost more of staying ahead of the guys. We all know that what they're working on, most of what they're working on, Matthias now some of the cleanup stuff, potentially we wouldn't have to have done for the demo. I don't really know. So then the big piece after that is, would be, would be, how do you knock up a county I um, and, I mean, we're stinking close like this is insane, and we have not been. I don't know, let me check numbers, but I don't get, I don't get the impression we've been pulling, keep pulling, even at the capacity we talked about at the beginning.

Speaker 2  1:21:25
This is awesome. I mean, okay, couple key things. We need a fake, I want to fake credit card transaction. I want to fake ACH transactions. And I don't know if there's some sort of, you know, code out there that acts like, you know, well, we just, we just, literally, I think from faking a credit card transaction is, is like, we just put a timer in in the HTML that returns some fake code back, you know, both on, yeah, we could, but faking some of that stuff, I think we, I think there's a lot of value in you. And I going back to Phase One spec. And what did we say we were going to do for phase one spec, and make sure that if we've, if we're hit, if we've checked all those boxes, go ahead

Speaker 3  1:22:13
contract entry. That's a big piece. But that doesn't involve Jonathan. I, I would push. And that's that can involve more junior guys. I would, I would almost push, yeah, I would almost push racing, first clean up, second

Unknown Speaker  1:22:35
contract entry, and maybe accounting. Yeah, model and but like you said, someone needed to use that. Okay, good.

Speaker 2  1:22:46
So is it? Is it unreasonable to say, let's see we are at the 19th August. I would like, if I was to wave a magic wand, we would be done building stuff two weeks out from the show so that we can just literally be entering dummy data and testing and dummy data and testing and dummy data and testing, so that we're not in for some surprises at the show. What point I would like to say two weeks out.

Unknown Speaker  1:23:20
So by the fifth.

Speaker 2  1:23:23
So the show is, mbsra is what the 23rd 23rd so this would be the ninth that we're done. We're well, let's just say the week of the eighth that we've wrapped up. You know, any big stuff so that we can be entering dummy data and making sure things are working right.

Speaker 3  1:23:45
Realistically, what we should do is aim to have main development done, because there is going to be, I mean, we have, we have two and a half weeks at this point.

Speaker 2  1:24:03
What, two and a half weeks till to the fifth, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:24:08
Oh, you're right.

Unknown Speaker  1:24:14
All right, well,

Speaker 2  1:24:18
and I am. And to be fair, like, one of the things I really should start doing is just entering, okay, okay. One of the things we could talk about this afternoon is, is building some quick customer imports. So I could literally go dump data out of a bunch of customers, out of an RTO company, name, address, phone number, stuff, and we just do a quick import of of customer data, contract data is going to have to be a little bit more, I don't know. Let's talk. Let's talk about that this afternoon. If you

Speaker 3  1:24:52
want sample data, we have, we have these might not name, the name that you want to use, but we didn't suck. I. And we can suck all these guys out. Oh,

Unknown Speaker  1:25:09
you're welcome to use this.

Speaker 2  1:25:11
The question is going to be a way to suck up the way to as fast as possible build contracts and and payment history for some of this stuff.

Unknown Speaker  1:25:24
Well, if you,

Speaker 3  1:25:26
if, if the guys give you an import with a sample file, you and Brock could use create that thing pretty fast.

Speaker 2  1:25:36
Sample, sample contracts, data, yeah, okay.

Speaker 3  1:25:43
I mean, an hour of working with rock will get you what you can get you all the time.

Unknown Speaker  1:25:47
All right, let's

Speaker 2  1:25:49
talk about this. Okay. Are you got an agenda? We got an agenda for the afternoon. Let's see. Agenda number

Speaker 3  1:25:55
one is, go ahead. Yeah, exactly, go ahead.

Speaker 2  1:25:59
Agenda number one is, is question answering and cleanup. Go through the spec and see if we're missing anything that the guys have been asking for. Two, let's, let's deal with customer portal and and three, let's talk about, was there another one in there? Sample Data? None of them.

Unknown Speaker  1:26:21
Well, contract entry,

Speaker 2  1:26:24
contract entry and sample data.

Speaker 1  1:26:34
Okay, that's gonna be funny. Okay, see you. Then, Bye, sir. Thank you. Thanks. Bye.
