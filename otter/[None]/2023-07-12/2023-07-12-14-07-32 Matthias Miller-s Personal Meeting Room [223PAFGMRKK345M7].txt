Speaker 1  00:43
Sir, that's curious. Yeah, it is. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  00:47
Ben was asking me about it. And I looked over and I was like, I'm not sure that I can find any placements repeated, which is pretty impressive. Wow.

Unknown Speaker  00:55
Interesting. Okay. So let me go through.

Unknown Speaker  01:02
Did you look at the rosewood ad? Yeah,

Matthias Miller  01:06
I wasn't sure how much to finagle or didn't have some thoughts. Sure. Seemed like they're not quite as succinct

Unknown Speaker  01:19
as they could have been.

Unknown Speaker  01:29
But generally, my only question was perhaps the

Matthias Miller  01:41
the wording of some of the bullet points, turning them down, but maybe it's fine. Sure it is.

Speaker 2  01:47
And are we wanted to highlight outgrowing your accounting systems?

Unknown Speaker  01:53
Or is that just fine?

Unknown Speaker  02:00
I mean, is that the paint? Maybe it is.

Matthias Miller  02:04
I mean, it might be the film pain point. Yeah. Might not be good. A new accounting system? Yeah, it might be. Yeah, of course, we're looking to do that. I don't know. I think people are more likely to wake up and say, Man, QuickBooks is really obnoxious then. Yeah. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  02:23
It's, it's crisp.

Unknown Speaker  02:27
So.

Speaker 2  02:33
Okay, and so I is interesting. I'm trying to compare it to the end trying to figure out what what I think one way or another. Like, the image is fairly undramatic. But the message shouts I mean, which is, and in some ways, maybe it's about right. I mean, you know, I don't think I add will get any prizes for for just gorgeous, being gorgeous. But

Unknown Speaker  03:08
but on the other hand, this is fast track. I mean,

Unknown Speaker  03:12
yeah. Well,

Matthias Miller  03:17
I think, Okay, one thing I like about the visual and the design, is that it has a substantial amount of whitespace.

Speaker 2  03:24
Exactly, yes. Yes. In a magazine that is very short on whitespace. And it emphasizes what we're talking about. Simplicity, clarity.

Matthias Miller  03:39
And for as much as black enrolled, pushed for that it's interesting that they take it quite far enough. Or, or certainly, there's

Unknown Speaker  03:54
further and the well,

Matthias Miller  04:00
here's a much more strategic question, which is, is there a way that we could test ad copy? And actually there is what do you want to take the time to do is to test ad copy for less than 1800 a month? Sure.

Unknown Speaker  04:30
I don't know.

Matthias Miller  04:34
I mean, the real way to test it is to test with me there's a Facebook testing methodology that's based on like $20 tests. Where you take something like this you make it a headline, you drive it to a landing page, put a little traffic behind it. Yes, that's some conversion caps. Yeah, and, and then you've split tests, business accounting, you know, the accounting versus some other thing?

Speaker 2  05:01
Sure, sure. Although there again, aren't we isn't that very audience specific? I don't know if it is or not, because how much does it matter if, like, I think part of the problem is that our clients, some of our clients don't even know what they're looking for.

Unknown Speaker  05:23
Well, if there's any software that they're

Matthias Miller  05:29
I mean, there's any software they are using sales and accounting is likely to do

Speaker 2  05:33
Yeah, yeah. That's the, I kind of think it's about I mean, first, I was trying to pick this with it, but and I mean, I'm curious why they pushed accounting down to the second line.

Unknown Speaker  05:59
Yeah, I think

Speaker 2  06:01
I might ask the question, because I'm happy with whatever you decide. But anyway, oh, oh, the other question I had is and this is kind of back to the custom customize, whatever. If well, okay, important. This is this may be what we ended up putting in the Lancaster Business Exchange.

Unknown Speaker  06:25
So I mean,

Speaker 2  06:28
I do think that the headline has maybe captures our our sweet spot by chaos, LOL clarity. So hit the pain hit the success. Bam. So

Unknown Speaker  06:53
anyway, so

Speaker 2  06:54
maybe it's just pretty close to right. spending too much time on mechanics running your business? Yeah, I mean, and okay, if and I could even pick a little bit nit on there is is that? Is it? Is it? When somebody is entering sales orders and doing accounting work? Do they think of that as run? Is that

Unknown Speaker  07:14
running your business?

Speaker 2  07:16
Or is it the owner, though? Is it only the owner that runs a business?

Matthias Miller  07:27
If the owner doesn't have a good system in place, he's going to feel the pain as if it were his own? No.

Unknown Speaker  07:35
Maybe? Or

Unknown Speaker  07:38
I don't know.

Speaker 2  07:43
I mean, like, with, I toyed with just just spending too much time on Office busy word. But maybe they don't think of it as busy working either.

Unknown Speaker  07:59
thing too much time in the office? Maybe?

Speaker 2  08:07
And again, oh, well, again, and some of this, I should probably just stop thinking about and just let them do their thing. And

Matthias Miller  08:17
yeah, I don't know that it's necessarily wrong or bad. Yeah, I think it's even it's also a question for you. Yeah, in my mind, it's still kind of goes back to

Matthias Miller  08:38
how can we most clearly model the current customer, like if we can come up with an audience that maybe is slightly more sophisticated, but very comfortable on Facebook? I think ultimately, though, this stuff comes down to we can either wait a year and see which ones of these do really well. Yeah. Or look for alternate ways to test and so.

Matthias Miller  09:12
And I think too, for some of these things, having a also just checking in with somebody and saying, like, how much do we how many questions we ask them. There's so much to be like. Sure, sure. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 1  09:31
Yeah. Well,

Speaker 2  09:35
okay. You know, and I think I'm just I'm mostly going to accept this because later on, they're going to do like 12 ads in a row for us. And at that point, then I think we Hasulam and pagal and things like that. Right. I think that's fair.

Unknown Speaker  09:58
Yeah. So,

Speaker 2  10:02
and I mean, at that point, we may be able to say, hey, you know, there might be better ways to say point two or point three or whatever, but,

Matthias Miller  10:08
and then we can also make those corrections and backs, which is going to substantially help. Exactly, exactly. Yep. Good.

Unknown Speaker  10:17
Okay, that sounds fair. Um, the

Unknown Speaker  10:37
me see here, wherever I go here. Way too many windows open.

Unknown Speaker  10:47
I just closed this the whole thing out

Unknown Speaker  10:55
the

Unknown Speaker  10:58
Okay, there we go. There it is. So

Speaker 2  11:06
let me just flag things that can be fun phone. Naming branding survey and modules lists are two things that well, the modules list, I could just show it to you a bit, then we could probably finish that up by phone. So there's a link there in the document. And I'm not sure what level of detail we want here. The descriptions we can certainly just do I think we could probably do by phone then. Or I can just smash something in the

Speaker 2  11:46
I think I could probably do something like core four core.

Unknown Speaker  11:53
And while the I don't know

Unknown Speaker  11:57
timecard incidents

Unknown Speaker  12:02
counting

Speaker 2  12:17
is route management a module actually? Or is that just an example? I mean, yeah, okay. Logistics?

Unknown Speaker  12:23
I don't know. I don't know if it is one or not. It's,

Speaker 2  12:26
I mean, it's a little bit like scheduling that, oh, we can do this kind of thing. Right. I mean, scheduling, we use a framework.

Matthias Miller  12:35
I think I think if you're using the very very broad generous definition of sure the word. Yeah, they're smack dab in. Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 2  12:56
It's estimates and quoting part of the sale. Well, I don't even though I don't know how to categorize these. And maybe I shouldn't even it's often considered part of the sales process, isn't it? Yeah, I think so.

Unknown Speaker  13:13
Scheduling is considered to be part of logistics.

Unknown Speaker  13:16
That's fair. I think that's reasonable. Is inventory logistics? Or is that do you view that as accounting?

Unknown Speaker  13:25
That's like counting ish. I mean, you can argue it either way. I think.

Matthias Miller  13:31
You can argue it either way. But it's used more, I think, unless you're specifically looking to go to cost based accounting, it's used more success for better numbers. Sorry, better management more than the production side than it is actually financial.

Speaker 2  13:57
Fair. So do we push that up to the top of it of logistics? Although I mean, I think I might just leave it here even though I'm not sure it's quite right. But it's I mean, it really important and boring.

Matthias Miller  14:15
Another option would be changing the production and to production management, what's the right

Unknown Speaker  14:26
operations,

Matthias Miller  14:28
operations is pretty good. Yeah. Management is specifically logistics like that is that is basically what they what they really mean. That is what would this typically means? Okay.

Speaker 2  14:55
Is there any I mean, some ways we could almost think through other clients and and well and maybe we could do that separately but just maybe when you're on the phone we could even start going through the list of so is our incidents can I drop incidents down incidents down to operations?

Unknown Speaker  15:15
We probably could reclaim support or

Matthias Miller  15:20
I mean I think incidents can can double up in both Yeah, wait for that might be worth actually bringing it multiple ways and Sure, sure. Yeah.

Speaker 2  15:32
Do I kill project management? I'm sure what that catalog is.

Matthias Miller  15:38
It's something that's an extension of incidents that I use in DCH Okay, I think I'll just

Unknown Speaker  15:45
take it off for now

Speaker 2  15:53
is it are the sales opportunities with well maybe I'll just say incidents as well. I think

Matthias Miller  16:04
I think they should be in my opinion they should be separate from a marketing standpoint. Good sir. Good every toilet water was nice. And thinking both went for that independently of anything else because of some of the workload flow tracking or exactly what it was? Yeah.

Speaker 2  16:26
So so fine, do it.

Unknown Speaker  16:29
Well, you disagree?

Speaker 2  16:33
No, no, I liked as I was just thinking through how I name it, do I name it sales opportunities reduce Neil? Is it incidents in incidents and sales opportunities?

Matthias Miller  16:44
Or I I would as much as we can, I would separate it in the fact that it's it's the same thing under the hood. Sure, fine. I think this is I think part of part of the whole shift is let's mark it from features from features and user use case not from how it's implemented. So you can actually have one thing for you know, project management one for support incidents or ticketing and one for sales opportunities. It uses the same thing under the hood it's

Unknown Speaker  17:17
sure Yeah.

Matthias Miller  17:36
Word Microsoft Word Microsoft Excel

Unknown Speaker  17:46
that's an integration or sure

Unknown Speaker  18:12
you want to classical counting on there? Isn't that

Speaker 2  18:27
don't know if I anyway, I mean, I'm not sure we should list every feature Okay. Classic accounting Sure.

Unknown Speaker  19:06
Well, what is this a place to start? And then we can always

Speaker 2  19:18
in D, if somebody says, hey, I want to take the do the time off tracking, is that clean enough module is pretty easy to add.

Unknown Speaker  19:31
I think so.

Matthias Miller  19:33
I separated out their different pieces in the core modules. Okay. Three, six.

Speaker 2  19:40
Yeah. Does it do the does it use the time cards or something else?

Matthias Miller  19:46
No, well, yes, it pushes down to time birds. Okay, approve time off request.

Speaker 2  19:53
So should I split HR into any time tracking it's even time try Hacking is that you know is that HR is that is that accounting is that operations but

Matthias Miller  20:12
your answer your question I mean I think even time based billing sure TNM billing

Unknown Speaker  21:01
time off man yeah

Matthias Miller  21:22
oh this is a place to start something they were also asking for descriptions

Unknown Speaker  21:29
yeah

Unknown Speaker  21:36
yeah

Matthias Miller  21:50
I don't know we'll probably just I mean, I'm gonna guess this is once again if we're any type of description say again probably more of a marketing type I mean not saying a hyperlink document management system was surprised that

Unknown Speaker  22:15
we also have

Matthias Miller  22:20
our snippet feature which is like quick copy checklists through insolence in working documents I don't know if it's worth mentioning maybe not email reminders is also Yeah, email reminders is cool.

Unknown Speaker  22:38
But if I put that up in communities

Unknown Speaker  22:41
where does that go

Speaker 2  22:48
it's not really communications it's almost operations I don't know. Or do you have an automation section

Unknown Speaker  23:05
let me try that. No

Matthias Miller  23:15
did you get this from the proposal list? This this list

Unknown Speaker  23:21
here Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  23:23
I went through the catalogs

Unknown Speaker  23:29
Is there is there something client proposals No, I

Matthias Miller  23:34
don't think so. Okay, well, I mean the only thing would be if there's things that we designed but not sold or Sure yeah.

Unknown Speaker  23:58
I'm not sure if that'll be.

Matthias Miller  24:13
Whenever anything about imports, we should

Unknown Speaker  24:23
set up an integration integration

Matthias Miller  25:51
In this instance it feels so like

Unknown Speaker  26:30
bilberry man you're good compared to me

Matthias Miller  31:10
Google Calendar is currently just a one way in words. Oh, so

Unknown Speaker  31:14
should we just kill it for now? I want to be seen sure

Unknown Speaker  31:38
and I'm not super proud of our questionnaire so I almost be

Unknown Speaker  31:42
willing to kill that too.

Matthias Miller  31:44
Yeah, I mean for the Amish guys I went to type form and did a whip. Yeah, sure. Sidenote, I would love I don't know where this fits Abraham expensive or who would pay for it or here's a client for it but I would love to make.com or Zapier integration of some kind meaning make.com because of their pricing. But imagine that you could go in there and you can select you have basically this web services thing you can go select say run an import and pass data into there or you can have a web hook that would fire or a I don't know why even even pushing even for imports and pushing in the system. Okay, well

Unknown Speaker  32:31
this is this is simply enough. Okay,

Speaker 2  32:36
I'll send it off good thank you either my brains tired or you're just amazing with words are both

Unknown Speaker  32:49
Oh, I just

Unknown Speaker  32:53
Oh, you were putting down in front

Speaker 2  32:58
Well, I don't mind do whatever you want to do I just send the email

Unknown Speaker  33:05
I don't have so you can strike it out if you want to.

Speaker 2  33:18
Naming and branding surveys probably the other piece that we really need computer for.

Unknown Speaker  33:26
And I might have Joel join that. It will because you won't be on the call next week, right? Yeah,

Matthias Miller  33:36
that's nice. Well, yeah. Hopefully not. 5% Well, no,

Speaker 2  33:43
I will. Yep. Good. That's totally fine. So let me have Joel join the call and then because because I think I'll have him join that call and I thought very helpful for you to hear us talking here so

Unknown Speaker  34:01
um and I created a Google Document

Speaker 2  34:08
oh by the way, when the when they send me links and stuff like they recently did then i i find ways to drop at least drop a shortcut on our drive so nice. So you can you can kind of think of the drive as the place to go for

Unknown Speaker  34:24
things related. Yeah. Okay

Speaker 1  34:36
whether we does the Okay. Okay, there we've

Unknown Speaker  34:45
got a link for the naming survey. You want the naming brief.

Unknown Speaker  34:51
So okay,

Speaker 2  34:56
so we are ready to jump into the naming branding survey here. um and it's the PD is not the PDF it's the Word files once yeah and so I started filling things in but I was just kind of getting ready to help you have some assistance here. So goal of the assignment moved from code crafters provides custom software development to code Procaster provides a customizable business software suite have a product brand that clients value and identify with

Speaker 2  35:37
and we don't need to initial stuff I had started doing that and I think that's silly so

Matthias Miller  35:57
you can add something in here like

Matthias Miller  36:06
making product grand central to what we offer. I said again, sorry, I'm grabbing water make the product brand central to what we offer. Yes, sure. I think if I had to, if I would remove that completely remove there's another way to protect or to completely remove the past from it. It's something like

Speaker 1  36:27
developing a soft software product the product brand or a

Matthias Miller  36:37
software suite that

Unknown Speaker  36:41
emphasizes that establishes credibility

Unknown Speaker  36:59
something like that. Sure. Sure. Yep.

Unknown Speaker  37:10
I'm so in a in a shell not code crap. I wasn't Anyway, take a crack at that one. Matthias, what do you think? One thing is operations might be a bit too small.

Unknown Speaker  37:29
But well, I'm going to push towards clarity. What if

Matthias Miller  37:47
I think your question is wrong. Sum up your product on sentence.

Speaker 2  37:53
Oh, fair. Okay. It seems that this naming sometimes, okay. So just strike that out and just put in product

Unknown Speaker  38:03
or whatever, whatever.

Speaker 3  38:06
So just to confirm, I have not yet actually listened to the sure things. But here we are naming the product.

Unknown Speaker  38:17
Yes, specifically or a brand? Yes.

Speaker 2  38:20
So this will this will probably replace app hosting that.com It will probably become our dominant brand and advertising is will likely be something like you know ninja warrior with by code crafters or something underneath Hollywood ninja warrior with our I was thinking Hollywood Ninja Warrior. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  38:51
I mean, if you could introduce sort of a mystical aspect that would

Unknown Speaker  38:57
sort of optimize it.

Speaker 2  38:58
And maybe, maybe how about we can add the word. Biden's in there too.

Unknown Speaker  39:11
Anyway,

Speaker 2  39:11
how do you want your brand to be marketing them? Position the marketplace? I mean, I think we go for Premier. I don't know what word we well, first of all

Matthias Miller  39:23
I would still argue that this should then be

Unknown Speaker  39:33
sure. Are you okay with that? Yeah, sure.

Unknown Speaker  39:42
Sure,

Matthias Miller  39:42
I think it's opera. I mean, operations is

Unknown Speaker  39:52
Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  39:52
yeah, I think it's good. It's enough. It's enough.

Unknown Speaker  39:54
covers a broad

Unknown Speaker  39:56
scope. Yeah.

Speaker 2  39:59
I I think that's what they're trying to reach for is where we're positioned the marketplace. I mean, I don't know if maybe sounds expensive maybe Premier is a better term but I mean, we're we're not trying to target enterprise that sounds boring but we certainly are putting you know, we're working likely I'm sure insure this is not cheap, but it's really good.

Unknown Speaker  40:30
So all right.

Speaker 3  40:33
Are they thinking more in terms of you know, positioning map or word associations

Unknown Speaker  40:40
or what kind

Unknown Speaker  40:45
of thing

Unknown Speaker  40:48
I don't know for sure.

Matthias Miller  40:51
You had mentioned Ella's the idea and one of the positioning pieces is being the hybrid of customer and retail because when Gina more thoughts and well

Speaker 3  41:12
Okay, so here I mean, what I see in high end is either rice or some combination of you know, functionality and price with function

Unknown Speaker  41:34
functionality also

Unknown Speaker  41:37
fairly vague term but

Unknown Speaker  41:42
I will okay go ahead do that may actually be

Speaker 3  41:52
I mean there are these different levers there's a breadth of functionality we're low on that there's there's customization we're high on that

Unknown Speaker  42:21
now oh yeah yeah.

Speaker 2  42:52
When I guess we could start saying if we don't know what they're reaching for, we could start just start giving some examples you know, price we expect to be middle high and

Unknown Speaker  43:10
low or medium high. The

Unknown Speaker  43:19
Excellence

Unknown Speaker  43:24
is

Speaker 2  43:26
I'm not sure that's the right word. Excellent skill is is very high. I mean

Speaker 1  43:45
how does what does that look like to the customer? Oh, okay. Well, that's a fair question.

Matthias Miller  43:55
So when somebody's looking to buy, it's kind of like

Unknown Speaker  44:00
it is it is a

Matthias Miller  44:05
really good start by what it's not. It's not the cheap el cheapo solution. But it's also not one of those slick salesmen who charges five times what you ought to but it is high quality

Unknown Speaker  44:43
How about that?

Speaker 2  44:47
I mean, I think that gets us close to what, where we're wanting to be positioned. I mean, where were

Unknown Speaker  44:56
you is one

Unknown Speaker  44:57
other aspect of the value we offer For well, okay I'm thinking support I'm not sure how that compares to say to some of these others

Speaker 2  45:16
yes it is no exact exactly right when they boil down our kind of core adjectives it was innovation or innovative supportive and clarity or simplicity so so I do think support is in some ways that's the experience oh interesting is experience our experience or is it the client experience

Speaker 2  45:55
Matthias when you were saying experience you're talking about our experience

Unknown Speaker  45:58
right yeah,

Matthias Miller  46:01
I really I really heard this as we're mixing metaphors Sure so

Unknown Speaker  46:28
sure

Unknown Speaker  47:03
don't know if this is right

Unknown Speaker  47:10
you can also add I might just do that

Unknown Speaker  47:16
innovative solutions

Unknown Speaker  47:23
so clearly

Unknown Speaker  47:23
what we aren't

Unknown Speaker  47:28
and I guess what we could okay I'm sure

Matthias Miller  47:44
yes, I'm sometimes a little sad.

Speaker 2  48:56
So think about COBOL which I don't know if this is what they are or not, but you know, this it's expensive. It's lots of features. It's, you know,

Speaker 1  49:08
clumsy, heavy weight software with

Matthias Miller  49:15
that's difficult to use

Unknown Speaker  49:26
I don't know. Is there anything else you want to add there?

Unknown Speaker  49:52
Sure, yeah. Okay, well, I think That's

Speaker 2  50:00
good enough we can keep driving. I think that's it's pretty good. What are the tastes and quirks that personas you deserve like smash up Java personas and see number five see marketing message personas

Unknown Speaker  50:16
and

Speaker 2  50:33
I mean, can I just tell them to see the marketing message? Or I guess we can we can list some things.

Unknown Speaker  50:41
Its simplicity

Unknown Speaker  50:48
data data What do you mean by that?

Matthias Miller  50:57
I mean, isn't there a part of this word it's people be like well, they

Unknown Speaker  51:10
Yes, yes.

Unknown Speaker  51:34
And so that is driven by pain

Speaker 3  51:42
I guess. Okay, tastes I guess that'd be quirks

Unknown Speaker  51:47
rather than tastes.

Matthias Miller  51:51
What are the words that are unique to these guys?

Unknown Speaker  52:00
What are their quirks?

Unknown Speaker  52:06
I mean, one of them is

Matthias Miller  52:09
one software, but don't always have the technology.

Unknown Speaker  52:12
Yeah, sure. It's

Unknown Speaker  52:24
the allowed technology for the um,

Speaker 2  52:32
I think our best customers are ridiculously smart. Or super, or I guess I guess smart. So right word.

Unknown Speaker  52:44
But they are

Unknown Speaker  52:48
maybe just smart and entrepreneurial. Is that true?

Matthias Miller  52:56
Well, they kind of like solving their own.

Unknown Speaker  52:58
I mean.

Unknown Speaker  53:06
Is it true?

Unknown Speaker  53:13
Maybe it's universal? Yeah. I

Unknown Speaker  53:15
think it's universal. Yeah. Well,

Unknown Speaker  53:20
one.

Speaker 3  53:23
It makes me think of something from lean startup. And just that, I think that that is specifically for some of your early adopters or evangelists that there are people who have already put resources into trying to solve some of these problems.

Speaker 2  53:52
Yeah, interesting. Okay. Just just wants to comment on that. Maybe the our best clients are the people that were actually able to understand our ads and figure out that this would work for that this might work for them. And Rosewood may actually be able to dumb it down to where we'll have more discouraging people. We think we ever learned. I mean, they're fine to work with, but they're not innovative, smart.

Matthias Miller  54:20
Yeah, but I think also, this is like, this is why we have Tim's and Ben's in the world. Yeah. And or I don't know. And other folks who will enjoy working with these folks with them, even if it's not like yeah, chattering Yeah. I think I mean, here's the here's the issue. I mean, there's isn't business, usually the trade off between excitement and stability?

Unknown Speaker  54:50
I mean, yes, yes, it truly is.

Speaker 4  54:52
We're not going to have an exciting if we do our job well. Okay, there may be anybody yeah that's yeah that's that's good. Well that'd be really nice do

Unknown Speaker  55:04
can we keep going yeah

Speaker 2  55:08
yeah I mean forward thinking business owners skilled in their craft but basically we've got all the personas they just need to go look at personas

Unknown Speaker  55:21
there anything else you want to add

Unknown Speaker  55:29
Do you have anything

Matthias Miller  55:35
yep if you if we are moving in I mean there's there's things like service Titan and NetSuite and like all of those where you're trying to sort of like when you graduate from custom software you're distancing yourself from the custom software companies but you're also moving yourself into some of those those ones in those names have come up and

Unknown Speaker  56:08
I wonder if it's worth mentioning

Speaker 2  56:15
down below down further down there's name styles that you like or you dislike themes to explore to avoid

Unknown Speaker  56:52
okay so I mean

Matthias Miller  56:54
tablets capitalist retail storefronts

Unknown Speaker  57:00
go ahead clarity

Matthias Miller  57:05
What's the opposite of overwhelm?

Speaker 1  57:08
Calm some competent calm and competent

Unknown Speaker  57:16
relaxing calm or relaxed

Unknown Speaker  57:20
calm slash or okay yes Tom sure

Unknown Speaker  57:47
no overwhelmed no more overwhelmed

Speaker 2  58:06
actually if you too could just make me feel calm and calm calm and competent that would be great right now

Speaker 3  58:19
just did a group therapy session

Unknown Speaker  58:27
that's pretty good though. Isn't it?

Unknown Speaker  58:29
I really like it I

Matthias Miller  58:33
Yeah. You want something around growth like Scott like no longer stuck Sure.

Speaker 1  58:47
I'm anticipation we're empowered.

Matthias Miller  58:53
I don't know that that's quite the right thing.

Unknown Speaker  58:56
The sense of progress Yeah, I'm encouraged

Speaker 2  59:08
I mean, it's calm actually quite where we want to leave them

Unknown Speaker  59:15
what okay

Matthias Miller  59:19
I don't think it's a wrong thing. I think it's a looking at some level the only reason reason they're reaching out is because they have been growing at some level Yes.

Unknown Speaker  59:52
Okay, so like that

Unknown Speaker  59:59
five

Speaker 2  59:59
to 10 ad actives that describe the tone this was fun I'm not sure these are rights so we can we can add more or, or reduce this list innovative super smart unpretentious comfortable, comfortable one because I think that's something people really like that we're these are people that don't make me feel stupid that understand my culture that productive hardworking dependable friendly pleasant fun I think I think this is actually a pretty good description of of how people experience code crafters. I'm curious what you say Matthias maybe.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:41
Anyway, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:44
Maybe fun is just LS but

Unknown Speaker  1:00:50
that was my question about the brand

Speaker 2  1:01:00
that one is probably okay, we could challenge that one friendly. And leave it at friendly pleasant potentially.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:07
Although, yeah, well, that's

Speaker 2  1:01:09
a good question. I mean, Tim is not exactly Mr. jokester.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:15
So okay, but I

Unknown Speaker  1:01:21
like when I work with rosewood.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:23
Ah, man, there's,

Speaker 2  1:01:28
I think we have a different vibe back to them they do. More so in formal is maybe we could do informal instead of fun, if you'd potentially. The

Matthias Miller  1:01:44
us to go back to is that yours? The US?

Speaker 2  1:01:48
That's fair. That's fair. Right. And is that? Is that the brand?

Unknown Speaker  1:01:52
Is that the brand?

Matthias Miller  1:01:53
I mean, I think it's very different. When I think of an informer website, you think of the people who advertise on Facebook, about all the videos that you make, like, it means it like, let's, let's give me a definition, right? Even if even if we haven't

Speaker 2  1:02:09
had. Okay, so let's take fun off the list. And I'll let that be on my personal brand. I think it'll probably stay on my personal brand.

Unknown Speaker  1:02:20
We'll get get you a t shirt or something. Right.

Speaker 2  1:02:26
Sound fun? So okay, so do you like innovative super and super smart?

Matthias Miller  1:02:36
To describe the I would, I would say I would personally take the super

Speaker 2  1:02:42
sure. That's fair. That's fair, innovative, smart. And then but that's paired with unpretentious and comfort comfortable. And the unpretentious ties into well, it ties into kind of that, that that humility that's at the core of the of the Anabaptist perspective. But it also ties Yeah, I think I think people I mean it also ties into the simplicity of our software

Unknown Speaker  1:03:16
we're not glitzy flashy. I do really this feels Do you like these or not?

Speaker 2  1:03:33
I mean, does it resonate with you as what our software is?

Unknown Speaker  1:03:47
So

Unknown Speaker  1:03:58
yeah, culturally compatible.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:01
I mean, okay.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:09
I guess are we

Speaker 3  1:04:15
it feels like there is a degree to which we're melding two things here, the manifestation of our software and the way the or the artifact really, of our software and the, the way our company interacts in the world.

Speaker 2  1:04:37
Okay, fair enough. It's true. Okay, let me go back through this innovative and smart. Okay, and they're, they're trying to turn they think you should turn your brand into a person as we're all right. Right, right. So, so let's say let's make sure this is not the person who picks up the phone, but, you know, this is the if we draw If you have the robot, you know with a smile on his face, you know, solid color shirt that walks into someone's office. What does that that run the software? What does that robot like? It's innovative and smart. It really is. But it's also unpretentious, comfortable and hardworking.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:21
Be so, so

Matthias Miller  1:05:29
helpful is another good word, but it might fall into under whenever you use. Oh, it's

Unknown Speaker  1:05:34
not bad to add. So, I'm like, okay, so this is Oh, okay, what this

Speaker 2  1:05:49
isn't, is okay, on the flip side of innovative and smart is just, I mean, it's just, you know, just clunky it just doesn't work. But then it's also not your it's not corporates, you know, the guy doesn't have a corporate tie, it doesn't have you know, awful legal contracts. You know, it doesn't make you feel dumb for not having internet so that's the unpretentious comfortable and if this would be an employee that shows up you know, he'll be giving you ideas and stuff that says innovation but he's also he just cranks out work all the time and you just you can trust him. So that's the hard working productive dependable

Unknown Speaker  1:06:34
and but then there is a

Speaker 2  1:06:36
to the brand I think there is I think the customizable pneus and the fact that it fits is also in some ways kind of the helpful friendly Plitt I mean, I don't know if pleasant is quite fits in there but you know, although I do think people now it the pleasant probably that the software is certainly helpful. The friendly pleasant maybe getting over almost over to the people experience side of things. But what I don't want to have is this, this software, this this

Unknown Speaker  1:07:13
ninja buggy, I don't want it to have

Matthias Miller  1:07:17
really bad and there's gonna be a little bug and it's gonna be labeled feature

Speaker 2  1:07:26
what I don't want to have is okay, so it's not

Speaker 1  1:07:41
a suit and tie, corporate it's not snooty it's not

Unknown Speaker  1:07:57
it's not flaky

Unknown Speaker  1:08:03
anyway

Unknown Speaker  1:08:23
it's not the here today gone tomorrow

Speaker 2  1:08:37
but it's also not I don't know if it's not stuffy. So, and again, not bad is kind of pushing into my personality. Sorry. And it's interesting. I mean, to be honest, I'm not sure. I mean, I actually rose with us just a little bit on this call was recorded OKAY. SURE.
