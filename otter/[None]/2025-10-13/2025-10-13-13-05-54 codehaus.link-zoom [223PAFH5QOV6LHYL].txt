Unknown Speaker  00:15
Howdy, sir, hey, Dwayne. People running you ragged today?

Matthias Miller  00:24
It is interesting life that I live.

Unknown Speaker  00:33
Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  00:36
how picky Are you on colors

Unknown Speaker  00:39
for what? Anything? Like,

Unknown Speaker  00:43
if you go to paint your house, who picks the colors you or your

Matthias Miller  00:45
wife? Oh, my wife. Do you have? Do you okay?

Speaker 1  00:49
If you go to to create colors for a software, who picks them you or somebody else,

Matthias Miller  00:55
somebody chat, GBT, or somebody else, there's literally, like, this is that this is the reason I wear this is because it matches black. Just matches it just that's like, the simplicity of my like, literally, my wife will tell you, I'm so colorblind, really. I mean not literally colorblind, but

Speaker 1  01:20
make it, make it available that I can share. I want to get your opinion on some colors.

Matthias Miller  01:24
Should be able to why is it telling me I can't

Speaker 1  01:28
hold Shift to select to what in the world?

Unknown Speaker  01:36
What is going on?

Speaker 1  01:39
Screens, documents. I don't know what on earth is.

Unknown Speaker  01:51
Background. I don't know it's being a pain in the butt.

Speaker 1  01:58
Okay, fine. I'm going to drop you some HTML files.

Unknown Speaker  02:04
Okie dokie, so weird. Why can't I share that? Think it's this one

Unknown Speaker  02:17
and this one and this one, what Come on now,

Speaker 2  02:27
can only, okay, there's one I cannot do more than one at a time.

Matthias Miller  02:39
That would be we wouldn't want to be efficient now,

Unknown Speaker  02:42
apparently, not all right, so now there's the three, four. Let's see option

Speaker 1  02:56
for number one color palette, navy, number one, option D is what I'm looking at. Alternative D. Sorry for number two, it's option two. Okay. And for number three, it's option one. Which of those three? Okay, so here's, here's what I'm looking to do. I want to change up the contact contract and product record. And the secondary color would be the contact record, the contract is going to be exactly what it currently is, and then the product would be orange.

Matthias Miller  03:35
Okay, I'm really not a fan of the the gray, which I mean option two and option like, 3.2 point two and 3.1 is that that's what you're looking at. Option for the third one you're looking at option one, yes,

Unknown Speaker  03:56
not a fan of the gray.

Matthias Miller  03:58
It just looks I mean, first of all, in the second one, you can barely tell, in a small space, you can barely tell the difference between primary and secondary. The third one, there's just no color, like there's no it's just dead. And even on the secondary one, I would far prefer a

Speaker 1  04:13
let's do this. Are you sure you share you share these back so that I can see which ones you're looking at? Yeah.

Speaker 2  04:21
Okay,

Speaker 1  04:33
you're not a fan of option one in on this one, correct.

Matthias Miller  04:40
Okay, sorry, this one. So this one, sorry, this one, it's just gray. It's just like it just looks dead. This one is even this one's even worse, because here you can barely tell the difference on a small space. Do. This one's better. I just think the T should, the blue should still be a little brighter. I actually thought you were gonna go something more like one of these top ones. I'm like, Oh, that's cool. Like, more like best, but

Speaker 1  05:11
so you, you're more of a fan of option one on, on the one you're currently on, yeah. Or alternative a

Matthias Miller  05:20
yeah, just because, I mean, yeah, for the very reason that it's like, at first, it brings some life to the whole thing.

Speaker 1  05:29
Okay, I'm gonna, now I have your opinion. I'm gonna, I'm gonna continue to source these around and get some consensus on this. Because I don't know, for some reason I get hung up on stuff like this. Good boy, yep. But I noticed, I noticed, when demoing the software, that I get lost, whether I'm, you

Matthias Miller  05:54
know, when I'm jumping out or where you're on,

Speaker 1  05:56
yeah, because there's, there's a there's a lot of similarity between the three of them, the contract contact and the contact, contract and product, they have a lot of very similar feel. And so it's like, which 1am I on again? Where am I going? I I want to create some some visual cue. Yep.

Unknown Speaker  06:19
Yeah. All right,

Speaker 1  06:27
bring up our list of things to work on. Okay?

Matthias Miller  06:54
So we have, I need to get with Seth. I

Matthias Miller  07:18
Okay, where do you want to

Unknown Speaker  07:21
so, what? What did you? What did we push off to them?

Unknown Speaker  07:31
To do? Oh, yeah, to do. Hello. I

Unknown Speaker  07:45
just that. What's it? What's down below there? Yet? I

Speaker 1  08:03
Okay, you want to scroll back to the top. What do we want to work on today? What interests you?

Matthias Miller  08:10
I mean, sales tax records. Honestly, if you're doing manual sales tax records, that's dropped dead simple to knock out. I think, or were you wanting me to figure that out?

Unknown Speaker  08:24
Oh, you know, what

Speaker 1  08:27
can you? Can you just run a search and see what? What does? What's the per ping cost on on text jar?

Speaker 1  08:54
So basically, anything above 25,000 per month would be, I'm assuming, probably some sort of enterprise level.

Unknown Speaker  09:06
Do I want to do? I want to? Okay? Riddle me this,

Speaker 1  09:16
from an from a methodology standpoint, would you? How often would we? Would we repaying tax jar? Obviously, every time you enter a new contract, you're going to ping for that tax rate.

Matthias Miller  09:31
How are you going to handle rate changes? That's the biggest thing.

Speaker 1  09:36
Well, that's where I was going. Like, do you do you reping For every time you run sales tax. I mean,

Matthias Miller  09:44
it seems conceivable where it could make sense to make it. May do it for every single payment, but

Speaker 1  09:49
that's a lot of pinks. That's a lot of pinks. I don't want to do for

Unknown Speaker  09:55
every single payment.

Speaker 1  09:56
Essentially, you are doing it for every single pay, for every single payment. If you. Are if you, if you repaint every month when you run sales tax, here's

Speaker 1  10:11
what I'm trying to wrap my head around, do you do you pass a cost like this on to the companies? Like, okay, do you say, well, we've got three options, one is you do completely manual sales tax, and you go figure out and you build your own tables of sales tax. Or two, we can hook up tax jar to ping for every time you want to run either sales tax or for every payment. And then the third is you can, you know, completely pay sales tax by tax jar.

Speaker 1  10:50
What bugs me a little bit is that smart, RTO smart says out loud that they include it in the cost like they pay for the ping.

Speaker 1  11:10
How would this work? It let's say, for example, if we said we're going to pay for the ping, and we want to have one tax jar account, but you're and you have, let's say we've got 30 clients. Can you? Can you hook the same tax sharp account up to every single instance of the software?

Matthias Miller  11:27
I would wonder, if you want to do something crazy, like have a text or a cash where you've got a database of you do two things. One, a jurisdiction resolution, when you first set up an address, and then a rate look up. And that way, if you've got 20 people in the same rate, and you've pinged it either by calendar once per calendar month or something like that, then you can bypass the ping

Speaker 1  12:05
that crazy. I didn't I didn't understand what you said the end. Then you bypass the what

Matthias Miller  12:11
the ping like

Unknown Speaker  12:13
like you. You

Matthias Miller  12:15
have a database where you store ping results,

Speaker 1  12:18
uh huh, and then if you just recently ping, then there's no reason to reping again. If you're within a 30 day window, right?

Matthias Miller  12:29
Or a calendar, calendar month window or something, when that

Unknown Speaker  12:37
wouldn't that greatly reduce the cost. And

Matthias Miller  12:40
it seems, seems to me like you could, you would then, I mean, the equivalent would be,

Speaker 1  12:47
can, can, if you have many, many instances of the software, is there a way that we could share that database across all instances?

Matthias Miller  12:53
Yeah, we would. We would just, we would probably put it in the master instance, and the whiskey would just check that, check it, see if it's there. If not run out and get it, push it back in, like, see if the address is in there, if not resolve the address, then resolve the address Well, or do both and then, and then save the tax. Yeah.

Speaker 1  13:24
I like that idea. So basically, you would build a master database that all of your instances are talking to, and of sales tax. What did you call them?

Matthias Miller  13:41
So where is, where's

Matthias Miller  13:51
the Are these all wholesale hits?

Speaker 1  13:58
Your Are you on sales orders? Hit, the hit the sort of date range.

Matthias Miller  14:03
Oh, thank you.

Unknown Speaker  14:06
Anything with an R or an N?

Speaker 1  14:09
I guess it would be anything with an N, it's what you would want to go for see.

Matthias Miller  14:13
But we would then the database would store for this city plus county plus state plus other.

Unknown Speaker  14:19
What's the other?

Matthias Miller  14:22
Sometimes you can have a city with multiple tax jurisdictions,

Speaker 1  14:29
but how does that report? How does that like when you go to pay sales tax? Does how does it report itself? Or how does it report? What do you I'm sure it doesn't come up as an other, does it?

Matthias Miller  14:41
I don't know how that works.

Unknown Speaker  14:53
Kind of put your take the space out between your n and your D.

Matthias Miller  14:58
Thank you. Yeah. Yeah, wow, okay, I'm yelling today,

Matthias Miller  15:19
unincorporated Halifax. It's not a city. Let's see. Let's see if it's always just unincorporated,

Matthias Miller  15:34
worst pasture.

Speaker 1  15:38
Do me a favor. Give me that. Give me that that address, that one from William, that had the unincorporated, I want to go search it on texture lookup.

Unknown Speaker  15:59
What? A sales tax. 2237

Unknown Speaker  16:09
birch Elmo Road, 22 birch Elmo birch Elmo

Speaker 1  16:23
so tax char returns at VA, state, Halifax County, South Boston, and then districts. But it doesn't tell me what district. It's telling me that for interesting.

Speaker 1  16:42
But I mean, I like that idea Matthias, I really do like we create a central database and store everything, and I'm assuming you store it with the last known date range, or last date date run, and then if you're within, what would it be 30 days that you would

Matthias Miller  16:58
well, that's what I don't know. I think it depends. In my mind. What makes the most sense is, how often do these jurisdictions publish new rates? And if it you know, most, most times those rates would be published. I

Unknown Speaker  17:15
wouldn't think more than 30 days, would you

Matthias Miller  17:17
that's why I was suggesting calendar month. But yeah, not, not 30 days. Sorry for getting anal and technical, but no understood.

Speaker 1  17:27
I understand what you're saying. But even so, if, if you have a discrepancy on sales tax, and you end up to go to pay and you find yourself under, underpaying, like because of the way that you run sales tax out of a liability account, then you just go get fix it and fix it the next

Matthias Miller  17:43
time. You're not going to know, yeah, really, like we don't. We're just going to file what we thought we should collect and unless, unless we're blatantly out of sorts for extended periods of time, nobody's going to come knocking on our Door. So this is city state, city county, state, other,

Speaker 1  18:28
even at even at 20 even at 500 bucks for 25 pings, 25,000 pings counted as orders. What does that mean?

Unknown Speaker  18:39
Oh, duh. Dubs.

Unknown Speaker  18:48
Oh, I'm

Unknown Speaker  18:52
curious. I'm going to log in and see what we've been paying.

Unknown Speaker  19:05
What this page isn't working seriously, tax jar. Let's

Speaker 1  19:19
look at Avalara is pricing. What does Avalara have for pricing?

Unknown Speaker  19:34
Oh, goodness, there's 1000 different

Speaker 1  20:36
And rock. Ever heard of an rock they can they, they advertise themselves as the number one tax compliance company. Anybody can say that, I

Matthias Miller  20:52
told you about trademark terms, right? Yeah, or were you talking about that? No,

Unknown Speaker  20:58
that was you. Yeah. It

Speaker 1  22:11
All right? Well, I think, I think my to do out of this is to go research which company we want to go and link up with. Do you? Do you have a preference, whether we stick with stripe or whether or with tax jar we go with something else, I don't

Matthias Miller  22:25
think fundamentally makes that much difference.

Speaker 1  22:32
But you, you built you, you kind of specked out the rate or the cash, right?

Matthias Miller  22:37
I mean, that's, yeah, it's very, very loosey goosey.

Speaker 1  22:42
So would, would, would that would Okay, on a per instance basis, would you also have some access? How would like, from a manual standpoint, if you wanted to run this completely manual, like, I don't want to, I don't want to pay for the integration. Well, I guess if we baked it in as part of the price, who cares, right?

Matthias Miller  23:04
Well, that's, well, yeah, but do you want, if people, in a single instance, do you really want to, I mean, I don't know. Maybe. I mean, okay, I'm not your CFO, I'm not charger controller or whatever. I'm not charging your cost control. So if you're good, let's just do it.

Speaker 1  23:31
I wish I had a, I wish I had a handle on on. Okay, let's, let's move this direction for now. I think I need to do a little bit of research and try to get I need to go have a conversation with with an AI platform, and say, Okay, with this concept, how much? How much will it reduce our costs, and how many, like, from a from a perk, from a total contract amount, how many, how many pings can this can you support? Like, in other words, if you, if you ran 1200 pings in a month, how many, from a database standpoint, could that actually support? You know, if you're, if you're, if you're cashing out the information.

Matthias Miller  24:15
Well, the real question is, how many customers out of your 1000, for every 1000 customers, how many of them overlap in the same jurisdiction? And if it's 10% then cashing really gives you not that much 10% savings. If, if 60% you know, are in the same jurisdiction, then well, whoopee, whoop

Speaker 1  24:51
would there be a way? There would be a way I could go run I can, because RTO Pro does seven. Sales. Well, I have to go look, because I think some of our companies are using tax jar and some are not. But if my if we The other option is we just pass the cost on and say, Look, you can either do you can either pay for it, or you can, and here's how it work. Or you can do manual. And if you do manual, then you build your your manual sales tax table. And every time that you go to pay sales tax, you find out whether, whether you're if there's a rate change.

Speaker 1  25:37
Would you? Would you say, we make it some sort of system switch, say, Talk to cash, talk to the main cash, or do it manual. And if it's manual, you just basically have the same table, and you just got to go fill it out yourself.

Matthias Miller  25:52
It would be configured, I don't know exactly how, but on the RTO company, because you're going to have, you might have some people in the well, or, I mean, if you're going to pass the cost on what I'm choosing to let people set up their own texture account, you just put in their API key

Speaker 1  26:08
and use it. I mean, I think we, if someone says, I don't want to pay for it, then, then we, then we give them the, we give them a manual way to do it right, which is, which is basically, you know, I'm assuming some sort of ID for the for this, for the sales tax location, plus city, state, county, and what do you what do you all have? City, county, state and other,

Matthias Miller  26:40
yeah, I mean, but this is you should go research what platform you're going to use. You should research your your whether you're going to pass it on or not, or figure out whether you for sure, whether you want to pass it on or not, and then go from there. How

Matthias Miller  27:01
do we get clear and API information? It's right here. It's just, it

Matthias Miller  27:47
fault, the faults, what it went

Matthias Miller  28:16
10 years ago.

Unknown Speaker  28:19
What's 10 years ago,

Matthias Miller  28:21
their sample code be fine. That's all with

Matthias Miller  29:49
okay. I mean, it looks like Stripe makes you generate the token in the browser itself. I mean. It sounds to me like we Will I

Matthias Miller  31:16
Well, that's not good. I

Speaker 1  31:36
ask your question in regards to explore pay instead of instead of where?

Matthias Miller  32:42
Here we go. Job, script, SCK, SDK, perfect.

Matthias Miller  32:59
So I don't know the full details of this, but

Matthias Miller  33:09
seems like we're good.

Speaker 1  33:11
You mentioned, you mentioned, last week about involving Josh in the in the credit card processing. Do you want me to have a conversation with him?

Matthias Miller  33:22
Let me talk. I would like to talk to Alice first. Well, I don't mind if you do. If you want him involved. I don't mind if you do. I'm also so interested in taking it up, to taking it up with Alice, because I want to know how things are going with Jonathan.

Unknown Speaker  33:44
Should I ask what that meant?

Matthias Miller  33:48
I just want to make sure Jonathan staying on budget with getting done what needs to get done with it within the budget that we'd set.

Speaker 1  33:55
Okay, so Well, I mean, you mentioned it last week. I don't mind having, like, it's, I don't mind having a conversation with him if you think you want to. You know, I don't. I wasn't sure exactly why you mentioned bringing him on board for for this, but, I mean, I know that he's done all the, all the stripe stuff.

Matthias Miller  34:15
Let me be very blunt. Jonathan is a very cheerful Yes, man. He will do anything. He is not a nose to the grindstone. Get stuff done, stay focused. Like I don't know he'd get very easily distracted. And I feel like things can end up taking longer than they need to. And I'm especially with whiskey stuff. I don't know that they want Josh owning it long term. But at the same time, I don't know that I went to pay, you know, I don't know. I'm just mindful of that. That's the basic thing so

Speaker 1  34:50
well, my key concerns when it comes to credit card processing is ease of use, both from a transactional, a refund, a tracking, all of track. Tracking the payout stuff for for accounting like I want to, I want to keep a end user client out of having to jump out of the software to go handle some of this stuff that we currently do directly through stripes portal, because we don't have the functionality over an assist, yeah. So those are, those are the key concerns. I mean,

Unknown Speaker  35:30
well, I

Matthias Miller  35:34
mean, I think those are solvable in some capacity. I I would expect that Josh is the right guy to get it to work, and Johnson's the right guy to make it

Speaker 1  35:44
look pretty all right, so ball in Your court, then to have some conversations around that. Yes,

Matthias Miller  36:00
are we doing anything? Are we playing to do anything, besides any gateway, besides explore, play or clear it?

Speaker 1  36:08
Initially, I don't think so. I mean, at this stage of the game, with this individual that that maybe wants to be a part, coming across from RTO smart over to us, it even in the middle of of, you know, kind of testing phase, there may be, he may want to bring a processor, but he's small enough that I don't know that it's going to be a big deal. Okay, well, and plus, he's coming from RTO smart, so it's like they just handled all the like they baked the processing as part of their, their as part of their their fee. They literally charge 2.9 plus 30 cents per transaction for everything in the system except for payouts or payoffs. Sorry, yep, which I mean, I still kind of blink three times every time I hear that number. I just can't believe that that RTO companies are willing to spend that

Speaker 2  37:10
kind of money, fair. So anyway,

Speaker 1  37:15
I might be wrong. Maybe, maybe, maybe that's a great pricing model. You know exactly I don't know, but at this point, I'd say I know that I've got five companies coming from explore pay. So that's where I want to go first.

Matthias Miller  37:30
Yep, let's do it. I will chase here. Let me go see if

Unknown Speaker  37:40
I see payment.

Matthias Miller  37:43
We just spoke about this email.

Matthias Miller  37:52
Let me do this. I

Unknown Speaker  39:14
okay so?

Matthias Miller  40:03
What next? I'm trying to see how the

Speaker 1  40:05
Explore pay handles settlement process, which means the deposit, the net amount, total minus. Okay, so it looks like explore pay handles there the payouts very similar to the way that stripe does, where they deduct the amount from, well, they deposit the difference between the fees and the dollar value. Credit

Speaker 1  40:35
card companies must have got smart about that. A number of years ago, X charge back in the day, when I was still running RTO stuff, they would literally bill you for the difference. They would deduct it that the charges from your account once a month. Now, credit card companies got smart and said, No, we're just going to deposit difference between the charges and and, you know, the total like you get, you get the difference. We're not gonna, we're not gonna mess around with making sure that you pay your credit card charges.

Unknown Speaker  41:07
Yep. How

Speaker 1  41:11
about you want to talk about, you want to talk about auto pay, sure. And I don't know how complex we want to get with this, but auto pay inside of RTO Pro is basically you just define what day of the month that you want to end the dollar value and and I don't know that we're going to do much different than that. So in other words, you can say, you can say, on the 12th of each month charge X amount. I think you can also do, I think you can also do

Speaker 1  41:49
like multi payments. So you can set up like Multis of it. In other words, like charge 50 bucks on the first and 50 bucks on the 15th and 50 bucks, you know, the 31st or something like that too. I think you can do that as well. So some, some method I want, I want to do, highly flexible. So in other words, you can do, I'm sure you're going to have some ideas around framework on this. I know that some of the, some of the framework, or that that that Josh has on the phone menu, on on repeating stuff is kind of kind of interesting. What's your thoughts on on on repeats, or on on got

Matthias Miller  42:35
some payment plans?

Speaker 1  42:37
Well, no that time frames, like flexibility on time frames.

Matthias Miller  42:49
Well, I mean, I can see it being useful. Say, I get paid in the first and 15th, but can you please make it the Monday after the 15th, or the you know, or the,

Matthias Miller  43:06
oh,

Speaker 1  43:16
I'm gonna go look at the phone menu tree. And I don't know how much of this? How much? How much like, how much of this is like, total custom work versus stuff that's that's already in the platform?

Matthias Miller  43:27
I mean, we can replicate it, but it's not like these types of things don't replicate cleanly from one

Matthias Miller  43:40
you basically end up copying it, so you have to re implement it. But obviously we've got it largely, largely put in there.

Speaker 1  43:51
I mean, because, like, okay, so he has scheduled type one time, daily, weekly, bi weekly, monthly, month, monthly, day of the week, quarterly, annually, nth day. And it's like there's, like, a whole pile of different options. It seems like we could be a little bit more simplistic than that, but I do, what Don Hancock on a Rocket Lawyer? How much? Okay, then come give your opinion on flexibility of auto pay.

Matthias Miller  44:18
I'll trade negotiator

Speaker 1  44:22
man as this, what you I'm grabbing here, this right here, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  44:28
Link containing the documents they

Unknown Speaker  44:32
should come from Rocket Lawyer, double checking just starts in your

Unknown Speaker  44:37
email right here. That's the one view and sign protected documents.

Speaker 3  44:42
They accidentally missed a zero when signing the bond insurance and needed to redo it.

Unknown Speaker  44:47
It's just a zero. Who cares? Zero

Matthias Miller  44:51
is in decibel points. What do they matter?

Unknown Speaker  44:59
I. That's it. That's all I need. That's all you need. You need me for something safe.

Speaker 1  45:06
We're talking about auto pay. How much? How much? What is? How much flexibility do you have an RTO Pro on auto pays right now?

Speaker 3  45:16
What way are you talking payments? I mean, you put in the bank account and set it up for the same

Speaker 1  45:23
just monthly, just monthly, so you don't have, like, like, you can't set up for weekly or so.

Speaker 3  45:31
I would actually have to ask the girls, if that's possible. I'm pretty sure that anything that we do that is not on a monthly basis has to be done manually. Like, we can run a single one time at any time, and so we have some, like, reminders and things from people who did run it weekly. Well, that's dumb. Oh, Christmas,

Speaker 1  45:53
if you if you can have, if we can have, huh?

Unknown Speaker  45:58
Yeah. Um, I

Speaker 3  46:03
think it would be very helpful to have weekly, bi weekly and monthly, not be it

Speaker 1  46:07
so weekly on a certain day of the week, monthly. Wait, you said weekly, bi weekly and monthly? Yeah, I think we could be a little bit more, even more flexible than that.

Speaker 3  46:19
It's not incredibly difficult. Obviously, people who figured out things like Google Calendar, that's ideal when you have the option to say on the X day of every month, or you could say on the, you know, first or third Friday. Like those types of things are great, but I don't like that's not the most critical thing. Oh, yeah. Okay? If you want a role model to look at, look at the all the options in a Google Calendar for reoccurring things. And that's like the best that anybody can offer, really.

Unknown Speaker  46:56
Oh, so what are you saying? It's

Speaker 3  46:59
like if you, if you pick a reoccurring event in a calendar. Okay, okay, so you can do the basics, and then you can go custom, and you could do repeats every three weeks or every five weeks, and repeats on a certain day. She says, replica, replicate, Google Calendar, like, if you got

Speaker 1  47:18
it's actually not that, it's not that, it's not that complex, though. No, it's

Speaker 3  47:22
not complex, but it's like, that type of, that type of flexibility, would be like amazing, but we haven't ever had that, and I don't think anyone else has either. So

Speaker 1  47:38
I like, actually, that's pretty good. The custom, the custom recurrence on on Google Calendar, is probably what we ought to aim for.

Speaker 3  47:47
So it gives you without the custom, it gives you a couple basics. Remember again that three to five rule, three to five things that most people pick from, but then you can use custom and

Unknown Speaker  47:56
day, week, month, year, have a lot

Speaker 3  47:59
of flexibility. I don't think we need year, because,

Speaker 1  48:02
no, no, it would just be day, week and month. Yeah, we don't need year, day, week and month. You

Matthias Miller  48:07
would actually have daily payments. I would have paid two bucks every day.

Unknown Speaker  48:14
I We haven't

Unknown Speaker  48:16
ever done that. I think we just say week, month and year

Speaker 3  48:19
is probably sufficient. The only thing about, sorry, just the reason that you would put day in is not every day, but that you could have the flexibility to say every 20 days, or every 10 days, because that's what the Google Calendar flexibility does by having that that day count.

Speaker 1  48:35
Oh, gotcha. So you could say every, every 10 days, it'll, it'll show up

Speaker 3  48:38
again, like I get paid every two weeks. Well, then you put it on every 14 days. That would be the use case for the day. How do you do every one day? But like, if nobody's going to do that, I don't think

Matthias Miller  48:53
so. How do you make sure that people don't I mean, if you don't do even with bi weekly and bi weekly, how do you make sure nobody accidentally hits the late charge on it?

Speaker 3  49:07
So I'm not sure how this module is working, because I haven't used it, but when the account is set up, there should be the option to either force include the late fee or make it optional, because some states require that it be optional. So when you do something on a reoccurring like that, it should be by state. So like there are certain states that the customer does not have to pay the late fees until they close out the account like you can't mandatorily require them to, so they could pay their account in full and have $1,000 of late fees to pay at the end.

Speaker 1  49:50
But do we do? We do? We want to try and so you just, I see what you're saying. So if there's, if there's late fees on the account, and we're. In a state that

Unknown Speaker  50:01
does it as one of those parameters

Speaker 1  50:03
automatically run the late fees, right? Well, you could, unless the customer asks you not to.

Speaker 3  50:07
So is that kind of like, if the bishop doesn't find out? Like, that's when you get audited, and then you get all kinds of

Unknown Speaker  50:14
trouble, no? And then you say, well, the customer didn't ask me not to. We

Speaker 3  50:17
do I treat everybody to talk about it like this, Hey, so you, you currently owe X amount on your account. Can we take care of that full payment today? We don't say which is late fee, what is their regular amount, whatever. We just say this is what's owed on your account. Can we take care of all of that today?

Speaker 1  50:33
So, so, so what we could do is part of the as part of a reoccurring setup. We could, we could have a checkbox that says, pay, pay late fees or not pay late fees. And if we said, if you set up auto pay, and it says, don't pay late fees, then I'm assuming that would be based on a state that Do we have any states like that?

Unknown Speaker  50:53
Which states,

Speaker 3  50:54
please don't ask me to have all 52 states in my brain. I have a 700 page document I can go reference right now, if you need me to, actually, I think it's 450 pages, but

Speaker 1  51:04
nonetheless, that would be the only time that we would care about paying or not paying late fees. Is, is on an auto pay, whether we auto pay the late fees, right?

Speaker 3  51:22
Okay? But hopefully we could do that in some type of setup for like, by state, just like you are able to choose a contract by state,

Speaker 1  51:32
yeah, but outside of auto pay, I don't know that it that it really matters you're saying bacon in as part of a contract definition, so that it, when you set up auto pay for a customer that's inside

Speaker 3  51:43
of that state, it would automatically take out the diamond dollars. It

Speaker 1  51:47
would auto, it would auto uncheck the pay late fees. Or maybe we only ever show the option to pay yes or no pay the late fees, if, based on the contract definition,

Speaker 3  51:56
I feel like anytime you can bake that type of thing into a setup, you just avoid a lot of human error.

Unknown Speaker  52:14
There anything else? No,

Speaker 3  52:19
no, when do you and how long do you? Matthias plan to run. What's

Unknown Speaker  52:23
your what's your drop off time? Matthias

Matthias Miller  52:28
can go until five.

Unknown Speaker  52:30
Why do you ask? Just because I need

Unknown Speaker  52:33
to get you into the bank sales documents.

Unknown Speaker  52:39
So tell me what time you want us to drop off.

Matthias Miller  52:42
I'm I would honestly be fine dropping on. I mean, I've got tons of stuff to chase, and I feel like the guys still have plenty of stuff to do. If you want to. Yeah, it's up to you. You want

Speaker 1  52:59
to. You want to circle back around to you don't have anything else open this week except for Thursday that are normal, right? Well,

Matthias Miller  53:05
I would have Wednesday, let's see. Remind me your Tuesday time slot in the afternoon.

Speaker 1  53:09
I don't have any opening for Tuesday because going to be in here.

Matthias Miller  53:13
So Wednesday I can do or 1130 to one. Well, I mean, Wednesday is pretty, really, genuinely pretty open after about, actually, I could do as early as 11,

Unknown Speaker  53:30
as long as, as long as we don't have anything by as long as I'm out of, out of the office by 4pm

Matthias Miller  53:39
well, so then let's do, let's do an 11. Let's see how late it takes us. And if you're good with that, I'm good at

Speaker 1  53:50
good with that. So we'll do nothing tomorrow. So let's, let's put, let's put our 11 o'clock on Wednesday to let's, let's nail down all the nuances of auto pay, that'll be fun.

Matthias Miller  54:03
Sweet man,

Speaker 1  54:05
make it. Make a note. Oh, yeah, you handle optional a piece. Okay, you did make a note? Perfect. Yep, all right, so then we're dropping off now and we can go to the bank.

Unknown Speaker  54:16
Cool. See, one day have you dick?
