Speaker 1  00:19
drew all right you got some real light going on there?

Matthias Miller  00:22
Yeah it's called the here's what happens when you lose power because of a snowstorm

Speaker 1  00:27
No kidding. And we're having like the warm weather

Unknown Speaker  00:32
ended our way

Speaker 1  00:34
we've had we had 70 something yesterday and today is a little cooler it's supposed to go down to 20 in the nights or so here in the next couple days but

Unknown Speaker  00:42
wow yep

Unknown Speaker  00:55
All right,

Speaker 1  00:55
so hey, quick question. Where are the settings at for the check per company settings are those on the company thing or isn't that in the My

Matthias Miller  01:09
took a look at that and that one actually is not done after all. Oh, okay. I saw something else come through. I thought I did. Well, let me just make sure I'm pretty sure it would be under the under the it would it's supposed to be under the financial account but I'm pretty sure I mixed it up with something else it would be under your primary checking

Unknown Speaker  01:39
checking

Speaker 1  01:44
I mean there's like in the app hosting zone is that I was looking at this checked by our that's

Matthias Miller  01:58
right everybody share share, share share, where's my share go to chart of accounts guy who in into Edit Account or your account whichever one you go into account signature and you do I mean it's just

Unknown Speaker  02:20
you just push the signature in the space

Matthias Miller  02:23
well you you just adjust the adjust these numbers here. Horizontal and vertical adjustment and then you should be able to save and if you just have a check window open in a new tab you can just refresh keep refreshing that that page to see well if it's if it's an old check if you go to an already printed check and regenerate the PDF you should be able to just keep just refresh that refresh

Unknown Speaker  02:54
okay yep

Matthias Miller  03:11
now we need to signature you wasn't

Matthias Miller  03:27
doing nevermind there's something else. Okay. That's that

Matthias Miller  03:46
what else did we so we had the vendor invoice for at least one.

Unknown Speaker  04:10
Okay

Matthias Miller  04:18
are we good on the contact name for the revenue accounts? Transaction my contact?

Unknown Speaker  04:29
Yes, yes, those were on there. Because I had looked at that while we were in that other meeting.

Matthias Miller  04:37
Good vendor and company mismatch. I think we're good to go on here. See.

Matthias Miller  04:46
Is there anything that you're aware of when this is there anything you wanted to double check or confirm?

Speaker 1  05:07
vendor mismatch No, I did not get to go back and look I mean did all all of those all of those vendors that I sent to you they worked right? Yeah. Okay. So no all that's left there is I just need to pull up that account diagnostics for accounts payable and just see if we have any other issues so that would pretty much just be in my court on yeah seeing if there's any other big problems which I think it's pretty much down to just opening individual ones up and finding random goofs

Matthias Miller  05:59
alright customer deposits report is in review and waiting for feedback from March slash drew as they use it and also should be standard a standard

Matthias Miller  06:37
this one is a

Matthias Miller  06:59
did it

Unknown Speaker  07:15
didn't get assigned

Matthias Miller  07:21
as updates for AR reports waiting feedback from March slash true after using it to standardize later

Matthias Miller  07:39
so, the received not vouchered well that one needs needs some review

Matthias Miller  07:53
this one can be closed out

Matthias Miller  08:03
the SDA or it's pretty the other one. Mark, did you want to talk about the inventory discrepancies now or do you want to do that later?

Speaker 2  08:15
At some point I do want to I mean there's Yeah, we can do it now. Aaron check. Yeah, we didn't check on that this morning. And those numbers are still all we had numbers from as of 1231. So on Monday I had pull numbers as of Monday this Monday I pulled numbers for each of the three districts as well 31 So I compared against that and they were still not matching so I'm not sure if I didn't even dig into the details or.

Unknown Speaker  09:10
Excuse

Unknown Speaker  09:13
me would it be helpful for you to

Speaker 2  09:22
while you while you do that, let me go get the numbers that we I had as of Monday okay

Unknown Speaker  09:43
okay

Unknown Speaker  09:52
okay, so

Matthias Miller  10:00
All right so

Unknown Speaker  10:05
yeah it's a big

Unknown Speaker  10:29
we also set sharp

Matthias Miller  10:43
I just emailed you the list of why those what the inventory should value should be all right i It appears to me okay I appreciate it we try something here Users

Matthias Miller  12:27
okay well there are some I'm now seeing some things excuse me some things that would have affected historical skew lots

Matthias Miller  12:47
so I'm pretty sure I mean next step is going back and cleaning those up so

Speaker 2  12:55
what in a nutshell what happened to the that that changed those

Matthias Miller  13:05
we changed the name on POS, which triggered SKU picks

Unknown Speaker  13:13
he changed vendor names great rename, whatever we call it what

Unknown Speaker  13:18
it was fixing the Great Leap change.

Speaker 2  13:22
Yeah. And so that modifying that brought live a whole bunch of so we end this is maybe too simplistic and approach but what happens at the end of every month is we count all of our we count or inventory and send the numbers to Dwayne's office and usually it's neat children's in his office that goes in and does a manual update on every says as of this day. Here is the here's what the inventory level is like we have no way of just redoing that redoing that like we're resetting ranting, entering I forget what it's called, is it absolute inventory adjustments or there's two types of adjustments Yeah, um

Matthias Miller  14:32
potentially, but I don't know.

Unknown Speaker  14:36
I mean, is that in a lot of ways, I think redoing that would would

Speaker 2  14:52
well, okay, once you're, I'm sure you have a plan on how to do this. I guess what As long as we can fix it, that's all I'm concerned about. So you have a plan, but that's good.

Matthias Miller  15:08
Yeah, I mean, I would be pretty straightforward to fix. Basically, when I don't have to go into the details, but I can find all ski locks. I've listed all schools that were modified because of what I did. And I can go back and pull the old values out of activity history and stuff and back in. And then when, when the school update runs, well, no, this update won't run. And that should bring us back to the original values. And then we should have imagined December 31.

Speaker 2  15:45
Yeah, cuz there's no, right now there's no connection between, say, SKU line, or integer values and account. So this when you make your change that to be live immediately, or changes should reflect. So you're going to go back and see what oh, you know, you modified when you did that change, which is probably all within in a short time period, and then stomp back in the old and that's what, yeah, because we saw a lot of old skillets become active again. It's, yeah, yeah. Good. What, what is the expectation on? timeframe on this?

Matthias Miller  16:42
Well, I mean, it's, before I leave, I don't care whether it's before or after, I think it's up to you, whether you want it before or after, I would have to, I would have to get it cleaned up before I dig into the account balance diagnostic, but I think it's up to you.

Speaker 2  17:03
So that would be here. Is that the top priority that you have? If you do it before, okay, so if you do if you clean up raw materials first, and then what are the other the other items on on your list?

Matthias Miller  17:32
Let me once depreciation comes over, let me pull up your agenda. I think most of the stuff customer deposits is in your court AR is in your court. This is a

Unknown Speaker  17:52
that's done for that.

Matthias Miller  17:58
And then we're down to account balance diagnostic. Raw materials, it's in your court once I fix my stuff, account balance diagnostic, showed drew updating percentages depreciation. And then I guess it would be want to talk through acid

Speaker 2  18:22
purge. Right, we have we have a way to do that. It's just

Speaker 1  18:34
no, we don't. Not even from the okay. You're talking about adding the asset ID on the vendor invoice. Yeah.

Speaker 2  18:42
We don't have a way to go. We

Speaker 1  18:46
have. So the transactions have an asset ID per line item. But so I can only I can only connect things. If if I do it that way, or if I open the vendor, open the asset and create can I even create a vendor invoice from there? Or I can just create transactions from there I think is all that I can do. Well,

Speaker 2  19:17
what about this transaction? If I mean, if a vendor invoice goes through, then you then it's all that's all processes that will create a transaction could you then from the asset

Unknown Speaker  19:28
like just link it on the transaction

Speaker 2  19:31
to the transaction that was created by that by the vendor notes.

Matthias Miller  19:36
You can as long as the transaction doesn't get recreated. But as somebody modifies the vendor invoice somehow the transaction gets recruited, you lose your asset like it's

Unknown Speaker  19:51
so it's not a good

Speaker 1  19:53
well and it doesn't give them away when they're entering.

Speaker 2  19:58
So we're going to have something permission from first of the year to backfill things prior to 1231. We're just going to have a lot like a massive import for Matthias. So no this this should be after your account balance diagnostic reports. Yeah. So I would say, fix the raw materials, then the account balance diagnostics, which applies, which,

Unknown Speaker  20:29
which ones? Is that for receivables deposit forms.

Matthias Miller  20:40
When you think it's those two,

Speaker 2  20:41
those two, do you look at undeposited funds at all? Or should we should we look at this, while we're on the call just?

Matthias Miller  20:50
Well, I have not looked at undeposited funds at all. And so I already know that the vast majority of them are going to be just completely bogus.

Speaker 2  21:09
And they should there should be, especially at the end of the year, there should be very little and I'll be positive funds, like Stripe payments, probably. But as far as something that requires manual, like checks and cash very little, because most of the companies were closed for at least the last week of the year. So I don't know. I mean, it still be kind of interesting to take a quick look at it. While we're on the call. It seems to me like we can safely

Speaker 2  21:53
on that we can safely eliminate any undeposited funds dated prior to even December 1. And then everything that's like we can make that or cut off date if and if it didn't hit undeposited funds before December 1 Then just

Unknown Speaker  22:22
add losses, remember

Unknown Speaker  22:31
5% was 4.3 videos

Unknown Speaker  22:42
like all of those from is there.

Matthias Miller  22:52
And I guess this is what I was saying like these aren't these aren't linked up correctly with the

Speaker 1  23:01
1031 If you go down to the 1010 30 date, remember we had that three and a half million dollar deposit. Like that's where a bunch of these are going to be.

Unknown Speaker  23:16
Right there 1030 There's 30 You're gonna have me there Yeah. Yep.

Speaker 2  23:26
So everything prior to that we can just ignore it, right?

Speaker 1  23:37
I mean, thing is we don't have any record of where it's at anyway, if if, like,

Speaker 2  23:43
Is this too too high level or too? If we just go down to 12 one and just just looked at those? Because everything, it should have such a short life and undeposited funds. What's your thoughts like this? I mean, everything. Everything that hit undeposited funds after December 1 should already have moved out of undeposited funds by now. You have month into them. Oh yeah.

Matthias Miller  24:26
I mean, you have it What's your plan? I mean, you're just going to export to Excel and just add these up, configure what goes where

Speaker 1  24:35
we could just do that. Yeah. I mean, we'll have to be able to look at you know, so whatever doesn't balance what to figure out you know, so if we started talking one we have to figure out what was what was in as of 12 one.

Unknown Speaker  24:53
So I mean, if we had to I mean could we if we throw in a so the latest latest date should be when it when that transaction got positive or what's the latest date?

Matthias Miller  25:28
So I'm missing why don't we just want this to work and make it simpler for ourselves what am I missing?

Unknown Speaker  25:37
We do want to make it simpler first off

Speaker 2  25:40
yep. But how would you do that and advisor What's your

Matthias Miller  25:45
I think your split you split deposits into yeah it's something like me

Unknown Speaker  26:19
you should be able to

Speaker 1  26:21
connect these to a deposit so that like they should fund as part of a deposit

Matthias Miller  26:28
when it comes in when it gets deposited something like this

Unknown Speaker  26:50
buildings

Speaker 2  27:04
what they must not talk to the man

Matthias Miller  27:17
oh come on don't be fussy

Matthias Miller  27:42
maybe not okay well yeah, actually a bunch of them and then here we've got to stripe payout which we're not handling appropriately which might be since 2000 Here's this deposit which probably has miscellaneous items that's why let's fix miscellaneous items

Matthias Miller  28:21
was see assist deposit? See we will have this

Unknown Speaker  28:44
TV

Unknown Speaker  29:49
you Psalm eight okay

Unknown Speaker  30:06
yeah

Matthias Miller  30:16
well, still not I have to figure out what's going on there. But

Matthias Miller  30:24
I mean, even that gets us closer.

Unknown Speaker  30:29
There's gonna be quite a few with miscellaneous items.

Matthias Miller  30:33
Yeah, I mean, if we if we fix miscellaneous items and we get straight payouts to work stripe payouts isn't working because of the difference in Well, we haven't handled them and they've got fees that we need to consider as well but

Matthias Miller  30:56
I don't know maybe maybe I'm maybe it's too much work. But it seems to me like, why wouldn't we just get it to function how we expect it to and let you guys figure it out from there?

Unknown Speaker  31:08
Yeah, I think so.

Matthias Miller  31:18
There's no matching that had been happening earlier. So now we're matching on things like.

Matthias Miller  31:29
Like, deposits need to be breaking, breaking deposits of parts, that that they can link up with the original sales order that they came from breaking stripe payouts. Basically, what's happening is stripe payout comes in as a single line item. Whereas this there's sales order payments that are multiple line items. And so to get the this thing to be able to match them up, we need to break the strike payout into multiple line items, so that they can be paired up appropriately. Same with a deposit. And so we just haven't done the work to support this and to break break big pieces down into little chunks that we can tie them out.

Speaker 2  32:13
The debit is is the payments report. Right? And then the credit is the deposit. So on both sides, depending on the situation is you need to break them down. No, on the debit side, those are all single payment, the debit, you don't need to break

Unknown Speaker  32:34
up or we have a strike fee. Like

Matthias Miller  32:41
in this, in this case, this right payout we're looking for 1912 like this should have this should translate into a credit for 5606 stripe fees and debits for each of the for these two sales orders.

Speaker 2  33:14
Oh, because this is a sales order coming in at the same day. Right.

Matthias Miller  33:21
And then when we break this apart 1334 We should see over here somewhere. Oh, that includes the fees. Oh, well, that's fun.

Matthias Miller  33:37
Whatever the whatever the net amount is.

Speaker 2  33:43
Like the credits can't just or the fees, can we just ignore those? Like, those were never a positive. They just kept that money back like frustrated fees. Shouldn't we just not show that as spreadex? But simply in the example you're looking at just show the 14 1014 never show the 4242?

Matthias Miller  34:12
E? I mean, I think I think that's fair.

Speaker 2  34:19
Yeah. Or you're planning to show the 14 can and the 4242. And they'll just balance each other out. You know, there's

Matthias Miller  34:30
no, I think it should work fine. No, I think what you're proposing would work would actually be correct. But then

Speaker 2  34:37
huge deposits like 113 745 Is that That's the entire deposit. It's not broken down. Okay. So then you're gonna break that down and match that up. Right. He's gonna have a lot of fun with the law. Like how, what about the finance Like with the write off stuff, won't those great how?

Speaker 1  35:09
Well how is the stripe payout? portion? How is that fee portion kicked out? Because essentially, it's gonna be the same.

Speaker 2  35:20
But in some cases we have we get we actually get paid more like a premium. Well, so the way financing works is sometimes it follows the, if the customer has low credit score, depending on what financing company we're using, worth the fact that like stripes than others, it's, it's the exact same amount is, there's no right Oh, and then if the customer has really good credit, then we get a kickback. So we actually get paid a positive right off or retweeted positive, right, and we get paid just like an art to bring it. We don't have a lot of those, but I just probably just being aware of those be

Matthias Miller  36:10
loving it, I think it should just work we're basing it off of the total actually looking to deposit and on the deposit, the deposit would show the total being deposited. And so when we break the deposit out, I mean, I, again, maybe I'm grossly oversimplifying, but I think it should just work. Yeah,

Speaker 1  36:31
I think that should work. Because because that's the portion of the payments that are in the portion of that sales order whenever that you actually are being paid.

Speaker 2  36:43
Oh, it's not looking at what's reported on the sales order, but

Unknown Speaker  36:47
it's okay.

Unknown Speaker  36:52
Sounds good to me.

Unknown Speaker  36:55
So, number one is raw materials and materials, the account balance.

Speaker 2  37:02
Okay, it's with this change. It sounds like receiving that voucher and undeposited funds are kind of two separate projects. Right.

Matthias Miller  37:10
Yes, separate related. So

Speaker 2  37:12
I don't know do we have I probably have a slight inclination to receive that voucher first, just because it seems like that's going to be more fun. More likely on our site, but so that would be to number three would be undeposited funds, and then for what do we have to bore them with something else?

Matthias Miller  37:40
For was the Why am I blinking?

Unknown Speaker  37:45
Was it the asset IDs on vendor and passionate IDs?

Matthias Miller  37:48
Okay.

Speaker 2  37:52
So, should we do should we regroup at three or 330 this afternoon just to see where you're at? Or look at any updates or any questions? Well, there's a good chance we might have some

Unknown Speaker  38:08
see if we can run into something man. Give me just

Unknown Speaker  38:15
330 I think three is too soon.

Matthias Miller  38:18
Three is too soon for me. Unless you guys will have stuff 330 is fine. Let's plan to regroup at 330

Speaker 1  38:24
Well, or what if? What about just tomorrow? Where we was that slot suiting

Unknown Speaker  38:34
tomorrow afternoon thing? Hang on, let me let me share is that that might be too late to get to anything after it then.

Speaker 2  38:41
But But Well, why? Because last year, so if we we can't do the meeting next Thursday. And then Drew's gonna be off the following week. So bait, so really anything to try and hit this goal of closing books. Do you have to be done by next week?

Speaker 1  39:06
Whatever. I mean, I think I'll be in a position where I can. Like, I won't be able to do some big in depth reconcile. But, you know, like, hey, I need these reports. Or, like that kind of thing. I think I'll be able to hit morning or evening. But it's wondering, by and large, though, a lot of the work should be done

Speaker 2  39:30
should be planned out. Have a meeting with Matthias Yeah, either Friday or Monday, Tuesday. I'm a little nervous that if there's enough stuff that's going to come up that we need to do.

Matthias Miller  39:48
So, here's here's the bottom line as well. I was planning to take most or all of the day off tomorrow we'd get spring break and winter. We do just a little bit of stuff as family, but my wife has gotten a good part of the day Saturday or, and so there's a good chance that well between nap times and late late evening that have some chance to work on some stuff than So, so my actual capacity to get stuff done tomorrow is also going to be I'm going to try to get as much stuff done, done today, maybe tonight and do some squeeze stuff in where I can interest and still see if I can hit hit the deadlines that I'm looking for. If I think I mean, we would have some options. Especially, especially towards the beginning, well, up until mid afternoon, you're mid afternoon, on Monday to talk things through Tuesday afternoon, I should probably have some availability. And Wednesday, midday, depending how things go. We could probably we might be able to touch base at the airport, and probably have some time on the flight. If there's some stuff that needs to be chased down. So we do have some obviously, I want to own it sooner rather than later.

Speaker 1  41:35
Monday for noon would work. I would rather be earlier than later because it's going to the closer the more crammed the Alo, I

Unknown Speaker  41:47
would agree. I mean, one day I think it'd be wise to just plan for a time Monday.

Matthias Miller  41:58
How much time should we allow for Monday?

Speaker 2  42:04
90 minutes, maybe? If everything goes really well, we won't need it. But I expect we will need that.

Matthias Miller  42:16
How about we shoot for 730 your time 530 Mine?

Speaker 2  42:25
Set work? Works for me. How does that time? What do you do? Not as well? Not

Speaker 1  42:32
as well. It's It's It's breakfast little children running around the house. Now. If I had just came up here, it would work better. But it's about the most racket in the day that we got at our place.

Unknown Speaker  42:48
If it weren't for you think it would be?

Matthias Miller  42:54
I think I could, like I can bump it later to eat. Well, we want to leave a little margin. That's

Speaker 2  43:03
due Thursday, we need to but don't really don't.

Speaker 1  43:08
I could just, you know, come in here, if I would come up here by 630 or whenever is needed so we can figure out where we're at when we need to discuss. And I would just be up here for that meeting.

Speaker 2  43:27
That time would work. Well then, if you're okay with that drive it. Yeah, I

Speaker 1  43:31
mean, it's just for me to have a meeting at home at that time of morning doesn't really work. So

Speaker 2  43:36
that was Monday. 730 tonight.

Matthias Miller  43:41
Okay, I'll do that. Sending you the invite. Now. DREW? Yeah. Alright. So in, and I'll, I'll let you know. I guess feel? How about we do it like this. Feel free to call this afternoon if you guys have questions before end of day. And I will keep you posted on what I've got. And I would probably I don't know, it's a tug of war here who wins what? Andy Stanley says you're always cheating from somewhere. So where are you going to cheat from? But I think my preference would be as much as possible to keep if I have something that I feel like works and gets most of the way to communicate by email and work a bit asynchronously until Monday morning and then Monday morning dive in and grab what we sink our teeth into it. But let me let me let me see a little bit about what as far as tomorrow afternoon, afternoon what our plans specifically are it's okay, we're do

Speaker 2  44:56
the 330 call only if we have some questions that come otherwise we we do not do the 330 all the day. Right? Correct. And then regroup on

Speaker 1  45:09
anything that you're updating. Will that, given your schedule? Will that be? Will that update be pushed live tonight or tomorrow night? Or what were you thinking?

Matthias Miller  45:24
We were going for last night. And that didn't happen. I mean, most of my stuff is going to be user reports. So there's really nothing for me that they okay. Yeah. There's some other changes that are waiting on an update. Yeah. I'm not aware of anything. If it's all the same. I might just wait for Josh to update on Saturday. I guess there's something that you specifically need for tomorrow. I'm not. I'm not thinking of anything offhand.

Speaker 1  45:54
No, if it doesn't include these user reports, and it should be fine.

Speaker 2  45:58
So is the GAO report a user report as well? The changes so AR and cost deposits are both used. Okay.

Matthias Miller  46:09
Good. Good. Okay, awesome.

Unknown Speaker  46:16
Thank you. Enjoy the snowstorm.

Matthias Miller  46:19
We'll do, only do it move on to another lesson till then. Sounds good.

Unknown Speaker  46:26
Thank you. Thanks.
