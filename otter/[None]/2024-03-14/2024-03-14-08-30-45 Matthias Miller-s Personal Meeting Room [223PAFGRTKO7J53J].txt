Unknown Speaker  00:05
Oops How are you doing this morning? Good

Matthias Miller  00:21
a to both of you hey good morning Joel. Oh back

Speaker 1  00:26
I'm not hearing anything and let me see if I can figure out why

Matthias Miller  00:33
I'm testing about now okay,

Unknown Speaker  00:37
yeah that's better cool

Matthias Miller  00:54
yeah, a load of stuff. Okay, when times

Speaker 1  01:04
well and I'm coming in completely cold here.

Matthias Miller  01:08
So are you pass your jetlag or is it like still like no

Unknown Speaker  01:16
I woke up at three this morning

Matthias Miller  01:26
I was up around them but it wasn't jetlag.

Unknown Speaker  01:33
Yeah sorry

Speaker 2  02:03
would it make sense to go through all the closing books tasks on their own as a chunk?

Matthias Miller  02:10
Yeah, I think so. Okay, I don't think any of those would actually involve Joel okay

Speaker 2  02:29
well if I remember then I could filter out

Unknown Speaker  02:38
the income statement

Unknown Speaker  02:42
a gentleman

Speaker 3  02:44
like maybe five hours so not that far, but it's not necessarily reconciled then you know?

Unknown Speaker  03:12
Hey, Drew Mark Hello

Unknown Speaker  03:18
This must be a good day if we get to talk to you again you're

Speaker 1  03:25
I have to confess though you're talking to about half of me. The other half is I don't know somewhere in the air between here in Bangladesh.

Unknown Speaker  03:39
I'll say you're still in Bangladesh, right?

Speaker 1  03:41
No, I I'm actually back in the States but my body still thinks I'm somewhere between the two.

Speaker 4  03:53
So how much of a time what is the time difference between here and there?

Speaker 1  03:57
Between Central and Bangladesh time it's a dozen time zones so you're on Eastern right yeah, yeah. So you live in but

Speaker 4  04:11
so when you want to talk to your team over there it's when do you talk to them like I'm

Speaker 1  04:19
often will either talk with them in their evening so you know nine or 10pm their time or you at five their time and I get up at five or six? My time? Yeah.

Speaker 4  04:42
But what do you miss most about? Not being there anymore.

Unknown Speaker  04:49
In person interactions, good food

Unknown Speaker  04:59
Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  04:59
Yeah.

Speaker 4  05:04
So you said, What language do you communicate? And did you learn their language? Or did they learn English?

Unknown Speaker  05:12
Yes. So I do have a decent level of Bangla but, but generally the office English is sort of the default language. Unless I mean if you know if we're talking among themselves, it might be one way or it might be another depending on the situation.

Unknown Speaker  05:43
So yeah

Unknown Speaker  05:54
well,

Unknown Speaker  05:56
is driving here

Unknown Speaker  05:59
while yours all

Speaker 2  06:01
right, it's time to get started with updates. So I've split out for hopefully the sake of clarity. I filtered out everything having to do with the closing books for 2023. And we can talk about that after we go through our other list if that works for everybody else. So I assume that document procedure for closing books through 2023 is done. Is that complete? is now we have a list documenting how we're going to do it.

Unknown Speaker  06:34
Probably spill tea so yeah,

Speaker 4  06:35
I think that's, I don't feel like yeah, that's good. Okay, sounds

Speaker 2  06:40
good. All right. So for Drew we have the track reconciliation by statement or the reconciliation event log. Thanks. Still working for looking for confirmation that it's working correctly. As of last stage, um,

Speaker 3  06:56
I mean, working correctly, we could say that it's satisfactory, but it really could use some refining I don't know that we need to work on refining it now.

Matthias Miller  07:10
Can you pump this out? mid April?

Unknown Speaker  07:12
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Okay. We'll talk about what it means

Matthias Miller  07:22
Sure. Okay, to I've been doing that Mark actually use the right month this time. Trust.

Unknown Speaker  07:34
I thought about that.

Speaker 2  07:39
Good and hard to keep track. All right. Messiah closing process for a county impact. No change. Okay. Drew ad budget columns to income statement.

Unknown Speaker  07:53
Oh, no change. Hey, Matthias

Speaker 2  07:56
create process for moving payments from one sales order to another. Let's

Matthias Miller  08:01
be honest with ourselves moving.

Speaker 2  08:10
about handling historically reconciled transactions.

Matthias Miller  08:15
mostly done, but we should rerun this with all the stuff that I've done in here. We could do for Monday. Okay.

Speaker 2  08:30
Yeah, this coming Monday. So that'd be Okay. Sounds good. Popped up again. Again, with I show ending banks or credit card balance for pending items.

Matthias Miller  08:46
We just talk it through and we're at, I don't Well, I think we still need to talk through exactly what this looks like. I, my proposal would be to table at the beginning of April. But Drew, do you have feedback on that?

Unknown Speaker  09:02
That's fine. In fact, it doesn't even have to be the beginning of April.

Matthias Miller  09:05
mid April, then just throw everything in there. And we can triage closer

Speaker 3  09:19
Yep, backing up to the budget columns. Is that is that simply just checking it budget columns are present or something particular about them?

Speaker 2  09:31
Let's see. My last note was well, I'm not sure exactly is it? Is it just the fact that the columns are there?

Unknown Speaker  09:44
So I mean, the columns are there.

Unknown Speaker  09:46
You've tested that Yeah, yeah, I

Speaker 3  09:49
know that there but I didn't. I didn't like go through and find out if they you know if they match on various arrangements.

Speaker 4  09:59
but we have not added budget numbers yet

Speaker 3  10:04
right? As far as Oh like I can tell the provisions there but there's not really any information so I can't You can't

Speaker 4  10:17
should we after we go through the the updates have Joel just give them a quick tour of the

Matthias Miller  10:25
setup or maybe do you do you want are you guys doing budget as part of your financials push as part of our what you're part of your financial squish

Speaker 4  10:42
not part of that one of the Affordable Learning company they have a goal to have their budget numbers entered by end of the month so which will be pretty straightforward but yeah, if we could just have a quick tour with Joel I think that would be all

Unknown Speaker  11:00
okay. But uh, I tagged it for agenda Okay, great. Okay, Matthias validate or vendor invoices validate against unlinked ledger accounts.

Matthias Miller  11:15
No change.

Speaker 2  11:17
Okay. How about credit memos

Matthias Miller  11:23
no change I think I think this one needs to move out to at least at least April 1 At a minimum and I think validate against Emily ledger accounts probably the same way

Unknown Speaker  11:49
okay

Unknown Speaker  11:54
sales order accessory

Matthias Miller  11:59
you bought the comment? Yeah, let's see

Matthias Miller  12:10
this wait until April. Welcome drew this just needs to be done before then.

Unknown Speaker  12:18
It's not isn't this order? What

Matthias Miller  12:19
is this

Speaker 4  12:20
this is that we're like miscellaneous invoices where we take for building materials sales if something were to keep falling too but they're broken out. Or

Speaker 3  12:34
that got pushed over this is the fix to make so we can go back to the

Matthias Miller  12:38
whole approval plague Right? Correct. Yeah,

Speaker 4  12:43
push it out. But as it sits now the fix we've made respect whatever account we select right?

Matthias Miller  12:51
Yes. Okay, so So now now you can select the account but there's no approval process and this will bring the approval process back in okay let's move this to mid April

Unknown Speaker  12:58
yeah good

Speaker 2  13:06
it says in the Transaction Search add a column for the general ledger accounts see if any and

Matthias Miller  13:11
mid April

Unknown Speaker  13:14
okay

Speaker 2  13:20
drew transaction by contact change request ticket was pending an update last week,

Matthias Miller  13:28
which on the seven seven last update was it should be live waiting for Drew's combination.

Speaker 2  13:45
Endrew have you I assume you haven't had a chance to look at that yet then.

Speaker 3  13:51
Is this the Is this the update about the receipt not vouchered? I don't

Matthias Miller  13:57
know this is the transaction by contact report.

Speaker 3  14:04
Right about how it lists the receiver Lautrec. Oh, revenue, the contact names and the revenue oh, maybe

Matthias Miller  14:18
that's something else? Yeah. Three, six. Yep, there is a chance to link POS to the vendor instead of the billing company

Matthias Miller  14:45
I think this I think it should be live. look better than this. Well, this

Speaker 3  14:52
is what I've written out for you this morning and it wasn't

Unknown Speaker  14:59
it wasn't on a revenue

Unknown Speaker  15:01
No it was not on revenue

Speaker 4  15:05
Isn't this what we wanted the same things apply for or received that vouchered as

Speaker 3  15:16
Yeah, I think so. I mean it wasn't receiving a voucher but it was it was the items that that are in received voucher defecting that account

Matthias Miller  15:28
can we add this to the agenda to circle back to it? Yeah yeah yeah

Unknown Speaker  15:44
all right. block out time for the Go Live plan mark. Does that also complete

Speaker 4  15:57
but so so we're just saying just to block out time to work on those right.

Unknown Speaker  16:00
Yeah, I think so. I think that was the journey Yeah, it

Unknown Speaker  16:04
is underway. So we consider this

Speaker 2  16:08
Okay, great. All right, Matthias we had this for Jonathan the allow company specific signature adjustments might have gotten an email update here. See

Matthias Miller  16:20
when rather than seeing these Yeah, that should be live. Okay. So that's it for your support to configure

Unknown Speaker  16:32
Okay

Speaker 2  16:39
then we have support for importing transaction line items

Matthias Miller  16:45
pending an update well update plus review that's in my course. I think I think bump it out to April 1

Speaker 4  16:58
Okay, is that I think we'll call it on my lathe today is that for the payroll in part one

Unknown Speaker  17:11
okay

Speaker 2  17:16
I'm Matthias add the faults general ledger accounts to standard employees report.

Matthias Miller  17:20
That's why waiting for I don't know

Unknown Speaker  17:30
did you say this is live?

Matthias Miller  17:31
Yes, it is.

Speaker 4  17:33
I say just make a note for I'll have Aaron verified this. Yeah, you can put my you can put my name on a disk verified. Okay. Great.

Speaker 2  17:54
Okay, great. Um, nothing is handling historically reconcile transactions?

Matthias Miller  17:59
Still have nothing? Actually. Yeah, we

Speaker 2  18:02
push that out. Okay. Show company name on balance sheet. Jonathan.

Matthias Miller  18:11
Wait, and see if we have this year

Matthias Miller  18:23
going to 27 minute one should have been that one should have been live for a good bit. Okay. That's really missed it.

Unknown Speaker  18:32
I'm pulling on up right now.

Unknown Speaker  18:41
Sure, that's

Unknown Speaker  18:43
okay. Just because they

Unknown Speaker  18:47
didn't, I'm thinking so I'd come through

Unknown Speaker  19:11
Are we still checking to see if it's done? Are we saying it's done?

Unknown Speaker  19:16
Oh, I'm still loading. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  19:18
No, no, that's fine. I got distracted for a second.

Speaker 4  19:26
The next one. We can look, there's no change on that. But I'd say later. 21st. That's good. Great.

Speaker 2  19:33
Sounds good. And then we have a new one for Matthias. The income statement for pole barn. Rev and cogs.

Unknown Speaker  19:42
Yeah,

Speaker 2  19:43
march 25. is the date that I captured for that. Is that still what we're shooting for?

Matthias Miller  19:47
Can we I mean, I'm gonna have to get it done by hopefully by Monday if it's gonna, well. We're getting one to two weeks. We'll probably have to be done like, at least next revision by Monday. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  20:00
back up there.

Speaker 4  20:05
So Matthias, what are you is what you're doing? They're just the initial, give us a way to filter based on that, like DLR

Matthias Miller  20:15
where we can

Unknown Speaker  20:20
is it just a filter revenue and based on so

Matthias Miller  20:30
it's gonna be a user report just for them just for now band aid based on the dealer's

Speaker 4  20:41
data report based on dealer so you could you can say give me income statements will it be like give me an income statement, irregular income statement or an income statement? Only for this one deal or these three years?

Matthias Miller  20:58
There'll be probably not a way to do a normal income statement you can do that through the standard means but for this when do we have to? We'll all will all the buildings have a sales order? Yeah, the duty to Okay. So it's it'll probably just be selecting one or more dealers on this specific show me. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  21:28
And you have that dated for what Monday?

Matthias Miller  21:32
Yes. I mean, if it's not Monday, we will we will have a turnaround within one to two weeks. With me being out. Okay. It's still soft. Everything else? But overshooting.

Speaker 4  21:51
You told me but what are the what is it? timeframe? You're out?

Matthias Miller  21:57
I'm going to be so I'm traveling on Monday on Wednesday. So depending on my travel schedule, I might have some time then. And then I'm going to be out. Thursday and Friday. Exactly the following Monday.

Speaker 4  22:13
Oh, okay. So you'd be out on a 20th through the 23rd. Yes. Okay, then you're then Drew's off the next week so

Matthias Miller  22:28
correct.

Unknown Speaker  22:31
We're working together well, are we

Matthias Miller  22:36
I mean, I might my days aren't going to be super packed. So I'm not making any promises but there's at least a probably greater than, well, there's a greater than zero probability that I'll have some availability without without making that making bold promises.

Speaker 3  22:55
That's kind of how I'll be for my week to it you want to go back to the balance sheet and and click that as as complete you can

Unknown Speaker  23:09
perfect

Speaker 2  23:11
okay, well we got through March. So let me see what we have that is undated the draft transactions appearing and reconcile with Iris.

Matthias Miller  23:22
Joe, I don't know if you want to do this here, it would be helpful to understand might be easier than answering the email conceptually. What's the purpose of direct transactions and how do we think of them in the accounting systems

Speaker 1  23:37
so in one or two sentences basically the difference between draft and posted is is a way to lock in to lock down transactions so once the transaction is posted then you need the Edit posted transactions permission to edit at least significant aspects of the transaction

Matthias Miller  24:17
so it's it's less of a win I think it was draft I think of

Matthias Miller  24:29
maybe it's just how I think of grass. I think you've drafted it's not real yet but it's about to be real. But it's going to be real at some point. And instead it's a this is real, but it's not set in stone. Right. Okay.

Matthias Miller  24:52
Okay, which, which is the same way we think of draft invoices as well for the standard Invoice module.

Speaker 2  25:02
Does anything actually need to be done with this besides the discussion?

Matthias Miller  25:08
No, through the bottom line is that we do intend draft transaction to appear and reconciled. Yeah. And then you just wouldn't be able to modify reconciled transactions by virtue of the fact that it's reconciled or at least not that line item by virtue of being reconciled. Right.

Speaker 3  25:30
So So could we would we in a sense, then anything that gets reconciled that is in draft would automatically be switched to posted? Because of the reconcile process like So that said, those draft items get updated and they'll stay sitting as a draft? Or should that not be

Speaker 4  25:54
would it be helpful for Joel to see why they came up in the first place? Or maybe he's aware of that like in the notifications on the system, they were popping up this last draft? Like

Speaker 3  26:05
it was just saying there's a lot of draft transactions a lot I wasn't paying attention for

Matthias Miller  26:17
sure. We switched the configuration not to default it is posted instead of draft and so we sidestep the issue. Okay, I don't know that much. Further needs to be done. Well, okay, so there's two things the idealistic world perhaps ideally in an idealistic world, we have some better clarification so that next time somebody uses the accounting system we don't have this confusion. The practical side is if you guys in your accounting system have some kind of draft slash posting, like submit a draft review process that we like the builder verification you can also switch it from draft to posted right

Speaker 3  27:16
yeah, it does what we were we were running into was it was stuff that I just created as transactions not stuff pushed over I think what was pushed over from accounting was generally being as posted.

Matthias Miller  27:30
Right, but don't we have a process by which the the, the which district manager somebody has to ask to approve non automatic transactions is that did that never happen?

Speaker 4  27:46
Non automatic transactions are you talking about sales orders ready to invoice or invoices to be paid?

Matthias Miller  27:56
No, I thought it was I thought there was going I think we had at one point talked about a separate verification process

Speaker 4  28:05
on our drawers or distributions or something like that. Yeah, anything that's not that never I'm not aware of that that ever happen and I don't at this point there there seems to be no need for it

Matthias Miller  28:22
I mean my inclination with this whole thing Maybe I'm being too heavy handed and fast moving or whatever, but can we just table the draft conversation since you guys aren't using it? And then he goes do decide you want it we can come back to it

Speaker 3  28:42
Yeah, I think so. Good. I mean I don't know whether it be practicality of incorporating this feature in with the whole locking down you know, I mean, in some ways this is a this is a closing of transactions for some users maybe once we look at that when we come back to this to

Matthias Miller  29:10
well, most users won't even be able to modify transactions at all. I mean, most of the modifications happen through vendor invoice records etc For sure

Unknown Speaker  29:24
Yeah. Table

Matthias Miller  29:27
Can we can we completely remove contracts transactions from the system just as an option that fine rather than than just changing the default just disable it? The feature

Speaker 3  29:43
log is everything that is draft currently and will get switched.

Matthias Miller  29:52
I'm pretty sure that everything transaction

Unknown Speaker  29:57
to him are you addressing that question now? All right.

Matthias Miller  30:00
Well, we have we have a system switch so I think it's a question for Drew. Okay. Switch I did not know we had until I started digging into this.

Speaker 1  30:14
I wouldn't have been able to tell you that either.

Unknown Speaker  30:38
So, is that an action item that you want to take?

Matthias Miller  30:42
I'm going to you can keep rolling. I'm just going to do now. Mark, this is done. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  30:48
Mark, this particular task is done. We're good with it.

Unknown Speaker  30:53
Right? No, not the wrong one.

Matthias Miller  30:57
Draft address objections when?

Unknown Speaker  30:58
Nope. Yep, I see it.

Matthias Miller  31:02
Doo doo. Okay, gotcha.

Speaker 2  31:05
Thank you. All right. Next one. report showing customer deposits. There we go.

Matthias Miller  31:14
On the it's on the agenda to talk about today, okay.

Unknown Speaker  31:21
We don't have any date range until you talk about it.

Matthias Miller  31:25
That's due today, I think.

Speaker 2  31:32
Make it easy. Okay. Um, how about Add View checks link to vendor invoice.

Matthias Miller  31:41
What's the this is something Patrick can do with me let me quick find it and send it over to him.

Unknown Speaker  31:59
There you delegating it to

Matthias Miller  32:02
Tarik T AR IQ. Okay. We're here's his. Oh, yeah. Edie would be fine.

Unknown Speaker  32:12
Oh, btw. Okay. Let's do that. Okay. Um, date?

Matthias Miller  32:24
Oh, I don't know. And, and the month

Unknown Speaker  32:31
changes for labor intensive buildings.

Matthias Miller  32:36
Marketing question of priority for this. That tiny gender

Speaker 4  32:44
I mean, is it this doesn't take require a lot of work, does it? I know. A lot of work in so

Matthias Miller  32:56
it's probably me, not anybody else.

Unknown Speaker  33:02
I would say mid April.

Unknown Speaker  33:08
Okay. Sounds good.

Matthias Miller  33:09
Man. April's absolutely doable. Questions that needs to be done in my chest.

Unknown Speaker  33:18
Okay, mid April.

Speaker 2  33:21
Okay. Thursday afternoon check in meetings. I didn't hear from anybody if you wanted to keep this 1pm mountain time or I guess 3pm Eastern Time assist check in meeting on Thursdays on the calendar, given our new schedule. Does anybody have any thoughts about that?

Speaker 4  33:40
I'm inclined to say we want to keep it on the schedule for right now. Just at least the next few weeks just because like today, I expect we will cover some things and then I kind of want to come back with some more things afternoon.

Speaker 2  33:57
Okay, sounds good to me. That's all I Okay, so you want to switch over to the closing books tasks?

Matthias Miller  34:05
One question about today's schedule or specifically. Do you

Matthias Miller  34:24
guys want me to keep that 3pm open for today. Especially with me being me

Speaker 4  34:30
for the day is does that work for you? Or

Matthias Miller  34:33
like yeah, that can work. Yeah, that's good.

Unknown Speaker  34:37
Keep it open for today.

Matthias Miller  34:41
And then yeah, I was planning then to be out tomorrow. So probably not ideal. But if I should, it should. I mean I can I can see what I She's artists, whereas meeting sometime in the afternoon, if if you guys think that would be beneficial given the time, well, given the timeframe, I'm not quite sure how to how to weigh the options here.

Speaker 4  35:13
Well, I would say, let's see. Can you look at how far we get today with this and then see if we still need

Matthias Miller  35:22
it. Okay. Okay. And I might, I might also be willing to do it fairly early Monday morning, if necessary, early for me. Not your early things, keep things moving once they're faster. Cool.

Speaker 2  35:42
Okay, sounds good. So these are just the transactions that are tagged as closing books for 2023. So the dates that I had I put on and the dates that I didn't I just put on for March 28. So that's what we're looking at at the moment, we can fix things as needed. So the vendor and company mismatch due yesterday? Theoretically?

Matthias Miller  36:06
Yeah. I mean, I think I've done my part. Okay, I think I've created a big enough mess. And I think I've cleaned up, clean it all up, mark your inventory levels to be back to where they should be, like closer to where they should be.

Speaker 4  36:20
I do have a note on that. We checked it this morning. And they're they're not so at the end of the meeting. I think we want to look at that.

Speaker 2  36:28
Okay, that's that on the agenda. Okay, how about customer deposits, business is created, create a report for customer deposits

Matthias Miller  36:37
on the agenda to review today. Sounds good.

Speaker 2  36:46
Add as of date function to AR reports.

Matthias Miller  36:51
I think for review, we've got to use the report. But for you.

Unknown Speaker  36:56
Okay, so I drew.

Speaker 4  36:58
Pretty much all of these items are on the should be on the agenda for review today.

Matthias Miller  37:06
What is it even worth going? I guess I wonder how much of this is actually worth going through. Some of these might be done. Like showing Drew was to use percentage numbers, that one is done. From the bottom there.

Unknown Speaker  37:31
You send the link for that or something? Oh,

Matthias Miller  37:34
not done?

Matthias Miller  37:43
Yeah, I think there's enough stuff in flux here. Um, I think we should just, if you want to send me the link, I can I can try to take either take notes or record the portion of the caller. I'll try to take notes. Yeah, sure.

Speaker 2  37:57
I mean, I, let's see, do I have agenda items all showing up for me now. I'll send you the link to the agenda item list and everything will be in there. If that helps you? Yep. Great. Okay. Well, I can let you guys continue on with your meeting then. As per usual, I'm great meeting. Thanks.

Matthias Miller  38:21
All right. Walk through what was the budget walkthrough? Drew junuh. Share your screen and go walk them through the budget. Sure. And while you guys are doing this, I might listen in and heading the opposite. That's good.

Unknown Speaker  38:53
All right.

Unknown Speaker  39:02
Okay, sure.

Speaker 3  39:21
I mean, this is, I guess you wanted to go from the income statement side?

Speaker 1  39:27
Well, I guess it depends what you're after. So, do you have accounts with budgets entered on them right now?

Speaker 4  39:40
We don't know. I just like to know, what's there what we need to know for both on the income statement and your budget versus the expense report? I believe he's created two reports.

Speaker 1  39:53
Yes, that's correct. So maybe if you want to pull up another tab Well, this loads for your chart of accounts

Unknown Speaker  40:14
is this on your chart of accounts? Is this where you said

Unknown Speaker  40:19
no budget numbers there?

Speaker 1  40:21
Yeah. Okay, so Okay, good. Should

Unknown Speaker  40:24
we look at where to enter budget? No. Yeah.

Speaker 1  40:27
So on who's running so that is on the account detail so if you buy

Speaker 4  40:41
okay are we We're now looking at the chart of accounts are you wanting to show us here what when we have to set where we set net or gross

Speaker 1  40:54
Yes, that's that's one aspect although this is I believe this is also where you actually enter the budget numbers as

Speaker 4  41:02
well. So do let's just go to Yeah, like advertising I think that's one we're going to read the 62 average advertising and lead generation let's just enter some some numbers there.

Unknown Speaker  41:19
Okay. Whose budget? Yeah.

Speaker 4  41:23
No, okay. Okay, so gross amounts I think we said we wanted to use gross amounts pretty much everywhere except for like, capex purchases or like property plant and equipment right? What what are we where are we might we just want to track capex purchases, but don't want like we say we were budgeting 150,000 on this year and if we sell a forklift it would be a sale of assets so we don't want to if we want to exploit that we select grows.

Speaker 1  42:14
Right right. Right. So okay, so am I understanding correctly? You'd like gross on stuff like capital like your capital accounts, but but not on on others?

Speaker 4  42:32
But I think it's Yeah, mainly on the balance sheet like property plant and equipment or Sure sure. Purchases Yeah, sure. Sure.

Unknown Speaker  42:47
You might just need to refresh here Okay, there we are

Speaker 1  43:07
okay, and you'll need to hit enter budget here in the upper right okay so right so if you enter a number there it'll spread it

Speaker 1  43:31
or then you can edit specific months if you wish we will February

Unknown Speaker  43:36
more

Speaker 1  43:46
interesting. Is not updated. Okay. But oh,

Speaker 3  43:54
so it's still would take this as the

Unknown Speaker  43:59
interesting yeah. What

Speaker 4  44:01
what what would have happened through it you put in 60,000. Then you said oh, I want to change all those two lines and then you got rid of the 60,000. With the other numbers, it stayed.

Speaker 3  44:13
Okay, so what we could do is we want to put in 60 here

Matthias Miller  44:23
six here, six here and 62 here.

Unknown Speaker  44:32
Which what will happen now changes Oh.

Speaker 4  44:38
It's so the file. I mean, should we just we talked with Matthias about doing like a File Import will have a file for like eight or 10 accounts with my month. Import is that should we just plan And to do that, and then

Speaker 1  45:02
that would be simple enough. I mean, the, the monthly budget amounts really are the core here. The, the 12 month is, is for convenience of entry essentially.

Speaker 3  45:19
So quick so there's just be a switch backwards, like,

Speaker 1  45:22
just calculate so that the months drive the. Yeah, the 12 month. Yeah.

Speaker 4  45:28
each one individually, like in this case. Okay. So you know what you need to know when you want if we want to edit something, or change something?

Speaker 3  45:42
Well, I mean, no, we can't. Okay, yeah. Yeah, that would work. I mean, like let's let's say this month is zero. This month is six

Speaker 4  46:04
when did I just do drag it to the to April, you had it highlighted in March

Speaker 4  46:19
we'll need to be able to change budget numbers to match actual

Unknown Speaker  46:24
No. Oh, as if

Unknown Speaker  46:27
we're running off. We just changed our budget there you go. I'd be defeating the purpose.

Speaker 3  46:41
So yeah, I mean, we can change we can change those individual numbers to whatever we want. We just have to have this be the total you know, if we say okay, we don't want anything here. Oh, that changes that total.

Unknown Speaker  46:59
Oh, interesting.

Matthias Miller  47:13
appears like so.

Speaker 3  47:16
So we can go through and just enter our monthly amounts, and it will drive that and just simply create a total where it is.

Speaker 1  47:29
Ah, as you enter as you entered the last number, then yeah, I guess.

Speaker 4  47:39
And you can only enter budget amounts on child accounts. You can't enter it on parent accounts. Correct.

Matthias Miller  47:49
Um I believe that's right. At least we won't I think that is right. Well, yeah, it'd be interesting to check that. Why don't we just get that deal? We're gonna like does that another deal ago?

Speaker 1  48:23
Yeah, you might just need to head back a couple of rounds

Unknown Speaker  48:36
here would be one.

Speaker 1  48:43
Okay, well, the allowing me to we that's a bit of a whole I believe for comparison purposes, we will assemble it from the children. But it doesn't really make sense that we're allowing you to, to enter it here. Let me make a note of that.

Speaker 3  49:12
Oh, okay. It's bringing me the three child accounts. Oh, okay. That's, well, that's brilliant. They're even better. Yeah. Okay. So, I mean, I'm assuming, but I probably can't put anything in here. Oh,

Speaker 1  49:34
let's see. Again. I don't think you should be able to but

Speaker 3  49:39
just don't go there. Live here and go here. But I can't go

Speaker 1  49:44
there. Okay, but it does not allow Okay, okay. Well, cool. That's great. Looks like the initial build was smarter than I was thinking.

Speaker 3  49:58
Well, I would say that's all we need to know that Is No. Yeah.

Speaker 4  50:03
Well, we'll still plan for the initial upload to just send it any file to Matthias and have him sure. Do the uploads yeah

Speaker 4  50:17
cool oh, the the other report we wanted to look at was the budget versus actual because we have their accounts on the balance sheet

Unknown Speaker  50:37
budget comparisons, right.

Unknown Speaker  50:40
Yes, I believe so. And just just noting, I can't currently see your screen so

Speaker 1  51:04
now, do you currently have one one account with? With the US budget check, right?

Speaker 3  51:20
Yeah, thanks. So, yeah, we didn't put anything in on it. Right? No, no,

Speaker 4  51:28
don't what is the link to acid? What's the intent of that? Like?

Unknown Speaker  51:36
That's a standard prompt.

Unknown Speaker  51:39
Just ignore it. Yeah.

Speaker 4  51:47
Okay, and budget comparison, as of April, Will it always be the different data or you have the option with start and end dates and Okay. Mate, I don't know why arranged year to date is about the only way you look at it everything. Sure.

Speaker 3  52:19
Yeah, so those two are the ones that we checked, but we didn't put any budget amounts in

Unknown Speaker  52:25
your head. Sure. So it'll still the

Unknown Speaker  52:27
two columns, but it won't show the difference right. Right.

Speaker 4  52:37
And Will Will the report when you print it off, it would show expense the net amounts are like the account type and the

Matthias Miller  52:44
budget tag so

Speaker 1  52:47
so it does right now. However I'd say we can change that to whatever you your preference is.

Speaker 4  53:00
And these will be assembled in order of the chart of accounts.

Unknown Speaker  53:06
I believe that's right.

Speaker 4  53:07
Okay. So I would say remove this is not urgent but remove the account type remove the budget type and include in instead include a difference or variants are probably here I don't know that we percentage know just just the difference between actual and budget but yeah, good excellent. I think so. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  54:10
Anything else for Joel?

Speaker 4  54:20
Maybe this, this is the Joel, the number six on my list where we noticed that the income statement numbers differ when you show or hide the account numbers. Matthias, we believe this is what we had those custom cogs we looked at last week and it looked like it was all working and then end it end it is when you show the account numbers but when you suppress the account numbers, then it doesn't show cost and cost of goods. I don't know is that a setting on? Maybe you check that too is the setting on the chart of accounts that takes better

Unknown Speaker  55:00
so disturbing

Speaker 4  55:03
if you look at what is the it's something like 50.1 20 I think so yeah like that's one account where when you suppress the account numbers you don't see it

Speaker 1  55:32
okay and what is what? Which company is the affordable barn Cami? I

Unknown Speaker  55:37
think it was the same property but yeah

Unknown Speaker  55:55
okay so you said 50.1 2105 50

Speaker 3  56:02
dot 29.1

Unknown Speaker  56:13
Okay okay so

Matthias Miller  56:22
run it

Unknown Speaker  56:25
suppress account numbers

Speaker 1  56:41
okay so that's under cogs logistics

Matthias Miller  56:48
material materials

Speaker 3  56:53
now that we say it is the present

Unknown Speaker  56:59
raw materials isn't there

Unknown Speaker  57:03
any point for us Yeah, the custom cost of goods there is no raw materials when you suppress it It's okay. Yeah, custom Cost of Goods 50 dot 20 Okay.

Speaker 4  57:24
29 107 is the same thing or 105 Yeah,

Speaker 1  57:28
I'm seeing that that's Yikes, okay, that's really disturbing I will pursue that

Speaker 4  57:47
it's not some setting on the chart of accounts like on those specific accounts that's causing it is it

Unknown Speaker  57:57
No, I don't think so. I mean, the I think it's a bug in the report.

Speaker 4  58:06
I think those were the only ones that we noticed. Right? Well, that was yeah, it was

Unknown Speaker  58:15
I mean, it's not super urgent either. We can just always with the accountant

Speaker 1  58:23
Well you're very tolerant to errors and accounting rates when you say it's not super urgent Yeah, well It concerns me so I will.

Speaker 3  58:44
Well, it is concerning but when we when we actually have hoops that we can jump through then we can know how to get to the hill. Yeah, so the urgent items are the ones with no hoops

Speaker 1  58:59
to ferret out very well I will pursue that.

Speaker 4  59:04
The other thing that we might have for Joel is number seven on my list and maybe this is all you Matthias is the option to Add Asset IDs onto vendor invoices. I'll just run through my thought real quick and then you can guess that we sold it we will need the ability to add asset IDs on to vendor invoices, ideally per line item on the invoice so the thought is that we'll have a process in place which we don't want to disappoint where an invoice comes through and it's bucket backing up if we are creating a new asset we'll have this drew we'll set up the new asset let's assume we're setting up a a spray booth for painting shit. And so he sets up the the asset and then as him Voice has come through for like the spray gun or the hose or the lights or that that get attached to that asset will note that and then we'll one when the invoice is goes through AP to pay we want them to say we want them to say that when you when you select the chart of accounts like a child of fixed asset that what I've listed are fixed asset property plant and equipment that it will say oh you are an asset This is an asset account what asset Do you want to be linked to? And then it seems it would be intuitive to just display in the assets that have not yet been put in service and asset already put in service. You don't want to be adding invoices to so and it would also keep the selection list on acids pretty short. So I guess back to unify us is that do we need do we want Joe's involved in here is something that you have on your side? Not sure

Matthias Miller  1:01:15
it's it's on my side. Okay, good.

Speaker 1  1:01:23
Cool All right. And is that the last potential item for me then

Unknown Speaker  1:01:37
last thing I have no

Unknown Speaker  1:01:40
I don't have anything else. All right.

Speaker 1  1:01:44
Well, I will sign off them good talking with you all Yes, thank you.

Matthias Miller  1:01:50
Thanks Joe.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:51
All right Have a great one.

Unknown Speaker  1:02:22
Guys I guess back to you wherever you want to

Matthias Miller  1:02:27
start you will start working through the agenda and go from there

Unknown Speaker  1:02:37
the agenda I send over

Matthias Miller  1:02:39
or yeah agenda you send over and then we'll grab my stuff after that.

Speaker 4  1:02:43
So one we move that to mid April I believe payroll transactions standard employers report completed received not voucher we covered a portion Oh do you have is this report you want to

Unknown Speaker  1:03:06
look at you

Unknown Speaker  1:03:21
oh one raw materials

Matthias Miller  1:03:41
to switch because I didn't

Unknown Speaker  1:03:48
you know

Speaker 3  1:04:06
these guys did you get something figured out with them like I was from what I can tell it's items that are in received not vouchered because we didn't get a we didn't get an invoice Yeah. A vendor any doors

Matthias Miller  1:04:30
okay. So this is a

Unknown Speaker  1:04:36
me

Unknown Speaker  1:04:45
Are you needing this

Matthias Miller  1:04:48
to be here at close to verify?

Unknown Speaker  1:04:50
So this goes to

Matthias Miller  1:04:55
what is this? These are buildings

Speaker 3  1:05:05
So, but this report is the raw materials report.

Matthias Miller  1:05:13
So, what do you want to show for buildings? Or is there something else that you want to see? This material so

Unknown Speaker  1:05:23
it's only the debits you really want to look at it.

Speaker 3  1:05:28
Yeah. reported it would be if we're looking at

Speaker 4  1:05:33
okay, this isn't looking at trends. This isn't the general ledger for received that voucher it's looking for.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:43
I got it. Okay.

Matthias Miller  1:05:47
So if we if we run this report for receive Did you check received that voucher was that working as you expected? So

Speaker 3  1:06:00
basically, this this particular report right here, all of these items should be the credits that happened during this month. That's being sent sense. And then these items are actually what we were wanting to see.

Speaker 4  1:06:20
Right? Well, these are just showing recent what we've received. Right? We wanted a way to validate that received not voucher debt, whatever the balance has told 31 is going is correct. So I think if you would use his transactions by contact report and go to receive not select receive a voucher, we could see. Yeah, it was either this report or the account balance diagnostics. I'm not sure if it wasn't the account balance diagnostics.

Speaker 3  1:07:13
Yeah, I don't think this is this isn't what I was looking at. But it actually could be helpful for some things when this is you could see what came in and what might happen. But no, that's definitely not what I was looking at. Yeah. No, it wasn't this it was it was that other thing? Yeah, I know what I'm looking at now. What do

Speaker 4  1:07:38
we get if we look at the account balance diagnostics, like does that data show us which ones entered and left and then we'll write so we could cross reference the two right yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:08:06
I have a version of the report. Good news is a version of the report that better handles received not vouchered The bad news is that it was slow before it's slower now.

Speaker 4  1:08:38
So are these groups are sorted by like how can you see which ones don't cancel each other out.

Speaker 3  1:08:47
But this is the one we had concluded that's not going to work for these purposes. The thing so the new version you have just watched

Matthias Miller  1:08:58
me send you

Matthias Miller  1:09:07
send you a link to it and you can play around with it in the Chat

Unknown Speaker  1:11:09
So wanting to write

Speaker 4  1:11:14
and then for link from vendor invoice to check record, we move that out. What mid April

Matthias Miller  1:11:25
we're gonna take a look at this. I think this is one that's this is one that we can hand over to Bangladesh.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:32
You said you did we're delegating? I think and

Speaker 4  1:11:37
yeah, yeah dated for earlier than that was in April and move into March and March that sounds better than April 1.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:49
Yeah.

Speaker 4  1:11:53
F meeting the other day, the one speaker really hammered home on the point about the difference between saying You said it's much easier if you make a mistake made me think of this, it's much easier to say you were right. And to say I was wrong. He said that's human nature. There's not like I was wrong but he was making the case that that's

Matthias Miller  1:12:20
true humility. That's great

Speaker 3  1:12:36
what's the to do remove? I just started doing

Matthias Miller  1:12:45
I forget what column it is. It's a diagnostic column that not gonna stay around.

Speaker 3  1:12:52
So these have all come in and gone out properly, okay, then we got a date change. These would just be current items up in here

Matthias Miller  1:13:31
what are we looking at? Are you well, I mean, the main thing is that ones that that have been closed out for receiving vouchers should be should be showing up as bounced out.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:54
Saying at the bottom

Matthias Miller  1:13:59
like these Yeah. Like those guys, like previously, those, those would not have been, like everything here was separated out separately. That's the main the main difference.

Speaker 4  1:14:13
So are you saying the ones that have a debit and credit? Like from from our juice add from that from there on down? There's nothing to do with those. Those are? So what needs to happen are the ones up about?

Matthias Miller  1:14:27
Well, I mean, I don't know. Stick your head in them and find out. I mean, I don't know that there's a good answer without just taking a look at them individually. Some of them might just not be

Unknown Speaker  1:14:42
so let's take a look at one of them.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:45
Here's one that has two numbers. They don't match.

Matthias Miller  1:14:54
198

Unknown Speaker  1:14:55
Where does the 198 come from?

Matthias Miller  1:15:01
It's probably off a vendor in oh it's going up the vendor invoice

Unknown Speaker  1:15:09
No, it's the line item here.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:13
But if you had the energy surcharge of $6 you end up but right but

Speaker 3  1:15:22
the 204 95 is actually what the transactions are on both sides.

Matthias Miller  1:15:28
When we're translating it, we're not translating it correctly we're gonna pop up with a vendor invoice the VI and D link they're the highlighted language you're looking at that one yeah we're not no no

Matthias Miller  1:15:56
we shouldn't be a less complicated way to get this done and I'm not sure if there is a way

Matthias Miller  1:16:21
let me pull it up on my my computer and see if I can figure out what's going on

Unknown Speaker  1:16:30
to 495

Speaker 4  1:16:53
So how do we figure out if they're still legit what we're trying to do is make so that we have a budget balance for the end of the year but something could have entered received now Gosh Am I month prior still be sitting there right

Speaker 3  1:17:11
yeah like this one was not actually sitting there as it does come in and go out

Unknown Speaker  1:17:25
this not reporting

Speaker 3  1:17:29
because we're pulling we're saying this is the this line item amount is our debit but this is our credit so then the saying it's still sending an alert Mark saying it's been received the balance

Speaker 4  1:17:44
this would add add or subtract $6 to that account whatever it is

Unknown Speaker  1:18:03
coy painful

Speaker 3  1:18:10
wood this this fuel surcharge never had received not voucher this was that what is causing the issue

Unknown Speaker  1:18:33
the other what's the account

Matthias Miller  1:18:41
well it would go through received would be just wondering what the final pricing they send them my receiving invoice which ones would have been during the race that's the

Unknown Speaker  1:19:01
yeah see those are the voices

Unknown Speaker  1:19:04
yeah so we already saw those are other side

Speaker 4  1:19:15
Why did these transactions match from the other one to like or does they

Speaker 3  1:19:19
they do backup to their well shoot I didn't this is.

Matthias Miller  1:19:51
We see vacant I'm trying to pull up

Unknown Speaker  1:20:00
really slow okay, it ended with the installation sounds good?

Unknown Speaker  1:20:38
Seeing numbers, were

Speaker 4  1:20:42
the ones that balanced each other out. Oh, this is still your own account balance.

Speaker 3  1:20:50
Oh, this is the old version. That's right.

Matthias Miller  1:20:56
Why didn't it go back to lids?

Unknown Speaker  1:21:17
Well

Matthias Miller  1:21:31
all right, still loading on this end. Yeah. slowly

Speaker 4  1:21:41
as you you still digging into that? Or should we keep going with some of the other things while this loads? Or?

Matthias Miller  1:21:47
Yeah, we can we can keep keep going well this loads.

Speaker 4  1:21:50
Okay. So if we go to number five closing books ignore a bit of meeting notes, I updated notes from a quick review that Joe and I did this morning, at least on the first two pieces. So customer deposits. I'd like to review the invoices with a zero to eight $0 payment and why they're listed on this report whether we can just ignore them. And 2109969 is such an example. I don't want to take a look at it.

Speaker 4  1:22:28
And once again, just to validate and verify the report you sent, we chose all buildings that had a payment recorded all sales orders that had a sales order all sales orders that had a payment recorded as of 1231. But were not yet invoiced. Correct.

Matthias Miller  1:22:51
It's all payments, right? Yeah, all payments that were not invoiced as of 1231. And all their payments made prior to 1231 or the invoicing date.

Unknown Speaker  1:23:05
Oh, so you're saying all

Speaker 4  1:23:13
now is that And is that an and those two criteria or or not? AND, and OR but you're saying it's have to

Matthias Miller  1:23:25
be for both. So it's only showing the payments that are actually that are by the way there should be a better term for this deposit mean can mean two things but anyway, customer deposits, not bank deposits, but these are only the payments that are customer deposits.

Speaker 4  1:23:42
So there's a lot of other sales orders out there. Possibly out there but they just have no customer deposits. Recorded

Matthias Miller  1:23:50
Correct. Okay, correct. Okay, so in this case, this one here there were no and so payment date. Yeah. Oh, okay

Unknown Speaker  1:24:19
here

Speaker 4  1:24:21
Oh, you're doing like that as of the end

Matthias Miller  1:24:41
okay, so if it's either it's not been invoiced or the payment date is before the invoice date. So if you make a payment on the day of invoicing, it's a payment, not a deposit, and the payment is before the as of date. And then the issue here that you're seeing is that we should be have have the same criteria for this. We're showing payments we're showing, we just need to basically exclude those $0 items. So let's try that.

Speaker 4  1:25:25
Is that correct to just exclude those? Yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:25:29
I mean, there are no deposits if you're only looking to see deposits that are in that case.

Speaker 3  1:25:37
Oh, so those would just be ones that fall during the top of proper timeframe. There's just no payments on. Like, yeah, ordered and not invoiced and nobody made.

Matthias Miller  1:25:56
Might be, I mean, yeah, it could be any number of reasons. I mean, it could be the sales order existed. First paid the deposit was after the as of date. Well, I mean, that's really the reason you're looking

Speaker 4  1:26:12
at, if it hasn't been invoiced yet, and it has a payment or deposit. Now you're saying the deposit also.

Matthias Miller  1:26:24
Why is this not I would expect this to. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:26:27
there. We also have

Speaker 3  1:26:29
good you actually make that via selection button to show or hide those like in case? Yeah. I mean, I could see it being used for other diagnostics, but I mean, that's a big thing that is not worth chasing down now.

Matthias Miller  1:26:48
Yeah. Okay, so we're showing anything with? We have? Okay, well, let's take a look at these. See what's going on? Oh, well, fair enough. We are going to exclude for some reason, $0 payments. So

Speaker 4  1:27:10
let's take a look at that one. Just a little bit more. I mean, make sure that that's why is it $0 cash. Why would somebody do that?

Matthias Miller  1:27:18
Canceled per Mark due to duplicate? I mean, I don't know.

Unknown Speaker  1:27:23
Nine? We should be excluding

Matthias Miller  1:27:25
canceled sales orders. Let's try that.

Speaker 3  1:27:29
Well, not necessarily because it had been live over that time. And is now here.

Matthias Miller  1:27:37
Well, let's see what else we have $0 canceled per Mark due to duplicate? I'm gonna guess these are these are all on the same day. So I'm gonna say cancel per minute. Duplicate, okay.

Speaker 3  1:27:51
Do they have to cancel? Or something like

Matthias Miller  1:27:55
that? I have no idea upgrade customer. I mean, I

Unknown Speaker  1:28:01
think on those they have to do is you

Speaker 3  1:28:06
know, this is that one that we have gone round and round. This is the 40 to 55. While we're here, you should be able to see that I switched it from financing to check payment method

Unknown Speaker  1:28:23
up towards the top. Yeah.

Speaker 3  1:28:29
Yep, I don't know if that's what I was doing. But it was not showing up as a payment to be received. Or to be deposited.

Speaker 4  1:28:40
So, am I correct that when you do a write off, certain write off, you know, you have to enter a $0 payment and then do

Matthias Miller  1:28:51
but it doesn't have a write off? It's another write off? I mean, am I kidding? This is? No this is this was done when you created it. So if you create this is a $0 down. This is you guys do $0 Like it's it's financing. However, that is it's a $0 down. And so the system creates a it looks to me at least now this is a modify. Okay, so we created it. Then we added itemization 50 or four, et cetera, et cetera. And then we added a an upgrade customer

Speaker 4  1:29:38
payment payment amount of zero. So does does. Does that happen when?

Matthias Miller  1:29:46
Yeah, and we took it from a quote from a quote to a sale. So I think anytime you do a $0 down for whatever reason financing or I don't know if truepoint is still doing this or not but what We still, it looks to me like we still had a $0 payment row.

Speaker 4  1:30:08
So, okay, so we can say if there's a $0 payment

Speaker 4  1:30:18
don't Well, I think they're there. Okay, there we just take No, I mean, it doesn't hurt the math, I would probably prefer to keep them. I would prefer to keep them there now that I know the logic behind them just I think we'll get into more trouble trying to exclude them properly, then we will just leaving them

Matthias Miller  1:30:39
there. Okay, but we can't exclude the does seem proper to exclude rows that don't have any mean changing the we are sometimes incorrectly including items that appears to me. If what was the logic? We

Unknown Speaker  1:31:03
you weren't respecting the payment date? Right?

Matthias Miller  1:31:06
So it was the No, this one doesn't this one didn't matter. My change didn't do anything. I'm actually voting to go ticket back the way it was. Because I don't think that actually that had no functional change, because we're excluding that elsewhere.

Speaker 4  1:31:33
So we're, we're concluding that it's good, exactly as as it was, right.

Matthias Miller  1:31:37
Here we are. Okay, good.

Speaker 4  1:31:40
So if we move on to the next point, you can provide through the link to this customer deposits report meeting.

Matthias Miller  1:31:50
Good. Is this good enough that we can push it the standard? Or do you guys want to play around with it more?

Speaker 4  1:32:00
I'd say the latter was kind of it's kind of a one off thing that I say let's keep it a user report right now. So okay, that takes us to the second point. And then what we're gonna do is review customer deposits report with districts update sales orders as needed. Am I correct that this will in turn update this report? So we go through and we we have some old old sales orders that have deposits 21 or 22? And then we correct that. We say we say all? Whatever this this should be?

Speaker 4  1:33:00
Yeah, like, take a look at that one, like the $2,000 payment on 1112 121.

Matthias Miller  1:33:13
The customer wish to cancel I sure hope we I mean, non refundable deposit match? I don't know.

Speaker 4  1:33:19
Who knows, probably wasn't so. So like this one, there probably was a refund done. We update the sales order and reflect that, that in turn will update our report. Right. But this, this usually gets created?

Matthias Miller  1:33:39
Well, I mean, how do you want it reflected in there? Are you going to show a? Wouldn't it be nice? Do you want a? Well? Yeah, I'm sure.

Speaker 4  1:33:55
I would think we would just do it a negative, like, like the one up above the 550. While we record a payment than a negative? If we do that, that will reflect Greg on this report. Right? Yes. So I thought it was we go through, we do that. And then once we have that customer deposits report, where we believe it's accurate, we proceed to the next step where we push an accounting update, and then like a nightly update, or we push it, you know, just a manual push. Then at that point, we'll validate that customer deposits report total matches in accounting with this feat. And if there's differences there, then

Unknown Speaker  1:34:41
we'll explore those,

Unknown Speaker  1:34:42
but do you see a better? Are there holes to that link?

Matthias Miller  1:34:50
I mean, it seems like either way, you're going to have to do what you're proposing. Okay. I think I mean, well, I say that Technically yeah there are holes so old buildings that you still hold a deposit if you have any buildings that you hold the deposit on prior to June of last year you're going to have to create a manual entry for

Speaker 3  1:35:25
me like like that particular building will have to figure out if if that sale was actually canceled or not.

Matthias Miller  1:35:36
Well I mean it says it was cancelled here did we did we issue the refund so

Speaker 3  1:35:42
we'll have to take care of the the refund issue side but then for accounts receivable we also need to do any like with this thing show up as receivable still or not if it's canceled if it's canceled, so it's no longer so I'm gonna have to deal with that. So we just have to basically show that we are issuing him a refund

Unknown Speaker  1:36:08
or if it was non refundable, we do something

Speaker 4  1:36:17
anything else on possibly deposits so accounts receivable notes here is I think there was you are going to add invoice date to these reports and then we'd like to group by invoice date ranging report as it is currently is now the non STI

Speaker 4  1:36:52
So, what we need to show here is is the invoice date and then group by the invoice date aging because that's technically what

Matthias Miller  1:37:09
I mean do you want aging as of the as of date or aging as of today

Unknown Speaker  1:37:16
aging adds up the Aza

Matthias Miller  1:37:20
that should be what it's showing now

Speaker 4  1:37:23
we don't have invoice date so I think we're using build date which gives them they're

Matthias Miller  1:37:37
not gonna guess that shouldn't be there

Unknown Speaker  1:37:46
okay good.

Speaker 4  1:37:51
Well, let's take a look at mean I think it is okay, because the further down you come the older your invoice but okay, no. What do you have? Oh,

Speaker 3  1:38:03
those are miscellaneous or something because there's no stems on those first ones

Speaker 4  1:38:08
but then we have Ohio we have North Carolina okay, this is looking at is this looking at all districts combined

Speaker 3  1:38:18
isn't it's me, it's ABC. Well, isn't ABC I don't know what I figured out on the other one is the thought it was like ABC buildings but they might be in district of another state. like kind of like that receive payments where we were having you know, it's an ABC building but it's in the Indiana district

Speaker 4  1:38:55
Okay, so I'm seeing the invoice that I have marked here which I think should not be listed here like and 2312236. Like why is that listed as AR as a ball 31 since

Unknown Speaker  1:39:18
since the invoice date was after first of the year

Matthias Miller  1:39:23
where the invoice date were stickler.

Matthias Miller  1:39:38
If the payment

Matthias Miller  1:39:47
we are recording deposits as negative amounts on the AR which is why it's showing up here

Matthias Miller  1:40:03
But really, we should be doing.

Speaker 3  1:40:07
I mean, for real AR That is correct. Thank

Speaker 4  1:40:14
Okay, so what you're saying is all negative the only time we'll have an invoice date beyond 1231 Beyond the as of date if there's a

Unknown Speaker  1:40:22
was a deposit,

Speaker 4  1:40:25
but that doesn't get er, like, that's lowering our AR and it shouldn't have any impact on AR at

Speaker 3  1:40:32
all. Yeah, because because they are is not as high for that particular customer as it as what the invoice on his name says. Like, I mean, unless you just took the total, you know, unless you found the difference and apply that day are like the difference between invoice, invoice total minus deposit or sales order total minus deposit, and then then apply that to your AR, but this applies sales order total to two AR as positive and deposit to AR as negative.

Speaker 4  1:41:14
But if we're looking at it, he says, Oh, it should be like this. We're looking at this is lowering AR by

Matthias Miller  1:41:24
we should just exclude these buildings. It's an AR report. You wouldn't have seen them if you would have done it on the 30 person who would have seen them

Speaker 3  1:41:34
through through okay, she knows there they were not AR as of that day because they were not in

Matthias Miller  1:41:46
make sure in which date is greater than we're saying or the invoice date is invoice invoice before scenario. Okay, let's try this you can fuse in now the negatives are left

Unknown Speaker  1:42:13
and you have nothing greater than

Matthias Miller  1:42:17
Yeah, you have no invoice states that are greater than

Speaker 4  1:42:20
now what if you had an old payment? Like take a look at the fence right what happens you have some overpayments and you will have to lower payments on chance right? I don't want that side. So those those should show up

Matthias Miller  1:42:36
right there these guys

Speaker 4  1:42:40
at 2000 There's some work to do. I think this is I think this is correct so long as you have access

Unknown Speaker  1:42:55
Yeah, and I had a link you sent a link to a

Speaker 4  1:42:59
good drop get ready for the meeting to if you want to move on.

Speaker 3  1:43:03
Sorry that so we were gonna come back

Unknown Speaker  1:43:07
the accounts payable I think. Yeah, you had another report.

Unknown Speaker  1:43:13
So well, whatever you want to do with us.

Matthias Miller  1:43:17
I'm getting I mean, I'm good to keep going at least for another 15 minutes or so.

Speaker 3  1:43:23
I mean, the accounts payable is mostly Is there anything more that we need to do as far as those vendor mismatches? I mean, I saw them come through like we had something like 1300 new line items and reconcile that showed up and that's because of getting those things those vendors straight now and the ones that I sent you new vendor names for is that all taken care of. I mean they came through so I'll leave so

Matthias Miller  1:43:57
yeah, I mean I I transferred all those over.

Speaker 3  1:44:00
Okay, so now it would just be a me it just be a matter of me going back to that Accounts Payable diagnostics and looking and seeing if we have other kinds of problems

Matthias Miller  1:44:16
asked by you yeah

Unknown Speaker  1:44:25
okay.

Matthias Miller  1:44:49
The RMB need to look at raw materials, we'll take a look at undeposited funds I was looking at customer deposits. I had that written down wrong in my notes. That's why

Matthias Miller  1:45:11
updating the finished goods inventory percentages, don't take a look at that quick for you. So there's two places under here, let me just shoot this over to an email. Under districts. There is an inventory material percentage. And then there's also a lender

Unknown Speaker  1:45:51
build

Matthias Miller  1:46:06
then under builders, you would have production labor production overhead

Matthias Miller  1:46:26
Yeah, production, labor production overhead inventory percentage, I think is an old calculation. And then this is also where you would set the freeze labor and labor intensive building rules.

Speaker 3  1:46:40
Okay, the district's inventory, which tab? Was that under was that in the admin, or was

Matthias Miller  1:46:46
that production? Center? The production tab?

Speaker 3  1:46:49
Okay, that's under production. The builder one is under admin.

Matthias Miller  1:46:53
Correct? And for each of these, you're going to want to create a new row.

Speaker 3  1:47:08
Oh, leave? What's there? Just create a new row. Got it?

Speaker 3  1:47:21
Otherwise, is this a thing like the FTI cost allocations where it will update from that date forward?

Matthias Miller  1:47:37
No, it will.

Speaker 3  1:47:41
Or is this if I just put this in it will just update everything?

Matthias Miller  1:47:45
No, it'll it'll it'll go on new buildings going in will only be for if you backdate it, then standard percentages will remain the same. Historically. Okay. So if you want otherwise I don't know my brain is tired. I mean, what we really need is, can we talk about a way to listen historically apply this as?

Speaker 3  1:48:23
Yeah, that might because I'm, I'm understanding. We're wanting to be able to do this in order to make so that so that we're matching the inventory or the amounts that are being used currently. Like, so we're going to have to update some stuff back historically, I think.

Matthias Miller  1:48:50
Sure. Let's, let's circle back to it when we come back. I am hitting a little bit of a capacity limit.

Unknown Speaker  1:49:02
Yeah, yes.

Matthias Miller  1:49:05
Good. Then, do we we I guess we didn't know was down sometimes we've done one o'clock. Sometimes we've done 130 What's good for you guys.

Unknown Speaker  1:49:19
Um, probably 130 would be best.

Matthias Miller  1:49:22
Okay, planning that. Awesome. Thank you. You bet. Thanks.
