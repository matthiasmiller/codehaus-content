Unknown Speaker  03:17
Hey, we finally made it Hey.

Unknown Speaker  03:22
The the little technical difficulties.

Matthias Miller  03:26
Understand those things happen.

Unknown Speaker  03:32
You switched offices on us.

Matthias Miller  03:34
I did switch offices on you guys. I I'm meeting a friend this afternoon to work on a on a AI project, and we're meeting in a in a coffee shop. So

Unknown Speaker  03:46
gotcha all yours. All right.

Matthias Miller  03:57
So got the screenshots we were talking about doing here. I'm gonna, I don't have my big screen. So that's the, that's the downside about being here, yeah. So so we were looking at at hours worked from heavy job to foundation.

Speaker 1  04:29
Okay, so that leads me to something that I don't think we've talked about, that was just kind of started popping in my head. So currently heavy job to foundation and heavy bit e3 60 to foundation is one person does an export, another person does an import. So it's a two person project. That is done one time per week. Okay? The only reason it's done one time per week instead of daily is because it's a two person project to do it

Unknown Speaker  05:16
well and payroll. I don't know if you can do it, though, maybe

Speaker 1  05:23
so I guess where I'm going with it. I'm not sure all the ins and outs of this, but if we could automate that routine to where on a I can't imagine doing it any more than daily.

Unknown Speaker  05:40
But you don't want to do it. It would

Speaker 1  05:43
automatically come into foundation without people happen to integrate with it, right? Rylan says we don't want to do it daily, just

Speaker 2  05:54
because if somebody doesn't have their Concord complete, then that's kind of

Unknown Speaker  05:59
well in the approval process.

Speaker 1  06:03
Yeah, thank you. We may have to change, we would have to change that approval process. We've done it more often than weekly, but at a minimum, if we can do it automatic, if we can automate the routine one time per week, that would be kind of sweet. But I was thinking doing it more often, so that foundation had up to date information, instead of running a week behind

Speaker 3  06:31
well, but that still isn't going to post until we do payroll. Okay? I don't think that's going to speed

Speaker 1  06:37
anything up. Does not okay? It may not be a that may not be a trail that's worth traveling down, but it's worth noting. I mean,

Unknown Speaker  06:46
if it's

Unknown Speaker  06:48
it, yeah, just like that.

Matthias Miller  06:52
And I think it's, it's worth it. These are the types of things where it's worth asking the question, how much you know, how much work is it to automate? And if it's drop dead simple, do it? But it sounds like the kind of task that isn't incredibly time consuming, but it could be, I could be mistaken. Yeah. And does do those exports include the earning codes and all of that, all of that information,

Unknown Speaker  07:25
yes.

Speaker 3  07:28
All right, I'm trying to think if there's anything that's just defaulted from the employee file. I mean, other words, doesn't come from or from heavy job, but it pulls the default on foundation.

Speaker 1  07:47
Can't think what that would be, but I do know that it would and heavy job if we set it to a different earning code or paid class, is what heavy job calls it, then it comes to you with that other pay class,

Speaker 4  08:01
right? So it would heavy job is the one that's setting the earning code or or pay plus, yeah, yeah. So

Unknown Speaker  08:10
I think I would say it all comes from every job, yeah.

Matthias Miller  08:15
And, I mean, I think this is probably where, if to really get the details, understanding the export import process. Is it, is it a direct export import? Is it a, you know, is there any mapping from, you know, as it goes across, etc, that's one of the questions I would have.

Speaker 1  08:36
I think originally it was mapped. You'd have to map it somewhere another, because it just exports to an Excel, then that to a

Unknown Speaker  08:50
CSV.

Speaker 3  08:51
I think it's CSV. Might be a text file. One of them was x score on CSV, but yeah, yeah, just exports file and then, and then foundation imports those, those two files, okay, all

Matthias Miller  09:08
right. I mean, if it's a direct export, import, that's simple. So we got that equipment we need to get into.

Matthias Miller  09:26
We have been wanting some of the

Unknown Speaker  09:36
that's jobs,

Matthias Miller  09:37
that's jobs grabbing the wrong one.

Speaker 4  09:43
Let me grab the he's slumming today with these little screen.

Matthias Miller  09:56
There we go, these guys. Okay, so this one is. That's heavy. That's something else heavy. Bit heavy bid. I'm gonna pop this out too.

Speaker 1  10:13
I think I know where we're going on this, and so I do have some more information. One thing that we got into last time was the fact that we have old equipment that has a old equipment ID and foundation e3, 60 and heavy job uses the new equipment ID, equipment number, whatever you want to call it. I got a hold of support with foundation, and they told me they couldn't do anything about it. So I went on up another level of Foundation, and the consultants at Foundation, and they say they can run us. They can create a script for us that will change the equipment number to the new one. So I'm suspicious that's going to be an expensive little proposition, but I think it'll solve a lot of our problems, because currently, I'll use ex two, for example, it's ex, this may not be exactly right, but ex two and e3 60 and Heavy job match. But in foundation, it's E, 80x 200 200 LC, right? So I think it'll fix a lot of our problems there. Awesome,

Matthias Miller  11:54
and that would be equipment number and accounting code. Is that right?

Unknown Speaker  11:59
When leaking? Yes.

Speaker 1  12:05
So it should just be equipment the accounting code. It should eliminate the accounting code. Eliminate the

Matthias Miller  12:11
accounting code, equipment number to equipment ID, yeah,

Speaker 1  12:20
they call it, writing a script. Is that, S C R, I P, S C R, I P,

Matthias Miller  12:25
T script like that, with the T, yeah, and it's probably, it's probably a SQL script, database script to update database values. Okay, in some capacity, I

Speaker 5  12:40
Yeah, so we could

Matthias Miller  12:55
next that, did you? Did you? Did you find out anything more about the foundation code in e3, 60? I mean, do we? We don't. We can completely ignore it, but

Speaker 1  13:08
we should be able to do the same thing with the with the 360 is what? Yeah, I think that takes care of the TBD, right? There

Speaker 4  13:22
would fix the employee not matching as well, right? Are we having trouble with the employee code not matching for

Speaker 1  13:33
oh, we have different MDP. The same thing, right? Rylan just brought up that we've got old employees that have

Speaker 3  13:43
old because my numbers are, foundation is b, r, U, C, E, and so

Speaker 1  13:49
in theory, foundation should be able to fix that too, if they can fix that Sure thing. So

Unknown Speaker  13:53
someone need to remember foundation.

Unknown Speaker  13:57
Do we have a note in there on employees?

Matthias Miller  14:01
We do. We have them linked by employee number to employee code, employee number two, e3

Speaker 2  14:11
that next bullet point that you have under the right that, yeah, we should be able

Speaker 1  14:20
to fix the foundation. I did not specifically ask them that, but I'm I'm going to hope and assume and it's doing the same thing. It's doing the same thing as the equipment.

Unknown Speaker  14:37
That would be a sweet thing.

Unknown Speaker  14:42
We might sure the only

Matthias Miller  14:45
I'm sure the consultants can do it. I'm sure it's just another line item on the invoice, right, right. All right. So does Foundation. Equipment does Foundation have? It's got a description. I'm not seeing any of this information.

Speaker 1  15:12
It would be on the on this purchase data and additional

Matthias Miller  15:15
and oh, there we go. I gotta scroll down. All right, yeah, let's see.

Speaker 1  15:21
Manufacturer would be the make. The model would be the mate. I don't know why it says make slash model, but

Matthias Miller  15:40
and then the serial number would map across either to the to the VIN, if it's a valid Vin, else to the serial number. Or,

Speaker 1  15:52
yeah, I I think e3 60 offers a bin and a serial number option, either one. I don't know

Unknown Speaker  16:02
why.

Unknown Speaker  16:10
Well,

Speaker 4  16:13
yeah, then wouldn't have it serial, so it should be neat or Okay, most things

Unknown Speaker  16:21
I would, I

Unknown Speaker  16:23
would agree with that. I just can't prove why. I

Matthias Miller  16:27
mean, would you, would you want to conditionally drop it into the vid? I mean, we can. We can have any, any kind of logic, and we don't have to get, I don't know that we have to nail it down now, but we do any 10 digit serial into the van. We could check the check digit for a valid bin. We could or just always throw it into the cereal in the 360 Well, we're always throwing the VIN. Is

Speaker 2  16:53
there another column over there? I thought I'd so go up to the sheet above that. No, that's just plate and license expiration, course,

Matthias Miller  17:07
purchase, data, cost, areas, warranty

Unknown Speaker  17:13
and doesn't have anything nice of them,

Speaker 1  17:22
I would assume a serial number is a serial number. And we can make, we can make that assumption. And I

Unknown Speaker  17:31
Yeah, all right.

Matthias Miller  17:35
We have the purchase date to purchase date. We have the purchase price. We have we have the sale price to resale value. I'm assuming, is that correct

Speaker 3  17:53
or no? Well, salvage value,

Matthias Miller  17:58
that's a good point.

Speaker 3  18:01
That would be on the UDF tab very last one. There we go.

Matthias Miller  18:13
And then the purchase run. Would that be the I don't know, vendor, distributor.

Speaker 1  18:22
Next one up or no, that's correct distributor, but we didn't

Speaker 4  18:26
buy that. Yeah, we did. Oh yes, we did. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  18:39
Okay, so then this status would be, maybe the status would just be in, oh, the status we have. Do you guys know what the other status is on this one

Unknown Speaker  18:54
second? Rachel,

Speaker 3  18:58
available, sold, missing scrap or on site,

Matthias Miller  19:12
I mean, something like this.

Speaker 3  19:23
The on site has a in parentheses attached. I wonder. I don't know what that really even means.

Unknown Speaker  19:34
That's supposed to be like attachments or something like

Speaker 1  19:38
that. So hold on, say so what we're looking at here is in foundation, if it says available, we want to map it to what in e3, 60 is that. Is that what we're looking at

Matthias Miller  19:50
Yes, and more specifically, yes, that is, I mean more getting even more specific, what in how do we. Set the status in e3 60,

Speaker 1  20:02
okay, because e3 60, I think it's got like five statuses. Rylan, can you open e3, 6360, you can open it, though, and I can log into it, right? Like I

Speaker 2  20:13
can even open there's never, I've never been on 360

Unknown Speaker  20:18
Okay, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  20:22
How do I duplicate screens? Function?

Unknown Speaker  20:29
P, okay,

Speaker 4  20:34
there's B, I'm going to extend it. I'm going to put

Unknown Speaker  20:41
this.

Unknown Speaker  20:43
Figure out where they're but

Speaker 5  20:46
okay, let me leave that there.

Speaker 4  20:56
Okay, and then I'm going to go open. Uh,

Unknown Speaker  21:03
uh, office, 365

Unknown Speaker  21:06
360 e3, 60. Open that on here. Just download it on there so you got

Speaker 6  21:19
it. Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo

Speaker 4  21:22
I've got to do is be on the right, secure. Still did I find this out the last time this is starting to seem kind of familiar. I'm on guess, too. Um,

Speaker 5  22:18
are you back? Yeah, he's back. Here we go. Okay, I hit the wrong button and

Speaker 4  22:30
the control K, get you back up on the big screen, because if I switch there, then I say, what? That's just Chad, uh. Chad 6807 Well, oh, I don't know about this. It's just anything. It just yeah, my username and password.

Unknown Speaker  23:10
You've got 8360, don't you? Well

Unknown Speaker  23:33
good you want.

Speaker 3  23:38
But, yeah, I know, precious.

Unknown Speaker  23:42
Little equipment Id

Unknown Speaker  23:45
just enter ex tube.

Unknown Speaker  23:55
Enter,

Unknown Speaker  23:57
Okay, over here in status,

Unknown Speaker  24:01
okay, we've got five of them

Speaker 1  24:07
in e3 60 available, down, imported, in service, out of service. And I just talked to e3 60, I think, yesterday, and I think we can delete all those, and we can customize all those however we want to. So in theory, we could make them match foundation.

Unknown Speaker  24:37
That's what they told me. Look at that. That would be a sweet thing.

Speaker 1  24:47
I'm not sure whether we can't see your your notes now, I don't know where that was. Oh, rylan's Got him. Yeah, that's alright. You're. Get, we get to watch you instead. I'm sorry.

Matthias Miller  25:13
All right, I like it.

Matthias Miller  25:21
So that oh, the type yet, yeah, primary category, number,

Unknown Speaker  25:29
categorized like, oh my,

Speaker 1  25:41
Hey, are we looking at foundation or e3 60?

Matthias Miller  25:46
So we're looking at the primary what we have. We're looking at what I'm assuming would be the primary category, number and foundation mapping to the type in 360

Speaker 1  25:57
Okay, so heavy job we definitely do. Let me drive here a second.

Speaker 4  26:02
Bruce, where's here it is

Unknown Speaker  26:07
in 360 Yes, it maps to the type and e3 60 and and heavy job. Go ahead and log into heavy job. Bruce,

Unknown Speaker  26:18
heavy job should be the same as 360

Speaker 1  26:21
should be, hey, I think it calls it in, in heavy job. It calls it group, if I remember, right? Yeah. So, I guess we're just looking at e3 60, right now, anyway,

Matthias Miller  26:35
well, I'll go update that, because that's we're getting ready to look at foundation. All right. So, foundation to 360 that gets us through that one, foundation to heavy job. We've got description to description.

Unknown Speaker  26:56
Let me verify that looking at the

Speaker 4  27:00
setup equipment library,

Speaker 1  27:05
and yes, description is description,

Matthias Miller  27:16
our primary category, number To group, and then we've got the active and rented check boxes in heavy job,

Unknown Speaker  27:26
yes, and so in Foundation,

Unknown Speaker  27:31
okay. Oh, there it is.

Unknown Speaker  27:36
Foundation. Yeah, purchase data,

Speaker 1  27:45
ownership, okay, on the purchase data tab and foundation, there is an ownership that can be set as owned, rented or leased.

Unknown Speaker  27:57
So owned would be obviously

Unknown Speaker  28:02
added. Obviously active.

Speaker 2  28:04
Well, no, this is, this was ownership. There I get it. He's talking about the checkbox of 360 that's read or owned. So that just needs to categorize to what in foundation.

Unknown Speaker  28:18
That's where I'm at.

Speaker 4  28:20
So, right, we've got, what are you talking about, active and inactive. Come look at it.

Speaker 1  28:28
So Foundation, I've got three options, own, Reddit or leased, owned would go to, I'm not sure what the options are. In e3, 60, but in heavy job, it would go to active and rented. I think there's a option in heavy job, or is there an option for rented? Yes, yeah, okay, so it would go to rented, and e3 60.

Unknown Speaker  29:05
I'm trying to see whether there's a

Unknown Speaker  29:09
Reddit or,

Speaker 1  29:14
Oh yeah, e3, 60 has an option for rental, leased. Least,

Matthias Miller  29:26
and that's a drop list.

Speaker 4  29:29
It's just a check mark, check okay, so,

Unknown Speaker  29:36
yeah, it's just a check box

Matthias Miller  29:42
of I rented, leased,

Speaker 5  29:52
pretty sure that we don't have a leased box and. Heavy job.

Unknown Speaker  30:06
No, it's only active or rented.

Matthias Miller  30:08
So would you want the rented to be checked if it's leased, or would you leave it unchecked?

Speaker 1  30:17
Oh, yeah, if it's if it's least, I would say, check Reddit, but

Unknown Speaker  30:22
I would say, so too.

Unknown Speaker  30:25
Death suits me. Okay,

Matthias Miller  30:32
so that takes care of the these

Unknown Speaker  30:35
guys.

Unknown Speaker  30:43
These

Matthias Miller  30:48
day daily rates from foundation to heavy job.

Speaker 1  30:55
Okay, so heavy job does not have daily rates. It has a base rate, a second rate, and a third grade. So in theory, I'm just, I'm thinking my way through this

Speaker 4  31:14
where, let's see I've got additional and where's my custom Oh, I gotta go to customized. Let me. Let me check my custom settings. Don't move those around. Please, please.

Unknown Speaker  31:33
He's getting all scared. I'm playing on his computer.

Speaker 3  31:35
When I export the budget, I use that screen, okay. Mislead

Unknown Speaker  31:39
county fuel type,

Matthias Miller  31:42
so we have these map this way,

Speaker 2  31:46
Job Costing rate, hourly to base rate, standard building rate to TM, regular rate.

Speaker 1  31:53
And so we've got, here's the options. We've gotten heavy job. We've got base rate, second rate, third grade, we've got TNM regular rate, TNM second rate, TNM third grade. We don't use anything in heavy job except for a base rate and a TNM rate. So in reality, we could use a third rate. We could use a base rate for a regular hourly cost rate. We could use a second rate for for our daily rate, and we could use a third rate for a monthly rate. What about your DM? And then we can use the TNM regular rate, and that will cover everything the foundation's got. And I, we've never, we've never even used any more than an hourly,

Unknown Speaker  32:49
no, there wasn't monthly foundation.

Speaker 1  32:51
Yeah, Foundation offers a, let's see general, additional, yeah, daily, weekly, monthly. Oh, so foundations offer daily, weekly, monthly, idle time, downtime. So 1234,

Unknown Speaker  33:08
and if I go to heavy job, it's offering 123, so, so So we'd have our base rate, we'd have a daily rate, we'd have a weekly rate.

Speaker 4  33:25
What about your TM? Does it have a TNM?

Speaker 1  33:30
Yeah, it's good. T and M, regular, T and M, second, T and M, third and I think you can, I think I can add a new

Speaker 4  33:43
that's just adding a new piece of equipment.

Speaker 1  33:50
I was I was thinking there was a place in here that I could, I could add a custom but

Unknown Speaker  33:59
this latest accounting notes for Brennan?

Speaker 1  34:01
I I don't see it. So we'd have to decide, is it worth I don't see any reason we would need any more than just daily and weekly. And currently we're not even using daily and weekly. Yes, hourly is a given, but daily. Would be very nice to be able to have a daily

Unknown Speaker  34:27
I've never seen anything other than

Speaker 1  34:28
narrowing daily just because we don't do it. We didn't know we had the option. So for now, the day, the hourly rate would go to base rate and heavy job, the daily rate would go to second rate and heavy job, the weekly rate would go to third grade and heavy job. The standard rate would be the TNM regular rate and heavy job. Yeah, and the monthly rate.

Speaker 5  35:06
Just ignore it, or I don't have anything that fits.

Speaker 1  35:14
I mean, I can use TNM second rate, but that don't make any sense.

Matthias Miller  35:19
It gets confusing real fast,

Unknown Speaker  35:24
okay, all right,

Speaker 1  35:27
and we don't need hourly rates or anything in e3, 60,

Speaker 4  35:33
correct? I don't even know that there's a place for it. Could budget hours per year on loan to replacement cycle. Nope, I don't see anything. Okay,

Matthias Miller  35:57
all right, um, good. So that takes us into Foundation. We were talking about Project class, actually we were waiting on heavy job class.

Matthias Miller  36:22
Well, first of all, heavy job. There's a whole bunch of heavy job job setup that we're missing, I believe, unless we was that

Speaker 2  36:33
in one of these, I sent you a picture, but it was the heavy bid job set up, and then that gets exported to heavy job,

Unknown Speaker  36:47
and then from heavy job, it gives the foundation, but we can't exactly set it up to where it's

Speaker 2  36:58
automating anything more than what I sent you with that heavy bid picture, which wasn't much,

Matthias Miller  37:13
can you explain?

Unknown Speaker  37:16
I pull that picture up that I sent you. I

Unknown Speaker  37:23
Is this the right one?

Speaker 2  37:26
Sorry, you're not sharing your screen. Let's see heavy dead jobs. That's what I called it. That long arrow one. Yep, it

Matthias Miller  37:39
looks like I'm sharing on my end, I'm and if it got buried again, or if there's something wrong in my end,

Speaker 1  37:50
it went away when I screwed up. Oh, you know what? There's two zoom windows open down there, around down at the bottom. I That ain't

Speaker 2  38:07
anyway, I'm looking at it right here, sure. So,

Speaker 2  38:21
the project name is that? Well, you've got the Code First off, there it is. And for some reason, there

Unknown Speaker  38:31
we got your back,

Speaker 2  38:32
that estimate code, maybe bid will not recognize a point. So that 2025, 106, you can't put in that.so the one below the project number is one that we manually input just based off of what the estimate number is, and then the estimate name. We can name them different, however, but those are both just

Matthias Miller  39:01
user input, so does the estimate number then map across to well?

Speaker 4  39:10
So what is it? Yeah, let me open up.

Speaker 1  39:16
Open up one heavy job. Yeah, heavy job. The job code is 2020, 5033. For example, there's no dot. There's

Speaker 2  39:26
no.so it is coming over, and it's coming over from estimate, not

Unknown Speaker  39:31
project number,

Unknown Speaker  39:34
which, honestly, we need to change that

Speaker 2  39:37
because, but that's within HCSS stuff, right? So unless we can force HCSS to say, hey, pull from here instead of here,

Speaker 1  39:48
what I mean was we just started putting the.in because that seemed like good idea, Bruce, are you using? You're not using the.so really going. Forward, we just need to drop the thought. We need to drop the dot. But for now, if we use the estimate just like that, it'll work fine.

Matthias Miller  40:11
But you guys are using HCSS to push, to push, I mean, to do this to push from heavy bid to heavy job. Right, right? Correct.

Speaker 2  40:26
And that's just a manual import, export, yep, oh, yeah, I guess it says that right above it,

Matthias Miller  40:36
yeah. Here we're talking about cost codes, but I don't know if that's something same or different, but

Speaker 2  40:44
it's, it's the same, same thing you just got to go through and do your entire astronaut. All right.

Speaker 1  41:02
Heavy. Job or both, HCSS products sure

Matthias Miller  41:08
make sense. So what would be the heavy job description, or what's that?

Unknown Speaker  41:15
That would be

Unknown Speaker  41:17
job code? No, it

Unknown Speaker  41:23
would be the the job code matches to the job number.

Unknown Speaker  41:27
Oh, gotcha.

Speaker 2  41:29
You're talking about the description that would be the top line there have the lslr one. Well, they're both the same, but the top line

Matthias Miller  41:41
project project name,

Speaker 2  41:44
yeah, it doesn't really have a that field doesn't have a name, I guess. But it's bizarre. Is that popcorn? Sure,

Speaker 4  41:55
heavy job. He's in heavy job, not heavy bid. That's a heavy bid screenshot. Look at these notes.

Speaker 2  42:05
It's all coming from bid period, heavy,

Unknown Speaker  42:10
not, not project name.

Matthias Miller  42:13
It just cause, that's what I it would be useful. I don't know. Are one of you guys able to share heavy job. I think it make our lives easier. It's if we're going to be pulling out of heavy job, it'd be best to use those

Speaker 1  42:29
you know, momentum. Let's see if we can bueno connect Bruce in here.

Unknown Speaker  42:36
Just make sure he's not using a mic,

Speaker 4  42:40
right? Where's your calendar and

Matthias Miller  42:46
Rylan, you don't like screeching noises. I

Unknown Speaker  43:05
join. Hi,

Speaker 4  43:09
your AI, personal companion, no audio and no video, and join.

Unknown Speaker  43:21
And

Unknown Speaker  43:23
you're about to join the meeting.

Unknown Speaker  43:31
Okay, hold on a second.

Unknown Speaker  43:35
How do I share

Unknown Speaker  43:37
the sound?

Matthias Miller  43:42
Well, they can't just turn down the volume,

Unknown Speaker  43:45
as they'll say, just turn down the volume.

Unknown Speaker  43:58
Okay, how's that?

Speaker 1  44:02
Okay? So now I need to share screen,

Speaker 4  44:07
and I'm going to share to do. Where did that go? Be, follow explorer. E3 60. I'm see

Unknown Speaker  44:24
every job. There we go.

Speaker 1  44:31
Double click to enter, okay. Now can you see it?

Matthias Miller  44:35
Yep, now I can see it.

Unknown Speaker  44:42
And you tell me where you want to go and I can change

Matthias Miller  44:46
are you able to drill into one of these jobs and get more detail? Yeah.

Speaker 4  45:03
Uh, that wasn't a job, but I just killed it. Man, Yeah, hold on a second. It's open. It says, Do you seriously want me to try and do all that at the same time?

Matthias Miller  45:20
Okay, give me a break.

Unknown Speaker  45:23
Oh, saying, I'm trying to get this thing out of my

Speaker 1  45:31
Oh, there it is, okay, so we can go to file, or maybe it's in setup job information. That where you want to see?

Matthias Miller  45:44
Yeah, I think so. All right, so is there an original contract, an original estimated cost

Unknown Speaker  45:53
on here?

Speaker 1  46:01
I don't think that's in anything here. That would be,

Unknown Speaker  46:13
yeah, have you bid estimate?

Speaker 2  46:15
Could you simply get there, pick a job that actually has something

Unknown Speaker  46:21
well like, which one

Speaker 4  46:25
restrooms at 10 should attend? Something? Is it in here?

Unknown Speaker  46:29
Yeah, okay, 41494149

Speaker 5  46:42
is okay, yeah. Same

Unknown Speaker  46:57
post, some stuff in the background here, don't I have Come on. Don't be dying on me.

Speaker 4  47:21
Yeah, it's, it's not liking it very well. Okay, so now I'm with 2024, 149,

Unknown Speaker  47:32
I go up to

Unknown Speaker  47:33
setup and job information.

Unknown Speaker  47:37
Okay, like that route

Speaker 4  47:38
is okay, so that's where that's mapping from heavy bid, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  47:47
okay, but if we're Looking for budget,

Speaker 4  47:51
set up advanced budgets,

Unknown Speaker  48:01
there's the advanced budgets information,

Unknown Speaker  48:06
that's just materials.

Speaker 4  48:10
Yes, that's just materials. And I come up to setup,

Unknown Speaker  48:24
keyword purchase orders.

Unknown Speaker  48:36
Change,

Unknown Speaker  48:40
where is the

Unknown Speaker  48:49
entry?

Speaker 4  48:58
Well, if I come into cost caves. It shows the quantity, the labor, hours, budget, next tab over. Mean where I'm covering that up now.

Unknown Speaker  49:14
Yeah, okay, yeah, here we are.

Speaker 4  49:18
There you go. That's what we're after, gotcha.

Matthias Miller  49:22
Okay, so,

Unknown Speaker  49:25
and where's that map doing foundation?

Speaker 1  49:28
Well, I think we have a problem between, between heavy bid, heavy job and foundation, because already what's coming out of heavy bid is not, is not the they're not mapping the same, and we can change it on one end or another. So I I think that's something we need to dig into. But there's

Unknown Speaker  49:55
Where's it go in the foundation.

Matthias Miller  49:59
So in my note. I've got an original contract and original estimated cost in found in foundation.

Speaker 1  50:06
Yes, and the only thing that goes to Bruce, tell me, if I'm these numbers

Speaker 3  50:15
pull in to the cost code, budget in foundation, but that's my import cost codes, but that's not a revenue number, right? The revenue number, I don't get anywhere in heavy job. So where does that come from? I go looking for a contract or say, okay, mark somebody, give me a contract number, okay?

Speaker 1  50:40
And that should come from heavy bid, but I don't think there's any place in in heavy job.

Speaker 4  50:48
They'll give you revenue accounts, right?

Unknown Speaker  50:51
Let me tell you.

Speaker 3  51:07
No, it's got the total dollars, total cost,

Unknown Speaker  51:13
yeah, but it's cost, it's not revenue,

Unknown Speaker  51:17
yeah, revenue, I don't get out of here.

Speaker 1  51:19
Okay, so it sounds like revenue is going to come from someplace besides versus know how to chase it down.

Speaker 2  51:28
It's probably not worth trying to chase doing it on the back end. Interesting stuff there. But then for the

Matthias Miller  51:39
original estimated cost, would you want to just pull the sum of just pull the sum of the budget?

Speaker 2  51:47
Do we have any way to break it out in foundation and labor, equipment, materials?

Speaker 3  51:52
It pulls that into the Cost Codes again, but that doesn't update the and foundation that on jobs, that original estimated cost, those can be two different numbers. Okay,

Matthias Miller  52:15
so do we? I'm not sure if I followed all that can original estimated cost come across or not,

Speaker 1  52:25
it would be this. It would be the sum of the labor, the equipment, the material, subs. It'd be the total call, yes, it'd be the sum.

Unknown Speaker  52:36
But cost, it

Speaker 1  52:40
already is well, that's already taken care of, but there's a line in it. There's a line in foundation that there's a line in foundation for original estimated cost, which the uh,

Speaker 2  53:03
if we had separate cascades for change orders, we could

Speaker 1  53:09
do that. You would have to push them through, but it we would have to, but that's not an original estimated cost.

Unknown Speaker  53:17
Well, there's two right though

Speaker 4  53:19
there's your original estimated and there's a another dollars amount,

Unknown Speaker  53:26
right? That is just

Speaker 1  53:30
the original estimate. Is the one time we got the job. Here's our estimated cost. Anything that changes in that is a change order that's changing it. Mm,

Speaker 3  53:48
where we've gone astray is when the the sum of those that originally did come in, then the total of all the cost codes and Foundation did match that number. But as one of them changes, it doesn't change the other

Unknown Speaker  54:06
okay, I Are we somewhat clear? So

Matthias Miller  54:12
original estimated cost we can, we can set the first time it comes over,

Unknown Speaker  54:18
and it will never change after that.

Matthias Miller  54:20
And then just if it's as soon as it's been set, we would, we would never stop anything in there, right? So that sounds reasonable to me. Retainage percentage is that, is that here somewhere in in heavy job.

Speaker 1  54:37
Now, okay, it has the capability of being in heavy bid, but it's not, doesn't have, I don't think, Oh, one second, I should, I should. I should look before I just say, No, um.

Speaker 4  55:05
Advanced notes, extra work, advanced cost type.

Unknown Speaker  55:20
It's groups.

Speaker 1  55:32
I'm fairly confident that it does not show retainage in here, because this software is not designed for anything but tracking cost,

Matthias Miller  55:51
right? That would make sense. So that's a

Speaker 4  56:00
giggles. Let me see if it under customized, custom settings. I don't see anything that says you change.

Unknown Speaker  56:16
I would agree with that. Why it would be in there?

Speaker 1  56:18
Yeah. So that's going to have to be something that's manually set.

Matthias Miller  56:30
We have a rate job sets is always set to active when they're pulled in, always said the job type is always set to budget when it comes in. Is there a tax, tax exempt, but also probably be in in heavy bid, right?

Speaker 2  56:49
It's not a check box, it's a percentage, so you just change the permanent materials to zero. But

Matthias Miller  56:59
it's still coming from heavy bid, not heavy I mean, yes, yeah. So that would

Speaker 1  57:06
also be stuff like that is going to have to be entered in foundation.

Unknown Speaker  57:12
You can actually

Speaker 2  57:15
barely catch it on a screenshot that I sent you that heavy bid. The cost type is permanent materials. Tax is 0%

Speaker 1  57:28
sure. But the if it won't pass through heavy job, and then it's going to have to be free handed, which that's very, very minor. So we get, we get down to that, I'll be delighted.

Matthias Miller  57:44
Well, I mean, and if, if we get down to that, we're twiddling our thumbs, there's still a world of possibility of sinking from heavy bid to foundation for, for, you know, yeah, revenue style, numbers, cost, okay, then budgets. So here we have the budget is the cost code, a direct map to the cost no. Cost class is a category, right?

Speaker 1  58:16
Cost class would be like labor, equipment, material, subs.

Matthias Miller  58:21
What is cost class and foundation?

Speaker 3  58:27
What is cost class? I mean Foundation has cost classes. You're going to drive now. I

Matthias Miller  58:35
mean Foundation has has budgets of some kind with a cost class estimate dollars and a units of measure, which we're not using.

Speaker 4  58:50
I don't know you're driving, though.

Unknown Speaker  59:01
Yeah, those are my cost classes. Right now we're

Unknown Speaker  59:03
nowhere. So cost classes

Speaker 1  59:08
in foundation, we have labor, materials, subs, equipment, rented equipment, burden, outside services, hauling, burden, slash or dash, equipment and quantity. What is, I don't know,

Unknown Speaker  59:22
it just picks the unit.

Unknown Speaker  59:27
And

Speaker 1  59:29
that would cost class, though, that doesn't that would tie into the, yeah, to what we're looking at up there.

Matthias Miller  59:38
Okay, so labor would map to labor equipment would be to equipment, material to materials, yep, sub to subs, yeah, supply to well, nothing, nothing. And then. Miscellaneous one.

Speaker 1  1:00:02
To what that is? A good question. Miscellaneous one is set up, coming from heavy bid, and I think that is, let me see if I can figure it out.

Speaker 4  1:00:15
Why can I not find the screen that I'm sharing? Is that equipment? Pardon? Okay, I'm on the same one here,

Unknown Speaker  1:00:24
miscellaneous one.

Speaker 4  1:00:30
I'm trying to think, if I can, well, here I know one pipe demo, 90 lineal feet. Let's go see if we can figure out the demo,

Unknown Speaker  1:00:50
custom settings.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:57
What was that? Miscellaneous,

Unknown Speaker  1:01:01
equipment, rental,

Speaker 4  1:01:04
okay, I'm going to go open up. What was that? Pipe demo?

Unknown Speaker  1:01:11
Let me

Unknown Speaker  1:01:13
dairy entry. Do

Unknown Speaker  1:01:26
demo,

Unknown Speaker  1:01:30
okay,

Speaker 4  1:01:31
I think if I right click on it been a little while since I've done this. There's a way that I can get some information from it. Oh, there it is. It's in new and estimate resources.

Speaker 1  1:01:54
There it is, calling sub hourly, granular backfill labor and equipment. But I'm not sure which is map and where, but it's got to be an other resource

Speaker 3  1:02:17
I've done if I could figure out the foundation and what when it's importing that,

Unknown Speaker  1:02:24
where's the dump things come through?

Speaker 2  1:02:27
Good question, because there is

Unknown Speaker  1:02:30
dump fees on this in hauling.

Unknown Speaker  1:02:36
Yeah, I think hauling is one of them. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:02:39
I'm pretty sure that's what it is. I'm walking through the estimate right now.

Speaker 5  1:02:48
Well, there's some in good, but

Speaker 4  1:02:52
we got the backfill material on the hauling sub down here, but that the backfill material should come in as a sub

Speaker 1  1:03:02
good. We need to ask that question I had, we can? We would have to open a heavy bid. And kind of you got heavy bid open,

Unknown Speaker  1:03:14
trying

Unknown Speaker  1:03:16
to de equivate, uh,

Unknown Speaker  1:03:25
uh, that's heavy job, yeah.

Speaker 1  1:03:28
Okay, so interior, Yeah, but see, there's multiple ones year round. There's

Speaker 2  1:03:35
three bid items or, or, sorry, that one bit item is the same. It's a 90 line output. That's the same thing,

Speaker 1  1:03:43
okay? It's, it's mapping it somehow or another. I just don't know, pretty sure it's either hauling or concrete sawing. Is a sub? Well, yeah, that goes into all, yeah, that goes forward. It was in the cell.

Speaker 4  1:03:59
Don't be as a separate one. But what's the code on the W? Is that seven? That's going to be one of them? Yeah, so any fours would go to subs. Let me look up here.

Speaker 2  1:04:14
What's the what's the code on all that's six, isn't it? It's column number six, column number seven. Go back to your

Unknown Speaker  1:04:25
go back to that call. That's what it is.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:32
His materials at two. Yeah, it's hauling and hauling and dump fees somehow or another. Not sure which one,

Unknown Speaker  1:04:46
and there's an overhead number in here too.

Speaker 1  1:04:49
Yeah. So we're going to have to verify that. Spell that out. Ryan will dig into that one.

Matthias Miller  1:05:02
And then UDF coming out of, does that come out of heavy job in some capacity, or can we pull that, we talked

Speaker 1  1:05:16
like salvage value that would, that would be entered in foundation, and it won't go any place other than e3, 60, which the user defined field, right? But, I mean, there

Matthias Miller  1:05:39
wasn't this. This was on the foundation jobs. I don't even know it was something, something to be potentially pulled in via the cost code or some other reporting. And I'm not sure what that was in Foundation.

Speaker 3  1:05:50
The Job UDFs are, are the the classifications,

Unknown Speaker  1:05:56
oh yes, yes, forgot about that. I don't

Speaker 3  1:06:02
think they're anywhere from heavy job,

Unknown Speaker  1:06:09
I don't know how they would,

Speaker 3  1:06:12
because that's one I have to do the report, and either your dad or Nathan says, splits it up X percent for if you got a jobs,

Matthias Miller  1:06:30
that's That's it. And we were talking about, maybe, I don't remember, the full conversation about maybe finding a way to pull that report assign some percentages I don't even know, pulling Cost Codes. I don't know exactly what it was, but if we want to keep that, I mean, we can,

Speaker 1  1:06:51
that would have to bypass. That would have to come from heavy bid. Let's put, let's put that on the this would be nice, but not necessary for the initial import, export, sink, whatever we want to call it, that that would come directly from heavy bid. Heavy job does not have that

Speaker 3  1:07:18
capability. I'm not sure Nathan pulls it

Speaker 1  1:07:21
out, he doesn't. But that's not because we can't do it. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:07:27
we just don't well,

Matthias Miller  1:07:33
I mean, we don't want Bruce's life to be too easy,

Speaker 3  1:07:35
exactly, exactly

Speaker 1  1:07:41
everything that I go to do here, I pick up one rock and I find two more rocks underneath that rock, so I don't think we'll get to The point of not knowing what to do.

Matthias Miller  1:07:58
Understand, I um, I have there. There are definite times when projects like these can be somewhat akin to, ah, let me just go remodel this. You know, fill in the fill in the blank room in my house. What could possibly go wrong,

Speaker 1  1:08:16
right, right. Why didn't I just tear down and start over Rylan just bought a place not too long ago, so he's in the start of that remodel.

Speaker 2  1:08:28
Yeah, back to the point where it's like, oh no.

Matthias Miller  1:08:34
I've heard it said that the pattern of success in anything of life, it isn't for whatever you think of the guy, Alex, Alex or mosey, collects a whole bunch of interesting, interesting thoughts. But there's always, there's always uninformed optimism at the beginning, like, oh, how bad can it be? And then there's, there's informed pessimism. And that's like, that's when you want to go jump, jump the fence and go play greener grass. Yeah, gotta be better.

Speaker 1  1:09:04
And then for the pessimism, yeah, that's probably where Ryan's at right now. Never gonna pay for this. I don't know how the world I'm gonna do this.

Matthias Miller  1:09:19
Oh goodness. All right. Well, okay, so the big, the big, the big rock we haven't even begun to, we haven't begun to deal with has been change orders. We

Speaker 2  1:09:39
should probably just keep it that way until you get period. What's going on with

Speaker 1  1:09:43
them well. So so let's try and talk through change orders again. Just see if we're still on the same rock so we have multiple issues. Let's forget what we're doing now. Now, but let's say what we want to do is a change order will be created in heavy bid, and that will be it's somehow needs to get to Foundation project HQ, with the labor dollars, the equipment dollars, the sub dollars, the information that we need, then we need to send that over to the somebody to approve it, or to

Unknown Speaker  1:10:38
can it.

Speaker 1  1:10:40
If it's approved, it's already in Project HQ, it gets pushed to Foundation, and it also needs to push from heavy bid into heavy job. So it's a step one is creating the estimate. Step two is, yes, go ahead and do it,

Unknown Speaker  1:11:09
and then getting it,

Speaker 1  1:11:13
getting everything where it needs to be, now to complicate it more, as if we need that to complicate it more change order can be something totally different than what we're doing on the site, or it can just be more of what we are already doing. So for example, if it's something totally different, it's a new cost code that we get pushed from heavy bid to heavy job, which would add a cost code in foundation. If it's something that we're already doing, it's not going to change the cost code, but it's going to change the quantity and all the dollars of the cost code, which needs to get updated in foundation. Also,

Unknown Speaker  1:12:02
I wouldn't you just create a new costume?

Speaker 1  1:12:06
Because in found, you know, if it's sanitary sewer, we've got 500 feet on it, and they want to add another 100 feet. So they're going to add a they're going to add 100 feet of sanitary and they're going to add one manhole. So we have a cost code already for sanitary 12 inch. We've got a cost code for sanitary manholes. We don't want to add two more cost codes for that. We just want to change the quantities of the ones that we have so that when they're tracking them in the field, they're tracking them against the same one. And same way on in foundation. You don't want more cost codes. You just want the right number for what we're doing. A really foundation. You don't care. Yeah, as long as it comes through and it gets applied to the right place,

Matthias Miller  1:12:57
would that be? Is it coming across into foundation in the budget, or where does it get pushed across to found foundation.

Speaker 1  1:13:06
This is getting above my pay grade because we're not using it this way right now. I kind of sort of have the concept of where it needs to go. But in foundation, when we push a cost, a change order up into found from Project HQ. We push it up into Foundation. We can select, we break it down by the the cost types, labor, equipment, material, subs, hauling, etc and etc, etc. We can also assign that cost to a specific cost cost code.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:44
So it's kind of,

Speaker 3  1:13:48
I think, and yeah, I'm not clear on it either, but I think the change orders that are coming over from project are not changing the cost codes in the job maintenance screen. I think it's changing. It's the cost codes and

Speaker 2  1:14:11
share the screen anyway, the change orders not Yeah, go

Unknown Speaker  1:14:20
ahead, yeah. That again.

Matthias Miller  1:14:25
I think another way to ask the question, it would be,

Speaker 2  1:14:31
yeah, so I'm in heavy bed here, just so you can see a little bit more. But Get that thing out there. I have the estimate type drop down so that had that could be changed to push to whatever we want to. And then we do have these UDFs over here that we could set up. I don't I. Don't know how, what, where we could do that,

Unknown Speaker  1:15:07
but, yeah,

Speaker 2  1:15:09
just a little bit more for you, rather than that little tiny screenshot.

Matthias Miller  1:15:16
Okay, let's take, let's take two giant steps back. We need to, we say we need to map out the various types of change orders and how they need to, need to flow. There's some missing information in terms of business process. I would say that if, if Bruce river is responsible for this, can reasonably write out some form of an SOP, even if it's back of the napkin, verbal communication of this is what this is. This is exactly how the process works. Then we're in the ballpark of looking to automate it. But if we're, if there's still a lot of manual efforts and uncertainty and well, it kind of, it kind of works this way most of the time, sort of, except for these half a dozen cases that happen pretty regularly. We're going to have real we're going to have real trouble with that.

Speaker 1  1:16:12
Yeah, I think you're right. I think that's one of those that that's not low hanging fruit. We need to, we need to get some things fixed. And then let's move on to standardizing exactly how we do these. I was just I can pull up here on Project HQ and show you what we can do on the change orders. But I think what you just said, Yeah, we don't have an SOP. We don't have an SOP, and we're not, we're not close to having one.

Speaker 5  1:16:48
Let's, let's table. That sounds good.

Matthias Miller  1:16:57
Do you have any insight on tackling do we want to tackle time off, or is that a sometime down the road in the future? We think that's

Speaker 1  1:17:08
we do not want to tackle time off. We have an alternate that we're working on right now. Wonderful. All

Matthias Miller  1:17:21
right, so cross your fingers, but exactly Thank you. I think we're, I mean, I think this puts us in a position where we can, we can start having some very specific conversations around these are exactly the fields that we need to pull out from heavy bid, heavy job. And this is exactly what you said in 360 etc. And and start taking a look, at least from a I think it's, I think it would be, well, start looking at what kind of tools they three, 360 is kind of the big wild card. But what kind of tools do we actually have to pull data, move data around?

Speaker 1  1:18:33
So what's the next step of that is that involving heavy or HCSS in a in a

Unknown Speaker  1:18:43
zoom call.

Matthias Miller  1:18:46
Yeah, do you know offhand is HCSS? Does that include third party, like, imports, exports, sorry, HCSS is the company, but the syncing tool? Yeah, I think so it is. It's evolving them.

Speaker 1  1:19:01
And also good. I I'm confident that we can get somebody set up with that. Basically, it'd be a custom their custom software department. And I've talked to them already, and they basically said, Yeah, you tell us what you want, and either it's available or, yeah, it's available for a price.

Speaker 2  1:19:25
Do we want to talk to foundation first, though, because they're going to be the ones that are pickier.

Speaker 1  1:19:30
Well, I think from Foundation, we've we've learned they're not going to do anything other than, you know, write scripts is about the only thing Foundation's willing to do.

Speaker 2  1:19:41
So if we can't get data in or out of there, it doesn't really matter if HCS has to

Unknown Speaker  1:19:45
do anything, but we can, we can get it out.

Matthias Miller  1:19:52
Go ahead. Do you know anything about so foundation is on prem, right? On, what is it? It's on prem, you got your it's on one of your servers. Cloud based,

Speaker 1  1:20:10
your foundation. Correct, correct, yeah, foundations, cloud based, heavy job is currently on premises, and e3 60 is currently on premises.

Matthias Miller  1:20:41
Okay, let me, let me go back, because I know I had some notes on some of this stuff.

Speaker 1  1:20:46
Let me, it feels, feels to me like the next step is to involve HCSS. You know, we've asked good questions. We we know where we're

Speaker 2  1:20:55
at. I guess what I'm what I'm saying is we know HCSS, we can work with foundation. So far, we don't hardly think they will right. So that needs to be the if they won't do anything, then it doesn't matter how much we talk to HCSS Right

Speaker 1  1:21:13
Foundation, we can import and we can export.

Speaker 4  1:21:18
So it's you know whether it's

Unknown Speaker  1:21:24
import and export, what

Unknown Speaker  1:21:26
though, CSBs, etc and etc, etc, yeah, to one of the degrees we can export, no problem. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:21:45
So okay, here's, here's the thing. I found some some clues online that seemed to indicate that foundation may have some kind of API. I vote. I mean, I guess we can decide at what point we want to do, what we want to do, but

Matthias Miller  1:22:14
okay, in our last call with foundation, the big roadblock was, well, you need to tell us specifically what you want to do. Well, we now know specifically what we want to do, and we also know that there appears to be conversation online that indicates that foundation does have some kind of an API. And so I would probably

Unknown Speaker  1:22:39
vote

Matthias Miller  1:22:41
when dealing with with foundation, I would probably encourage me, and I don't know, chat or who all should be on that call, but But find some form of

Matthias Miller  1:23:02
I'm not saying don't take no for Well, I am kind of saying don't take no for an answer, like, don't be at least give us a good answer. Why? I mean, give us better answers than what we've been getting, please, yeah, and see if we can move up the chain until we can get that. I

Speaker 1  1:23:23
uh, it let me, let me start chasing down a good contact at foundation through HCSS, because they they have people that have been working with foundation for years. We don't want to get the guy that we got last time on the custom development side. That was, yeah, if he was standing, standing on the chair, he's he'd still look up to himself.

Speaker 1  1:24:01
The or the, I know enough of the guys down at HCSS, I think I can, I can get get up higher, instead of having to work our way up from the bottom, yeah. Let, let me work on that, yep. And then if we can get in, basically, I mean, okay, so we'll pay a couple of bucks an hour, but whatever we may as well, if we can find somebody that can give us some answers, that's fine. So Okay, I will, I will chase that down.

Unknown Speaker  1:24:42
Yep,

Speaker 1  1:24:43
better make the note on there says Chad said he will chase it down

Matthias Miller  1:24:50
here. Next steps, we're gonna um.

Matthias Miller  1:25:05
Yeah. I mean, I don't think it's, I mean, to rylan's point, if you're talking theories of constraints, if we can't integrate with foundation in any way, I mean, you can, there always is a way. I don't think we want to, I don't think we want to write bots to do it all, but there is a way. But if it's not viable, then we're going to have to take a look at what all this ends up looking like.

Speaker 1  1:25:38
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm I mean, as far as if we can, if we can get this set up in foundation, worst case scenario is it's an import export routine, well, but can you import, export everything that we're trying to import export is, that's a lot of data. It's not just five or six fields and user defined, I don't know. Yeah, I

Unknown Speaker  1:26:05
that's my concern.

Speaker 1  1:26:07
The I know the first thing that we have to do is we have to get the data the same. You know, we can't call it one thing in one software and another thing in another software.

Unknown Speaker  1:26:18
So, okay, let me do that here.

Unknown Speaker  1:26:34
Keep thinking there's a car going by every time

Speaker 1  1:26:41
that car that's going away. It's like it's 1000 miles away.

Matthias Miller  1:26:47
I'm using the wrong it's using my laptop mic. That's why it's allowed for you. We'll try we'll try this instead. No,

Speaker 1  1:26:54
there's cars going by outside your window behind, yeah.

Speaker 3  1:27:01
Tree, man, yeah, that's right, the trees back here looks like the trees. Yeah, good, so

Speaker 1  1:27:20
let me chase that down, and I'll, as soon as I get some information, I'll, I'll fire it away, and then we'll figure out from that what our next step is, correct. Correct. Okay, balls in my court, balls in your court. Got it. Dupes traveling.

Unknown Speaker  1:27:41
Okay. Good.

Speaker 1  1:27:43
I feel like we're making progress. At least we know what we did more than we did now.

Matthias Miller  1:27:48
So, yeah, I mean, we've, like you said, we've, we've kicked over a bunch of rocks, and we have some definitive, definitive questions to ask and and very, very answerable questions, can you do this or not? Yeah, and we can also talk about and even on the automation side, you guys are welcome to use their consultants to do the automation. I know codecrafters also has a team member that could be a good fit for for coding the coding and maintaining the automations as well. So yeah,

Speaker 1  1:28:27
well, let's figure out what we need to do first and then go there. Question for you. I just thought about, I need somebody that is really, really good with Excel, that could take three or four Excel spreadsheets and combine them into one. You know, each one of them's got some of the same data and some of the different data is that something that is, you've got somebody on staff or something that would be a good fit for that?

Matthias Miller  1:29:07
Yes, potentially, I've got one person on staff or a person I could bring in to do it.

Unknown Speaker  1:29:19
Could you

Matthias Miller  1:29:24
easiest thing would be, okay, there's, I mean, the straight up, easiest thing would be, if you could, if you have the Excel files and can, can outline how you want to pull together, and

Unknown Speaker  1:29:39
then I can? Yeah,

Speaker 1  1:29:41
I think I can, and I've been working on them. But essentially, essentially, once I get this file all set up with the infra, combined information out of its combined information, out of foundation, e3, 60, a time and material, spreadsheet. Eight it. Once I get that all combined into it, then foundation will write that script to load it into Foundation, and my common denominator is the equipment ID or asset number. And once it's in there, then it can be sent out, and we can repopulate e3 60 and repopulate heavy job. I'm, yeah, I I've got a long ways to go, but I'm a way of a lot closer than I was. So now I'm sitting here going, Okay, I think I've got these kind of lined out now we just need to mesh them all together to where one sheet has all the information on it instead of three different sheets. So, okay, I just thought about that, so that's that's a side issue, but okay, well, thank you.

Matthias Miller  1:30:53
Sounds good. Thank you guys. Have a good afternoon and a good weekend. Yeah, you do. Thanks. Bye.
