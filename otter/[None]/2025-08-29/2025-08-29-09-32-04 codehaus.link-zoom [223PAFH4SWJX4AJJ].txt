Unknown Speaker  00:19
Believe it I think

Unknown Speaker  02:35
Take care. Yes,

Unknown Speaker  03:57
got me.

Speaker 1  03:59
Yo Sorry, dude. I'm not sure what happened there. I anyway, um, are we screen share or just,

Unknown Speaker  04:11
do we? Yeah, what do you

Matthias Miller  04:16
we talked about touching base today if you need

Speaker 1  04:17
anything. No, that's good. That's good. I think

Matthias Miller  04:21
John had some. John had some questions at some point. I messaged him about his schedule today, but haven't heard he messaged texted me yesterday, but and I was,

Speaker 1  04:32
well, I can run through some of the I mean, I think I have a good idea what um Do you want to go through the things that we need, or however? Um, what? What are you thinking? Um, well, yeah, there's some technical things that are go that are going on there with. With it. Um, let's see if I can release. Hang on, sorry. What am I doing wrong?

Unknown Speaker  05:15
Can't tell you that.

Speaker 1  05:16
There you go. Here we go. There you are. I'm sorry. Um, can we screen share or not? Yeah, yeah, oh, okay, I didn't know. I'm sorry, yeah, I don't see the option on the like, it usually pops up. Sorry, where's it at here? And usually, oh, here it is. I'm not sure what happened, but yep, okay,

Speaker 2  05:47
all right, so get out of the way,

Unknown Speaker  05:59
boss.

Speaker 1  06:02
All right. Matt extension, okay, I was trying to do some stuff. John gave me all numbers, um, if you go, if we go here to the warnings page, yep, um, and then down here, this is probably an easy one, but these items below, there's a bunch of lumber, high lumber, high lumber. I went into a couple, and they did not they the the box of non assembly was not checked, okay? And as far as I know, when I checked that box, they came off this list. Does that seem accurate?

Speaker 3  06:47
Like that's what it that's what I would expect? Yeah, yeah. Okay, so

Speaker 1  06:52
there's a number of those, um, the when I in this page, Matt, we I think we used to be able to go to the item when we clicked on this item code, but right now, it doesn't. It doesn't take so, like, if I click on here, double click, I'm not just doesn't show me anything. So,

Matthias Miller  07:21
because it's, it's because we don't, I mean, we have any work orders for that item.

Speaker 1  07:26
Is that what it is? Well, yeah, let me go back. How do I,

Matthias Miller  07:30
um, you're looking to edit the item from here.

Speaker 1  07:34
I, I guess that's what I'm thinking. Like, okay, if I do this, for example, I know these NH numbers like this, NH, 70270, for example, is one. It's a stock item. And there's also a heat treated sage number, right? So to clean up all of these, um, I had to go, like, I went down and I found there's a heat treated number in here somewhere. So then I'm gonna look at all the dates, like we just took inventory yesterday of that item. So I'm gonna go down here. I'm gonna look at the latest date. I'm going to, I want to go to the work order for that item, um, because then I want to, I want to leave, sorry, like off of, off of their the last quota that was assembled. I'm going to, I'm going to leave the inventory amount as inventory, but I'm going to allot the rest of their last assembly to the latest sage orders, and then I'm going to go back through and knock out sage orders, and I'll go to the the Second latest work order, and I must just start assigning the, you know what? I mean, the somewhat items, to the at the end of the day. We don't have to go all the way back, but, I mean, we'll have to go back at least Psalm. I mean, that makes sense.

Unknown Speaker  09:16
Yeah. How do

Speaker 1  09:19
I get to that? How do I go from this page? What's the easiest way go from this page to the work orders, or latest you

Matthias Miller  09:29
should you should be able just to click the item code to go to the work orders. Well,

Unknown Speaker  09:33
that, but that's not unless, if I click this item code, I

Speaker 2  09:43
Well, there what happened. We have, we have one,

Speaker 1  09:47
right? And that's probably the only one since the the June 26 so I can start mess. I can start with that, right? Mm. And then if I do this, well, I have to open this right now. I have to work order. Double click that. Okay, there's the work order. So did 208

Unknown Speaker  10:20
so you were hit, but crazy, see the

Unknown Speaker  10:30
they've already been assigned,

Unknown Speaker  10:33
but it's not,

Unknown Speaker  10:39
um, shoot.

Unknown Speaker  10:45
So there's an 815, Sage order, but if I that's not how many? Sorry,

Matthias Miller  10:56
okay, so how many do you have in stock?

Unknown Speaker  11:01
Uh, what is the number here? He got 209 in stock.

Matthias Miller  11:07
Well, so this whole order needs to be stock, right? So just drop down the list and select the blank row,

Unknown Speaker  11:19
right here. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  11:22
hit save.

Speaker 1  11:24
And there's no, I mean, because, well, we already know it's a stock item and,

Unknown Speaker  11:32
well, I guess we do. Let

Speaker 1  11:36
me hit save, ignorant save, um, so I go to the item, check that, yeah, go to go, yeah, man, I need a, I need a goober here, dude. I need a good goober here, man, you know that? I guess by now I apologize for yesterday, a little bit

Unknown Speaker  12:09
like I talked to

Unknown Speaker  12:13
I talked to Rick, a little bit afterwards,

Unknown Speaker  12:16
I was like, Hey,

Speaker 1  12:19
you were laughing too about some things. You know, I said, nobody's laughing at anybody, as far as I know, including you. But I might,

Matthias Miller  12:33
I'm I'm offended by nothing, and, no, I have, and I want to make sure that. I mean, I don't want to, I don't know, I

Speaker 1  12:43
get it. I guess I'm apologizing for our stupidity like I

Matthias Miller  12:51
don't feel like you need to, but I will still accept, I mean, I happy to accept it. I guess

Speaker 1  13:00
I just think to do, to do things the right way, makes so much sense. I just need to keep standing up as a leader and

Unknown Speaker  13:15
accountability makes

Matthias Miller  13:18
sense to me. Yeah. I mean the fact that I'm not surprised that sage doesn't let you or modify the order inventory, although you should be able to have a back order quantity or something of some kind. Anyway, yeah, to me, it was just, I kind of got hit straight upside the head with the big holes in the logic. And I just

Speaker 1  13:41
like, anyway, well, I know that's why I knew. That's why you were laughing. I was laughing, but

Unknown Speaker  13:48
I was anyway,

Unknown Speaker  13:51
uh, fun times.

Speaker 1  13:53
Did you see my email to Rick Hartman? And then I finally responded. I thought I was going back through. I'm just not very timely on emails, but I, I do try to, was it, yeah, accurate launch, right? Yep, um, anyway, so, yeah. So I'm, I'm getting challenged here by the by these coaches in in the evaluation, to to work on trust and make sure people are good, and like some people need some healing and yada yada. So I'm trying to humble myself and walk through some of that and having more on my conversations with individuals and and that's all I think, of course, those things are necessary, but at the end of the day, I still know this. I mean, I knew this way back that accountability is like, there's just some silos, such as people that want to. Kind of self protect, you know, and that just I, for whatever reason, the good Lord has me in a situation and for me to, for me to and maybe it's just not going to change until I'm willing to take that step, but for me to really, because I've seen how much pushback happens when somebody gets just challenged on a small thing. And it's just it's, of course, easier to try to work around that and be like, Yo, yeah, you know, this person has value, and we need to be patient and loving and but then there's the other side, where it's more and more. I'm like, it would just be so refreshing and so easy, just to start with a clean slate and one or two spots, yeah, but then it's, then I don't know who's that person. If I would know who the person is and the person would be committed, I would not. I would, I would quickly. I would want to quickly move in that direction

Unknown Speaker  16:19
to where I'm at

Speaker 1  16:24
anyway. Sorry, getting lost in the shuffle here. Um, continue understand, um. Now if I click on here, what are we saying? Make this a stock items. Make it a stock item. And that's it. That's

Unknown Speaker  16:38
it. Hit, save. I

Speaker 1  16:47
so now I go, where were we at? Go back to the

Unknown Speaker  17:06
oh, okay, so now we

Matthias Miller  17:07
have, are all the high are all the high lumber ones, no assembly,

Unknown Speaker  17:16
yes,

Speaker 1  17:19
and the swim at lumber. But I mean, all the lumber ones that say lumber or no assembly, all right, is there a quick way to do that? Or,

Unknown Speaker  17:32
yeah, there is

Speaker 1  17:34
okay. I mean, you're welcome to. I mean, there's probably lmbr, there's probably other ones throughout. And I don't know what they are, these are the most popular ones. But I mean, shoot, if you can, that's a cool that's a cool way

Unknown Speaker  17:50
to minus as well.

Unknown Speaker  17:53
I'm gonna go back in here on how much time do you have, Matt,

Matthias Miller  17:59
I got about until about 1230 Okay,

Unknown Speaker  18:04
should be great. Um,

Speaker 1  18:11
yeah, so there's no earlier. Can I talk about something else, right, right? You'll get Yeah, yeah. I don't want to disrupt whatever you're doing. If you are, um,

Unknown Speaker  18:23
yeah, you're good. Um,

Speaker 1  18:28
man, I gotta think, think straight here, so now that, now that I don't have any other work orders in the last two months, or almost two months now to assign these sage orders for this item means I have to go back past June 26 are we remind me what's the cleanup that we need to do back there?

Matthias Miller  19:06
We need to clean up. We need to link partials to the finished product, and we make sure the the quantities are right.

Unknown Speaker  19:14
Um, partials,

Matthias Miller  19:17
okay, when, when you're when you start on day one, finish it on day two back

Unknown Speaker  19:22
in Excel, yeah, sure.

Speaker 1  19:27
Is there? A lot of you said there's a lot of cleanup, yep. And is that starting in, I guess, starting in 2024 Yeah. Should we? Well, I kind of want to look at that with you. But Same time, same time, I might be able to get Amanda to work on some of this. Um,

Unknown Speaker  19:58
if I ask Rick, he's probably gonna.

Unknown Speaker  20:01
Yeah, it Yeah,

Matthias Miller  20:05
is there? I mean, I think, I think the, the biggest thing to me is, is action plan, um, so

Speaker 1  20:16
well again, if can I, well, sorry, let me back up. Let's go where we were. Yeah, like, if I on this page, can I click on the item number and it'll go to the work order?

Speaker 2  20:32
Yes, here. Okay, wait.

Speaker 1  20:35
Okay, that is right there. I gotcha. So it is working.

Matthias Miller  20:40
It's just when it's a weird thing, but when you don't have any work orders, both, both of them end up blank

Speaker 1  20:47
and under, yeah, understand. So because John was saying,

Unknown Speaker  21:01
there's a

Speaker 1  21:04
unattached orders won't open to specific work order page, but they will if there's work orders. We know they will if there's work orders. So like, yeah. So like, for example, if I go to the did you do the lumber thing already? Yep, nice, very nice. Um, high serve seven. Was another one. Let me look at that. Matt, uh, question we had, um, I say, We John and I slide serve. So I think that was yesterday, after you came off the call. Well, maybe that went away. Was that lumber probably was,

Unknown Speaker  22:01
yeah, it was, um,

Speaker 1  22:11
all right, I don't know question one away right now. So good enough. So

Speaker 2  22:25
go ahead, trying

Unknown Speaker  22:32
to think here, Matt like,

Unknown Speaker  22:39
I don't know this. Need. See

Unknown Speaker  22:43
like this. I'm

Speaker 1  22:49
sitting there thinking, How do I lead this and not not get involved with doing all the work myself?

Matthias Miller  22:56
Okay? I have, I have an idea. I don't know what you trying to think of this as feasible. The task is basically, go look at all work orders.

Speaker 2  23:14
What? But? But go ahead, give me this one. Should I be?

Matthias Miller  23:21
I shared a Google Sheet with you at some point.

Unknown Speaker  23:23
Yeah, you did, so I'll go there.

Speaker 1  23:30
Sorry, I'm Come on, come on. Don't, don't.

Unknown Speaker  23:39
Wait a minute.

Unknown Speaker  23:42
Wait a minute with the new way

Matthias Miller  23:50
that we're handling partials, we can we should now be able to import all the old data and link them together and clean them up in silver loom. Okay.

Matthias Miller  24:16
And so what you would what you would probably end up doing, sorry, I'm having an old hard time standing still. I'm tired of sitting

Unknown Speaker  24:23
you're good. You're good. Don't worry about that.

Matthias Miller  24:27
So what like? I wonder if, between some custom reports and stuff, because I was thinking about this on the Excel site, it would be nice to know which items are stock items, because that's going to affect how these things come. You get tied out. But if, if you get all these imported, and if you had a way to look at this item by item, like if, if part of your screen would be. Okay, the work orders for this item. And the other part of your screen would be the sales order, yeah. Then you could tie you could you could start figuring out, like, well, this is, like, here's the total. You could group it by, I don't know how you want to group it. You don't, probably don't want

Speaker 2  25:21
to group it by month. Oh, but

Matthias Miller  25:28
you could maybe come up with a a workflow that makes a little bit easier, yeah,

Speaker 1  25:35
yeah. I mean, if Yeah, because if we can, if we can center on that item, clean up work orders, jump over, look at Sage orders. Just kind of be able to,

Matthias Miller  25:51
yeah, I mean, in some ways it would almost be easier. We said we don't need to tie it out to sales orders. I don't know if this makes it too complicated or it's too I mean, it's a, it's a pretty invasive process. I'll throw this out as a scenario. I've got a, I don't know that this makes sense. So this is just a crazy hair brain idea. I have a part time assistant who has a business administration degree and is wants to work from home, has available hours, does accounting for parents business and is detail oriented, thorough and conscientious, and if there's a way we could delegate this task down to, I don't know what I probably need to build, I'd be fine billing her time at something like 30 an hour or something to cover, to Cover, whatever needs to happen. But for for, I can't imagine that, and I don't know what it is, but it's 4000 items.

Matthias Miller  27:15
I mean, I would think that, I would think we could make some huge dents on it. With, with, like, I don't know, 40 to 80 hours of work on it from somebody who's just full on, focused on cranking through it. I should have, I mean, I have, if you have capacity on your end, let's do it there. Yeah, Amanda,

Speaker 1  27:35
can do a lot of that. I'm not, not, not that you're I appreciate your idea that could be a good option.

Matthias Miller  27:43
I'm not attached to it. If you've got a capacity through Amanda, let's come up with a workflow that works for Amanda, then to to tie these out, and it might be some custom reports that we put together

Unknown Speaker  28:01
just for her. Yes,

Unknown Speaker  28:06
well so right now, without going into

Matthias Miller  28:29
hmm, I don't know if it's you or me. One of us is

Unknown Speaker  28:36
breaking up. Oh,

Unknown Speaker  29:19
let me, let me see. If I can, I can maybe send you the let me see if I can

Speaker 1  29:23
look up the link. You there. Yep, I'm here. Oh, my, it was my side on the internet service. All right. What was that? I don't remember that email or when, or let me see if I can see if I can find

Unknown Speaker  29:51
it all right.

Matthias Miller  29:57
I'm replying to it now. It was sent on August. If

Speaker 1  30:09
there I got it. Lost you on the Zoom again. Where are we at here? What

Unknown Speaker  30:24
Yeah, got it. Um,

Unknown Speaker  30:29
why can't I have them both open at the same time? Do not know.

Unknown Speaker  30:37
Oh, here we go,

Speaker 1  30:41
man, I have it, um, here, okay, this, I

Unknown Speaker  31:03
What? So I think,

Matthias Miller  31:08
I think we could, actually,

Unknown Speaker  31:14
I don't know,

Matthias Miller  31:19
like we got to clean up anything with quantity or notes and just make sure that they're they're right, but if we would,

Speaker 1  31:38
what was Yeah, So you're saying it was when there was no quantity.

Matthias Miller  31:45
The quantity wasn't valid. So sometimes he would put in like, wasn't just a straight number, like,

Unknown Speaker  31:51
Yeah, where's that? What?

Speaker 1  32:00
Room when the quantity wasn't valid. Like, sorry, how. How did we know that? Like, if the

Matthias Miller  32:09
I just mean, like, sometimes in the quantity, let me see if I can find one, uh, like, on row, where was I? 5727 the quantity says 172

Unknown Speaker  32:35
mats only, column y5.

Speaker 1  32:45
727, column y 172 Max only,

Unknown Speaker  32:58
right? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  33:04
so, but see that one's tight out? Well, no,

Unknown Speaker  33:10
he's seven. What? What? Sorry,

Speaker 1  33:14
I don't want to, I'm not trying to jump around. But what would happen if we'd migrate everything across

Matthias Miller  33:22
nothing? I mean, sure we can. We didn't used to, because we were trying to put them all in the same work order, but with how we're how we're doing partials. Now,

Speaker 1  33:33
would, would that? Would any of this clean up automatically because of the settings and everything that we have in there. Now, what? What if, um, I'm not, I'm not trying to, like whatever hope for miracles or whatever type of thing. I'm just,

Unknown Speaker  33:58
well, let me think

Matthias Miller  34:04
we're still gonna have a weird boundary at the beginning, like we're just moving part of the boundary problems to 2024 No, the big issue, okay, we got two issues. Number one, just completely bogus quantities, like especially these waves, you're gonna say you produced 210, to 30x which you actually produced, who knows, I don't know what,

Speaker 1  34:30
and, yeah, and the only way to shoot

Matthias Miller  34:37
now we could No, no, no, no, no. I don't know how precise you want to be, but what we said was, if any of them, we said on things like the wave, we're just going to group them out by year or by something like that.

Speaker 1  35:00
It can we, if we could mirror total order quantities to total assemble quantities like mirror that in a sort of a Work page like and do the same thing as we're doing on silver loom, but they do it in like a

Unknown Speaker  35:27
Yeah, where we have

Speaker 1  35:30
work orders, and down here we have sage orders. But can you go back that far? Yeah? Well, wouldn't that? I'm just thinking, wouldn't that be the easiest way to and then when there's discrepancies, you go into that work order and you correct what needs corrected. And I mean, yeah, it'd be really cool.

Unknown Speaker  36:03
Cool if

Speaker 1  36:06
all the, I mean, shoot, I guess if I Yeah, you're a genius. I mean, it'd be really cool if everything would auto feel like from the latest work, from the latest sage order, all the way back, unless it's an inventory item,

Matthias Miller  36:23
right? If you could, if you could populate it backwards, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  36:30
is that just,

Unknown Speaker  36:33
I don't know, Matt,

Unknown Speaker  36:35
I'm not sure.

Speaker 1  36:36
Like, if we can do it in five days manually, and it takes you a couple days to whatever, like, we'll just do the thing. But I'm just trying to,

Unknown Speaker  36:48
sorry, I don't know. No, it's fine. I'm just so I'm

Speaker 1  36:52
just trying to wrap my head around it, one way, one way or the other. I want to wrap my head around this thing and get it, get it done. I guess 1000s of items here. Where do I start?

Matthias Miller  37:09
Well, it's 1000s of well, how many 1000s of orders? It's 1000s of orders.

Speaker 1  37:17
It's all the orders, right? It is all the orders. Okay? So

Unknown Speaker  37:22
it's,

Unknown Speaker  37:26
we're just not sure if the quantities are accurate.

Speaker 2  37:31
It's 846 items, 345,

Matthias Miller  37:36
that were ordered during that time.

Speaker 1  37:39
But from from January 2024, to June, 23 25th right? Yeah. Was that? What you're saying? Yeah, to June, 25 of 2025. 845, items, okay,

Matthias Miller  38:04
so I wonder if, I mean, if the only thing we changed was had the bottom half of the screen,

Matthias Miller  38:19
the bottom half of the screen filtered, would filter down to the item, to the selected item,

Speaker 1  38:29
yeah, like, where you could, like, just that item, yeah, and

Matthias Miller  38:38
then maybe just, I don't Know, you may, you might want to change the sword so it sorts from oldest to newest, or something on the top

Unknown Speaker  38:50
left.

Matthias Miller  38:52
Or you would want them side by side. Is that? What you're thinking?

Unknown Speaker  38:58
What would be, sorry, what would be side by side. I think

Matthias Miller  39:02
if you have work orders in the top and and sales orders in the bottom,

Speaker 1  39:07
yeah, and it would just be that, it would be each specific item, just that item.

Matthias Miller  39:17
We would, we would automatically try to, we would, we would do, you know, adjacent weekdays, to tie them together automatically

Speaker 1  39:31
or or just go with latest latest, start with The latest on both sides and auto populate or populate.

Unknown Speaker  39:50
Well, if we would

Speaker 1  39:52
but, but if I would know before I do that, if I would be able to before that, I would want to know that, hey. There's not a huge like the amount assembled matches. If the amount assembled matches the amount sold, then we can, then we know with confidence that we can populate it, and it's going to be super close. And anything that's still, gosh, anything that's not reconciled once we go all the way back to January 120, 24 leave it in a, I mean, I don't know, just leave it, set it, whatever, and then I don't know, forget it is that am on the right track.

Matthias Miller  40:44
I think you're pretty optimistic about how clean the Excel data is.

Speaker 1  40:49
I might be and I So wait, okay, and that's but if the x, if there are variances in the sold amount and the assembled amount dating back to the January 2024 if there are variances, then I just need to go in comparing work orders to Sage orders. If work orders are on top of the screen, Sage orders are on the bottom. Yeah. I mean, just gotta sort of, then, then, then I can compare assemble date to order date, and when there's, you know, when it's just like, way off you then I know that whatever, if the order was for 100 on June of 2024 and there was 200 assembled in June of 2024 then I know I need to go into that work order and probably delete 100 mats and sides or whatever. You know, right?

Unknown Speaker  42:01
Yeah, so

Unknown Speaker  42:03
you are only looking to,

Speaker 1  42:11
well, remind me what, from your perspective on the Excel stuff, we need to clean up the quantities and we had said, when there were notes, there was probably issues right,

Matthias Miller  42:30
right? I mean, the biggest thing is we have to link multiple days together, and we got to clean up quantities, which basically comes down to cleaning up quantities

Unknown Speaker  42:39
so it if if,

Speaker 1  42:42
right, and if there's notes, we know there's ish issues, but that's if you migrate everything across. The notes will stay there, right? Yeah, the quantities will stay there. I could clean it up. I feel like I could clean it up quicker if everything was in one place, right?

Matthias Miller  43:01
Yeah, I would, I would agree. I would, I would rather move it across and get it cleaned up. I wonder if,

Speaker 1  43:09
well, is that going to mess with John current?

Matthias Miller  43:13
We'll, we'll, we'll just create, probably, we can create custom user reports that are often no man's land, and we'll get rid of them after we're done with the process, and it won't mess with him. Okay? So what we could do then is track the if we would group by month and a grand total both in the top and bottom

Unknown Speaker  43:50
and and

Matthias Miller  43:54
then you just got to go through 485, items. And, I mean, theoretically, we could give you a different another report that says, I'm not quite sure how to deal with the tail that we have at the end. That's the basic thing. What did, I guess?

Speaker 1  44:11
How do you mean by that? Sorry, elaborate on that a little bit till

Matthias Miller  44:16
like, like we have, I mean, we have sales orders that are in the old and the new. And I think basically what we'd have to what we probably should do, first of all, is import all the old stuff and tie them out to any sales, any sales order on or after June 23

Matthias Miller  44:47
or I guess what I'm after is there's not a clean boundary, like if you track a quantity assembled January to December, then there are some. Um, you know, especially, especially in December, there's some you'll have assembled for orders that aren't in that date range. And so,

Matthias Miller  45:15
okay, hang on, this is what you're saying. If we would,

Matthias Miller  45:22
what if we had some kind of logic that said we're going to group them together if they're all within a day of each other, and if the last quantity assembled, if there's a sales order that's due within a week after completion. That is for the same quantity as what was assembled. We automatically link out. I don't know that that helps us any I help, wouldn't I mean, that should help a lot.

Speaker 1  45:57
That should help a lot, seemingly, that would, that would take care of a bunch of items,

Matthias Miller  46:04
and then we would be start. And then we would filter down by what are the ones that don't have sales orders tied to them? And those are all problem ones, and what are unlinked sales orders, right?

Speaker 1  46:15
And you wouldn't anything that has a different number. You would you would not attack. You would not, you would not attach, right? If you reconciled everything with matching numbers within five working days, I'd say, I'd say, I mean, most of stuff is of three, but five would be a good number. Like, what would happen? What happens then, if there's an order for, uh, load on Tuesday, another load on Thursday, like there's some of that happens. Well,

Unknown Speaker  46:50
if they,

Matthias Miller  46:52
if they skip a day working on it, it would work fine. But if they work on it, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. Then we would assume that this is all one order. But then you you would, then you would come in and it's not tied out, and you're like, Oh, this is two work orders in one. Okay,

Speaker 1  47:11
we just figured out, yeah, no, we can, like, that would that would take care of a bunch of them, and then what's remaining? Would again, if there's a fairly easy if there's a way on that page, work orders on top, Sage orders on the bottom for that Item, yeah.

Speaker 1  47:37
I mean that would be, we is there, is there a simple way for me to go, like, to go here on the bottom and, like, grab all of these. And like, kind of, like,

Unknown Speaker  47:55
I don't know,

Unknown Speaker  47:59
make the windows. Sorry,

Unknown Speaker  48:02
don't make the make the way,

Speaker 1  48:04
make the window anyway. You know what? You know what we need. I, I'm, I'm not gonna try. Come on, let's do that. Um, but if it, yeah, if it would just be that, if everything on that work order, or, sorry, everything for that item, work orders on top, Sage orders on the bottom. January 24 to current I'd be a, I feel, I mean, if we could then go in and, yeah, because if there's if numbers aren't matching, we then we go into the work order and we okay, this was maps and clean up the quantities. And I mean, yeah, I mean, just boil it down.

Unknown Speaker  48:49
Edit, basically, go ahead, edit

Speaker 1  48:51
the quantity. Every once in a while, you know, like, guess, I just saw one this week where the order was 80, and they did whatever they came up short one. And I just, I just stuck one in there and clean up that. You know what I mean. Clean it up. Yeah, because they, when they wrote their sheets in two different days, they came up one short, but we invoiced for the full quantity and anyway,

Speaker 2  49:18
different ways. Yep, yeah. So I like it.

Speaker 1  49:25
I mean, I do too, like, yeah, should I? Should I go here in like, Wolf, what we have, like, we just do one. We're like, okay, stock is more than what they made. So we just assign that. Is that one still in here? Well, they're still unassigned work orders now, but okay, that was the NH, 7027, that was this guy right here, 70270, you see? What I'm seeing?

Matthias Miller  50:01
No, the screen shirt stopped. Not

Unknown Speaker  50:09
sure why. How do I get that back? Matt,

Unknown Speaker  50:18
sure Weiss,

Unknown Speaker  50:22
I'm not seeing, Oh, here,

Unknown Speaker  50:29
okay, shoot,

Speaker 1  50:33
get down there, all right, x that you got me, yep, okay, right here, 70270, yep, nine or 10 lines. What we're saying is all of these 827, all the way back to 623. Were assembled prior to June 26 June, 23, whatever.

Unknown Speaker  51:03
So then

Speaker 1  51:06
they all need attached to previous work orders.

Matthias Miller  51:11
Is it fair to say sorry? Say that we should not automatically attach stock items, but stock stock items probably need to be handled manually.

Unknown Speaker  51:20
Oh, I mean,

Speaker 2  51:24
the only, well, the the,

Speaker 1  51:31
whatever the in the armor would be, would be, how much is an inventory? So if we could add, like, you know, if right, that would be that. If, once we Yeah, if we were able to pull inventory out of the latest one and then then populate back, that'd be fine on stock items,

Matthias Miller  51:56
and then but, but first you need to make sure you're assembled, assembly quantities, right? That's

Speaker 1  52:00
not, yeah, that's not a match for match. But Matt, if you have, if everything comes across and sage orders come across, and now I'm going into those work orders like

Matthias Miller  52:14
nobody I'm saying is if he puts a quantity of of 70 in, because they did 70 mats and they skipped a day and then finish them a day later. And those don't get linked together. Do you care about that?

Speaker 1  52:33
Like it's two different work order entries and they're not. Yeah, it's, it's the same setup. But anyway, it comes in two entries and they're not to I mean, it's going to show up in the they're going to be back to back in the list, right? Like, in other words, when we look at this, when we go in here, look at work orders, they're going to be stacked on top of each other.

Matthias Miller  52:55
They'll be separate. I mean, if they're, if they're separated by a day for any reason, you

Speaker 1  53:03
right, yeah. But as long as it's populated by date, they're still going to be next to each other. When I look,

Matthias Miller  53:08
they will be next to each other. Yeah, I'm fine. But when, okay, but when we go to assign sales orders automatically for stock items, right, we treat them as two different items, which

Speaker 1  53:16
so then it won't, it won't automatically match up. Well, I don't

Matthias Miller  53:21
think we'll do any automatic matching on stock items out of the gate. Oh, okay, well, yeah. Well, that has to be, that has to be an inventory based, yeah, reverse assignment. Well,

Speaker 1  53:31
there's no match. I mean, there's no stock items that are like that, like there are like

Speaker 3  53:36
that. Okay, awesome, right? I'm pretty sure. Yep, good, good, good, good. Um,

Unknown Speaker  53:43
okay, what?

Speaker 1  53:46
Yeah, because, okay. So, for example, I'm gonna go back here to this 70270 and if I go into this work order, this was the last one. We just were here earlier, and we said that these 208, were are currently stock to stock item, whatever. Um, when you move everything across, Matt, and if you add all the sage orders from January of 2420 24 when I hit this drop down, I'm gonna have a whole slew here to pick from. Right?

Matthias Miller  54:25
Uh, only ones that haven't been tied out. I mean, if we automatically tie out sales orders, you only see the ones that haven't tied out correctly,

Speaker 1  54:34
right, right, right, right. But, like, say, but if you don't, okay, this is a stock item, but so if it's right, so if we're not telling our stock up, I'm gonna have all of those to pick from

Unknown Speaker  54:44
Correct.

Matthias Miller  54:48
Well, if, if we're trying to do a match within five business days for the right sales order, then, then, and then, no, like, you'll see half a dozen to a dozen or whatever the number is, but you're not going to see all of them. You.

Unknown Speaker  55:05
Know About on stock items, we're gonna have to have a bigger

Matthias Miller  55:07
range, right? The does on stock items, correct?

Speaker 1  55:13
Yeah, right here on my screen. Like, because, yeah, right. Because, if I go back here to this, oh, right here. Do this again. NH, 70270, this guy. This is the one where, like, here's an order for 651132, dotted, four. That's because 250, is a blanket order. But this is because we use them for shipping pallets. And every time we use this them for shipping, we invoice them for one or two or three. So there's gonna be a whole bunch of different sales orders. But when I go into this, the correct these are inventory. If I go to the previous one in the drop down, I'm gonna say, yep, six, yep, five, yep. Here's what we made, the one, the one, the three, the two, and we made some of the 250, blah, blah, blah. I'll just write simple enough,

Unknown Speaker  56:09
yeah, think

Unknown Speaker  56:10
so yeah, see, yeah. I think anyway, anything, it was anything else.

Matthias Miller  56:21
Let me don't think so. Let me get these in. I mean, I would suggest that let me get these in here. Try to do the automatic tie outs. And you can take a look. We can take a look however we want to do it, and probably be, I mean, yeah, with the weekend and stuff, I don't know if it's Wednesday or Thursday. Wednesday or Thursday or Friday of next week when it's going to be, but I can ping you when it's when, when

Speaker 1  56:47
we're there. Well, I think John's able to enter everything correctly now, as far as I know, you know, if there's no more, I think there's any. I mean,

Matthias Miller  56:58
yeah, we got to get the the quantity overrides and some stuff like that. But yeah,

Unknown Speaker  57:07
yeah,

Speaker 1  57:09
that thing from yesterday, what did you decide to do? Can you remind me what you decided to do?

Matthias Miller  57:14
So on the sales order, just allow to override,

Unknown Speaker  57:20
um, like,

Speaker 1  57:23
here's, here's the, here's a, here's an example they did, 1261, 552 this order, 552 this order, then, I mean, he has 157 here. He doesn't have a sign. He just did. This is

Unknown Speaker  57:48
this stock as well?

Speaker 1  57:50
No, this is those Armstrong ones where they'll I this is a this is a lady. This is a flag, actually, that just came up right here, right

Matthias Miller  58:03
what did he do? And Armstrong wasn't the one that we said we sometimes, that's the one where we sometimes send partial loads of other stuff.

Speaker 1  58:10
But I guess what happened here is, okay, this was yesterday, so that means they probably finished the load or whatever, this morning. So that's what happened. So is this now, there's a flag showing here why the flag would be because he doesn't have it assigned to anything else, right?

Unknown Speaker  58:40
He should have an order for the 157

Matthias Miller  58:44
I thought, what was the, what's the order? Where they, they always make it was something like this, 552 but then they don't ship them all always,

Speaker 1  58:51
well, it is these, but that's, that's an instance where Armstrong will ask for a couple odd sizes. And so instead of sending 552 we'll send less than 552 and we'll send a couple other sizes with that. And then they'll go in and they'll do their back order, delete blah, blah, blah scenario,

Matthias Miller  59:14
which is why I think we were saying, if we were, if we, if we would treat these as stock items, it should just work.

Speaker 1  59:23
Yeah, because now I'm

Unknown Speaker  59:28
he's got.

Speaker 1  59:32
I don't know why he had. I don't know why the 157 wasn't attached to an order.

Unknown Speaker  59:42
Or right, well,

Unknown Speaker  59:45
well, I guess I could look at this.

Unknown Speaker  59:48
I gotta you need to go. Yeah, I gotta go.

Unknown Speaker  59:52
375747372, he didn't even use the earliest. Number If, if the number sequence matters, here's two, 828,

Unknown Speaker  1:00:06
numbers, Ah,

Unknown Speaker  1:00:14
man, bro, I don't know.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:22
Oh, okay, all right,

Matthias Miller  1:00:31
I don't Yeah, it's probably a question to fill in some details on him, from him,

Speaker 2  1:00:35
yep, okay, thanks, Yep,

Unknown Speaker  1:00:39
thank you. How's Colorado?

Matthias Miller  1:00:40
Oh, I'm meeting with a friend up in monument. So I'm in Palmer lake right now. Good, meeting with a friend this afternoon, and in Palmer lake, or monument, we're going to be working on some AI tools that we're going to release next month.

Speaker 1  1:00:56
Nice. All right, cool. Well, we'll just connect when we're there, right? Yep, okay, yeah, see ya good.
