Unknown Speaker  00:55
Alright, how are you? Good?

Unknown Speaker  00:58
Yep. going well,

Unknown Speaker  01:02
is it going to join us today? Not today, next week or schedule opens up

Unknown Speaker  01:10
me,

Unknown Speaker  01:13
let me share my screen I guess

Unknown Speaker  01:18
let me make this bigger.

Unknown Speaker  01:22
Alright,

Unknown Speaker  01:26
client centric mission first,

Unknown Speaker  01:29
right?

Unknown Speaker  01:32
So we want to help visionary entrepreneurs who want to scale their seven figure company, we will help them by creating software solutions that will allow them to offload responsibility, provide accountability and training and offer insight into their business will also provide consulting around setting up systems in their business change the way to make a setting them start relying on software and systems to do the heavy lifting in their business. So that so that people can do their best work. And we will know we are successful when we have 100 businesses, our platform

Unknown Speaker  02:02
and

Unknown Speaker  02:06
that's it on

Unknown Speaker  02:11
me,

Unknown Speaker  02:14
I was going to be a little more prepared than I am.

Unknown Speaker  02:23
Are we on wins and commitments? No metrics first. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  02:28
okay.

Unknown Speaker  02:34
didn't quite get these filled in.

Unknown Speaker  02:43
Looks like you hit your target

Unknown Speaker  02:46
first.

Unknown Speaker  02:49
I don't even know what these are.

Unknown Speaker  02:51
Let's see, Oh, I didn't update these either.

Unknown Speaker  02:55
think these were these are like, weekly ones.

Unknown Speaker  02:59
And I didn't feel man

Unknown Speaker  03:01
seven. Let's do as if

Unknown Speaker  03:05
I did five and five.

Unknown Speaker  03:12
And

Unknown Speaker  03:16
I forgot again.

Unknown Speaker  03:27
So my, my goal is, I mean, I want to do the reboot is kind of a morning, and if you want to call it morning routine, or, or what.

Unknown Speaker  03:38
And then the

Unknown Speaker  03:41
daily planning is something that I've

Unknown Speaker  03:45
been trying to do for quite some time and have not been very consistent with it.

Unknown Speaker  03:51
And I thought maybe if I actually increase the visibility of whether I get that done, it would help me out. So that's the idea. Okay, and I forgot to fill in these. So

Unknown Speaker  04:06
oops,

Unknown Speaker  04:13
hold on.

Unknown Speaker  04:18
A second.

Unknown Speaker  04:21
can be 11th. I had

Unknown Speaker  04:25
Let's be I was 985. He's always confusing because it's two different weeks. A five to 11. It's

Unknown Speaker  04:50
and then 818 was

Unknown Speaker  05:02
brutal week last week for me.

Unknown Speaker  05:19
Why no graph

Unknown Speaker  05:23
on these two? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  05:28
I'm actually not sure.

Unknown Speaker  05:58
Progress.

Unknown Speaker  06:05
Come on.

Unknown Speaker  06:19
Guess the target value probably isn't no values. Right.

Unknown Speaker  06:25
Oh,

Unknown Speaker  06:27
metric start value

Unknown Speaker  06:31
target. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  06:37
I don't know. I should fix it. But

Unknown Speaker  06:44
not super motivated.

Unknown Speaker  06:51
So we're good on the leads. And

Unknown Speaker  06:57
actually,

Unknown Speaker  07:01
Oh, that's great. You got 21 leads

Unknown Speaker  07:06
this past week?

Unknown Speaker  07:09
Not this past week. That's total

Unknown Speaker  07:11
total. Okay. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  07:15
And that that target date was before December 31. IC? Yeah, it was

Unknown Speaker  07:24
funny.

Unknown Speaker  07:28
And so we've gotten so far.

Unknown Speaker  07:31
Oh, how many leads are? Yeah, we have.

Unknown Speaker  07:40
Let's see.

Unknown Speaker  07:44
Go into the pipeline. I'm just closing out one. There's the H rat guy said it's out of their budget for what they're wanting to do. This is almost certainly a no I should follow up with her again. This one's a maybe. I don't know, this is a yes. timelines. And certain This is probably I don't know what point I just dropped this out.

Unknown Speaker  08:08
And then I mean, this one's This is somewhat likely

Unknown Speaker  08:15
it's not going to be a big project, but it's going to be recurring revenue.

Unknown Speaker  08:19
This one's unlikely. But it's still worth hanging around

Unknown Speaker  08:24
this guy need to follow up with I was supposed to on Friday, and I was just swamped with faith builders. And I didn't.

Unknown Speaker  08:34
So

Unknown Speaker  08:35
there's two projects here that I have no idea what they are. I probably should have followed up sooner. But

Unknown Speaker  08:42
it is what it is.

Unknown Speaker  08:48
This is a recent one that's very interesting guy from just moved out from Lancaster get talking to him after after church last Thursday or something.

Unknown Speaker  09:00
So he's seems like a very sharp guy. And

Unknown Speaker  09:04
it'll be interesting to see where it goes. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  09:09
business that he sends out his dad, his dad. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  09:15
Talk about the Theory of Constraints there. Exactly. They're pegged, like, so. And, I mean, yeah, anyway, it's, it's really interesting. So I once again, the busiest person, I mean, wherever, wherever the most work is, there's your bottleneck, and I'm pretty sure it comes down to the owner.

Unknown Speaker  09:34
So it'll be interesting to see. Yeah, very good.

Unknown Speaker  09:40
So there's that

Unknown Speaker  09:43
I actually did some calculations. Um,

Unknown Speaker  09:49
again, in the interest of full transparency, here you go.

Unknown Speaker  10:11
So

Unknown Speaker  10:13
this is this is a fairly extensive dive into what I think we actually need to hit our goals that we want that I'm looking for, based on on personal income, business expenses, payroll, one of the biggest things is I really want to get to the point there's, I really want to want to be able to hire a good CPA,

Unknown Speaker  10:39
a good CPA could could save me, oh, it would cost about it's about four or five grand, but it would save me easily that much in taxes every year.

Unknown Speaker  10:51
And so it's, it's kind of one of those things that, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  10:56
it's not necessarily an urgent need. But when you look at the when you look at what that adds up to, yeah, it's, it's what we're doing. We've also consistently we've never consistently had a system in place regarding vacations.

Unknown Speaker  11:12
And so there's always we've always been subject to kind of the,

Unknown Speaker  11:16
we call it like the cycle like the up and down Evan flow cycle. And so being able to sets putting it putting together systems for setting money aside

Unknown Speaker  11:27
for that. And,

Unknown Speaker  11:33
and then, as well as I mean, another part of part of what we're looking to do to here we, we kind of got blindsided on taxes again, which we shouldn't. It's, it's fairly expected. But it's also not terribly uncommon for people to get blindsided. And so we want to be making we want to preempt.

Unknown Speaker  11:50
So this amount here includes the CPA but also includes preempting with, oh, yeah, we need to be making us to be the tax payments as well.

Unknown Speaker  12:00
And so when I put all of this stuff together, I really think my target hours should should be closer to 31 hours a week,

Unknown Speaker  12:08
which involves a fair degree of fair degree of focus for me

Unknown Speaker  12:14
now the areas of margin is that anytime you're working for Alice, not only does that cut cut payroll, but it also brings profit in Yeah, yeah. And so that creates leeway anytime I can I can land projects I mean, this is all based on software builders wages so which is which is a it's an adjusted calculation based on

Unknown Speaker  12:42
I mean, they have a multi tier developer ranking and then based on years of experience and then they add benefits on top of that and some sort of found a year for equipment or something like that and then he calculated contractor rate so that's how that gets calculated.

Unknown Speaker  13:00
So the more that I can build out to Ellis or ideally to the clients outside of that I mean, if we could if we could simply if we could simply start consistently building out my time at at say 150 an hour

Unknown Speaker  13:16
it would create significant margin in terms of time and in cash flow

Unknown Speaker  13:23
during my you're putting in there at eight is that based on it's based on softer builders, softer builders base me

Unknown Speaker  13:33
and so. And the other margin is I did this 31 based on four weeks per month. And so there's, it's actually four and a third weeks per month average in a year. And so that does include some margin for

Unknown Speaker  13:49
like that, I mean, technically, there's going to be like, two weeks extra or something like that in there that

Unknown Speaker  13:57
that are included. So it's basically

Unknown Speaker  14:00
before we versus 4.3 is a two hour difference between

Unknown Speaker  14:06
between a target for a week.

Unknown Speaker  14:11
So that's kind of how I got to that number at least gives me a very clear picture where I need to be

Unknown Speaker  14:19
really good like a break that down and so you're seeing what you're able to take home, then what's your investing in a business setting aside for vacation? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  14:37
all the taxes really out there? Yeah, they

Unknown Speaker  14:39
do. And I'm not very impressed with again, I mean, this is part of Part of the reason why you pay me finding a good CPA who, who doesn't bend the rules,

Unknown Speaker  14:52
because there's very clear evidence that the IRS is implementing artificial intelligence,

Unknown Speaker  14:58
it's going to be increasingly difficult for people to play the game.

Unknown Speaker  15:05
But for somebody who doesn't bend the rules, has integrity, but still is I mean, cutting, cutting, cutting as serpents and harmless as doves is really what you're looking for. You don't want them to take take, and you don't want them to take risks. But you do want them to be to be shrewd. Yeah, so yeah,

Unknown Speaker  15:23
I don't I think she was. Yeah, it's something like cutting it in half, or something like that. Half or a third or a half. Oh, yeah. So.

Unknown Speaker  15:40
So finding a CPA, is a matter of

Unknown Speaker  15:44
you connecting a selling you already know. Or cracking down on

Unknown Speaker  15:50
I mean, I have I have somebody I would if if I had the cash that I would be ready to go with. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  15:57
I mean, conceivably, if there were somebody I would trust within the Baptist community that I would say it's a no brainer, then, you know, maybe,

Unknown Speaker  16:07
I mean, I'd be open to that. But

Unknown Speaker  16:14
yeah, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  16:18
very good. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  16:23
So there's that.

Unknown Speaker  16:27
And the

Unknown Speaker  16:32
so that's metrics. And then there is,

Unknown Speaker  16:42
let's see,

Unknown Speaker  16:54
I probably want to put some stuff on these agendas.

Unknown Speaker  16:58
little side note me, this is like, this stuff is great. For

Unknown Speaker  17:07
me. It's great wages as as it I mean, if I were doing a 40 hour job working by myself, and buying my own equipment, that would be fantastic wages, I could not be more tickled with that.

Unknown Speaker  17:20
And I'm really grateful for it. But then when it comes to actually

Unknown Speaker  17:25
growing and scaling a business, it ends up maybe this is just like, anyway, yeah, it's interesting,

Unknown Speaker  17:33
interesting. World definitely takes a cut in your take home pay. Yeah, it's an investment here. You're making idea,

Unknown Speaker  17:43
right? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  17:44
that's the that's the idea. Yeah, I mean, it's that I've been, this

Unknown Speaker  17:51
is kind of silly. I mean, okay. So part of me is, like, kind of apologetic, I'm like, goodness, if I'd be a normal person, I could just work a 40 hour job. Look at how much money I mean, realistically, this is, this is a little crazy when you actually stop and think about it. But between, I'm not saying this is all used wisely, or is intentionally as I should have. But

Unknown Speaker  18:15
in in terms of my career, I could very easily probably, I've recently spent a quarter million and possibly even half a million in terms of opportunity cost in pay. And,

Unknown Speaker  18:30
and there's I mean, there's different reasons for that not I mean, some of it has been

Unknown Speaker  18:37
just because it's, it's been extremely difficult from, it's been a challenge for me, I suppose to find my way,

Unknown Speaker  18:44
there are a lot of kind of

Unknown Speaker  18:48
detours along along the way that made it really difficult.

Unknown Speaker  18:54
So when when you look at that, like, that's a when you actually frame it like that. That's a I don't know,

Unknown Speaker  19:04
you've been employed at the going rate all

Unknown Speaker  19:08
would have worked full time at the going rate all these years without investing money into other time and money into other ventures. So yeah,

Unknown Speaker  19:19
that's not really whatever, I'm just I don't know what, what I'm doing besides kind of baring my soul, it's not it's not really as a Sunday dinner conversation that I can have with my friends and be like, hey, look like

Unknown Speaker  19:36
it's just, it is what it is. I don't know what to

Unknown Speaker  19:41
take away your entrepreneurial spirit that would be then you could have done that. Yeah, yeah, exactly. And it's to do that, and No,

Unknown Speaker  19:50
we're not. And like, it's, it's this baffling thing we actually had,

Unknown Speaker  19:56
it's, it's kind of the thing that

Unknown Speaker  20:00
feels like a curse until you can actually harness it for a success, if that makes sense. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  20:06
and it's I mean, it's, it creates relational conflict, it creates disruption it, it makes it difficult to fit into existing systems it makes, I mean, yeah, I'm in the middle of some of some of those situations. Now, unfortunately, and

Unknown Speaker  20:22
you just gonna have to figure out how to work through them. Well, you have to learn to do it.

Unknown Speaker  20:27
So

Unknown Speaker  20:30
anyway, anyway,

Unknown Speaker  20:32
track what you would have earned in a 40 hour week job versus what you're doing now. And even if you come out earning less on this side than that side, I think you'll you'll be a lot more fulfilled and use your gifts. And I mean, I'm not I'm not saying you don't want to earn a lot of money. That's money. money's not bad in and of itself. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  20:59
What if you're being for Phil and using the guest, I gave you to the mat sets. That's that's worth a lot. And, and and there's not a lot of talk on the other side, about the health implications, because I honestly think that if, if I would have stayed if I would have continued to force myself into that mold. I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if I would have if I would have developed significant health issues for the time I was possibly mid 40s or 50s. Yeah, I'm like, your body is connected to the rest of your being. And you can't

Unknown Speaker  21:35
Yeah, so

Unknown Speaker  21:39
good

Unknown Speaker  21:42
stuff. Yeah. And I have, let's see here, let's get a commitment. A couple of things that I accomplished last week. Let me go through

Unknown Speaker  21:53
this.

Unknown Speaker  21:59
So these are actually really big deals,

Unknown Speaker  22:05
develop a system for meeting agendas.

Unknown Speaker  22:14
No, just a just the informal just a Google Drive thing.

Unknown Speaker  22:17
Oh, okay.

Unknown Speaker  22:22
Did the daily planner, I'm

Unknown Speaker  22:32
collecting the metrics like we talked about

Unknown Speaker  22:36
with

Unknown Speaker  22:43
our green, yellow and red or whatever you want to call it

Unknown Speaker  22:48
levels, wines, but

Unknown Speaker  22:54
let's see. Um,

Unknown Speaker  23:01
this is target target target hours, which is allowing more flex in my daily texts to come through with based on my target,

Unknown Speaker  23:23
he actually opted, he actually wanted to remove authorship from the book

Unknown Speaker  23:29
to avoid confusion with some other things that he's doing. Because it's really not genre that he's going to be going after. Yeah. Which makes sense.

Unknown Speaker  23:39
So there's that

Unknown Speaker  23:42
for me. This week, I'm gonna go for 26, I would love to hit hit 31. I honestly don't know if it's possible.

Unknown Speaker  24:03
And with that, I'm

Unknown Speaker  24:11
finalizing that lines are given. I'm

Unknown Speaker  24:15
trying to remember if there's anything else really that

Unknown Speaker  24:33
the other thing is, is actually there's one other thing I had

Unknown Speaker  24:42
is a big deal.

Unknown Speaker  24:45
So won't get to keep nearly all of the money.

Unknown Speaker  24:50
But $50,000 proposal for a

Unknown Speaker  24:55
design for design phase, which is far and away the biggest

Unknown Speaker  25:04
design phase that we've ever done for posting. So if it goes through, a lot of that actually is like six to eight K is probably well I posted gets 20%. So that's that's three grand, but they get

Unknown Speaker  25:20
for that supporting the ecosystem, 68 grand for the actual graphics work and whatever that leaves the rest,

Unknown Speaker  25:33
like for to

Unknown Speaker  25:38
four or five grand

Unknown Speaker  25:40
on by. And

Unknown Speaker  25:42
that's just the design phase. I would guess that the build out I don't really know, I'm guessing the build out somewhere around 60, but I don't really

Unknown Speaker  25:50
know for sure. Yeah, exactly. What I'm really optimistic for with this project is that we can we, I would love to get a Python developer in

Unknown Speaker  26:00
to the to help on some of these projects.

Unknown Speaker  26:05
And what I'm really hoping for is that the

Unknown Speaker  26:13
sorry, the,

Unknown Speaker  26:20
this project could actually help us help we could actually fund a recruiting fee to find somebody like that. And then we could have them as we keep them as a contractor, but just have them on standby for other kinds of projects. Yeah, that's, that's more on the front end development side of things. So yeah.

Unknown Speaker  26:41
Wow. Um, what's when you start that project?

Unknown Speaker  26:47
I mean, he's gonna be talking about it this weekend. And I mean, I, I, I don't really know I would love with if, well, we have the NHS project that we need to do. Yeah, there's some of this thing, I can actually start a lot of the design work and the even the front end and implementation on this project before any time is done.

Unknown Speaker  27:08
So it's, it's, I don't know,

Unknown Speaker  27:11
that's exciting. Yeah, it is, it is.

Unknown Speaker  27:17
And that came out of my contact here at your text art. And so that's Oh, that's can very easily help pay for

Unknown Speaker  27:28
rent and other things that

Unknown Speaker  27:31
other ways I've supported the project. So it's good to see that coming back

Unknown Speaker  27:39
and still on my list is,

Unknown Speaker  27:56
I don't know, we still have this whole thing of things I need to talk to you we needed during your talk through

Unknown Speaker  28:06
maybe if we have a few minutes. We could chat a little bit about your email. But why don't you Why don't you go ahead. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  28:12
so last week SPSS basically

Unknown Speaker  28:18
and soon my, my hours working on that, and yeah, I still it's taking longer than I expected. And

Unknown Speaker  28:28
I have a few,

Unknown Speaker  28:30
maybe another hour depends on

Unknown Speaker  28:34
what come to some of the stuff I ran into yesterday. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  28:38
I should be able to finish that up. And then Ellis.

Unknown Speaker  28:42
So that's what I did last week. This week. I'm looking to finish up that VSS

Unknown Speaker  28:51
quite sure what that looks like get to work with you are you need to Bartlett testing. Ellis city a little bit more there yet. So welcome. That my guess is no more than just a couple hours going over a few things. But

Unknown Speaker  29:09
seems like the testing. It's kind of hard to project exactly what time commitment will be. But I might get a better feel for that. Yeah. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  29:20
And I think I mean, I think I think I think it's, I mean, I think true, both is true, you'll get a better feel. But I think there's also wild card because

Unknown Speaker  29:31
you never know how will manage to make your life difficult.

Unknown Speaker  29:38
Funny thing is, it's there's something almost fulfilling about coming across

Unknown Speaker  29:44
and like, okay, what's going on here? And yes, I found something

Unknown Speaker  29:49
exactly

Unknown Speaker  29:50
the whole project and not find any bugs. It almost be like a lot. Like, why did I even do that? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  29:55
right. Okay. Yeah, that makes sense. I think it's it. It's good to have. I mean, I love having somebody who has a little bit of a

Unknown Speaker  30:06
take this right, but like an evil Glee that they get from like, Yeah, I got you guys like, Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  30:15
exactly. Exactly. It's awesome. Yeah. Like,

Unknown Speaker  30:20
other than that, I don't have a lofty goals for getting a lot then beyond that. But I'm hoping that I'll be able to get back to have a more research for local meetups for you

Unknown Speaker  30:36
big back through some of the emails that we've had back and forth. All action points.

Unknown Speaker  30:44
Sounds good. And actually, I mean, Heidi will have time next weekend. So if you want to turn over research to her, she does phenomenal at that kind of stuff. So that would be

Unknown Speaker  30:54
either you can do that. Or I can do that. I don't really, I don't always know, what's the most expedient way to do that. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  31:00
So just to get a better feel for her her time investment? How, like, how many hours on top of week by week activities that she has? Starting next? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  31:13
I think that she's been doing like, three or four, maybe five. So and I would expect her to have another about twice that per week. So it's, it's maxing out I think, at 10. And it might be a little less than that some weeks, but that's kind of

Unknown Speaker  31:34
ballpark but she's also very, at least in my experience is very quick with those kinds. Well, I say quick,

Unknown Speaker  31:46
it's just the perception. I mean,

Unknown Speaker  31:50
it's, it's enough in our sweet spot that I'm very comfortable just kind of throwing it over to her. And you know that I mean, she's focused on it and that kind of stuff. And it just all shows up incomes better? Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  32:02
Well, no, I'll take a look at that. And if, depending on how I'm feeling I might take that over her. Sure.

Unknown Speaker  32:13
I'll just tell you in today's email, Stacey,

Unknown Speaker  32:17
perfect.

Unknown Speaker  32:20
Yep. Sounds good.

Unknown Speaker  32:23
Sounds good.

Unknown Speaker  32:32
Alright. Any, any? Any? Anything more on the

Unknown Speaker  32:37
that's it for the list? Right? Yeah. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  32:49
What what you need what kind of support

Unknown Speaker  32:55
talented? That one question? Right? Well,

Unknown Speaker  32:58
I mean, I think I think the major I mean, I think the call on Friday is important to happen. I think the

Unknown Speaker  33:07
right now quite frankly, I mean, both SPSS and Bartlett are major things. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  33:22
I can't really think of much else. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  33:27
no, I,

Unknown Speaker  33:30
I would really like to get

Unknown Speaker  33:35
up and running.

Unknown Speaker  33:38
I

Unknown Speaker  33:39
I just need to set aside some time to dig down and finalize some of the setup stuff

Unknown Speaker  33:46
thing, get these numbers or whatever. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  33:51
I think the system is going to be a lot more reliable and easier to use on mobile apps. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  34:05
no, that'll be good. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  34:10
Well, I don't have much more to add to this discussion. Anyway.

Unknown Speaker  34:14
Okay. Sounds good.

Unknown Speaker  34:19
One of the questions I've kind of been bought and pondering that maybe you can answer separately some time is, if what's what's your superpower? What do you do better than most people around you do? And if you want a sample email, there's a great exercise where you email people who've known you for three years or more, preferably in a kind of work context. And you ask them that, that question,

Unknown Speaker  34:44
and you get some really interesting, interesting things.

Unknown Speaker  34:50
So

Unknown Speaker  34:52
I mean, it's a couple of observations I always work best live in in the moment. And I actually work best with urgency

Unknown Speaker  35:01
and so very open to, like, how do I do, how do I increase that for myself, there's some things that that I have done, I can do, it takes a fair degree of commitment on my end to to make that happen.

Unknown Speaker  35:17
I realized over the weekend, that planning is never in the moment. And I actually think that's part of the reason why it's I don't know,

Unknown Speaker  35:25
that may actually be

Unknown Speaker  35:28
one of the reasons why it's, it's more challenging, it's, it's easier the on some of these things, it would be easier for me to say, Well, go watch me do it, and then tell me how we can,

Unknown Speaker  35:40
we're all the pieces that I did to,

Unknown Speaker  35:45
to make it happen. The other kind of interesting thing was, it was thinking more along the lines of focus, then it was time. But if you have a

Unknown Speaker  35:54
I mean, there's a, I forget the exact physics formula. But if you have the, if you have a gas within a container, the gas pressure is is

Unknown Speaker  36:08
in inversely proportional to the, to the area of the surface or something along those lines. So in other words, as you narrow

Unknown Speaker  36:18
as you as you narrow the boundaries,

Unknown Speaker  36:24
and you change nothing else, then increases the force within that within that arena,

Unknown Speaker  36:35
which is much the same way of which was saying like, I mean, it's, it's actually some of the same things that you're saying here is that

Unknown Speaker  36:43
as that as that narrows as the deadline approaches, there's increased focus. Yeah. And so there's this thing I mean, it applies to focus it applies to,

Unknown Speaker  36:57
but I think it also it can apply to time

Unknown Speaker  37:01
limited, limiting the amount of time that you that you allow yourself to do something significantly increases the level of focus that you have on that.

Unknown Speaker  37:15
So I don't know if I'm still trying to go after too many things, especially in terms of marketing,

Unknown Speaker  37:21
or if, if

Unknown Speaker  37:30
I mean it, or maybe not actually going after too many things. We tried to keep too many options open or too many. I'm not I'm not exactly sure.

Unknown Speaker  37:40
It feels like I've kind of there's a million things that it could be doing.

Unknown Speaker  37:48
And I know I'm not doing any of them really well, right now. So

Unknown Speaker  37:55
not quite sure where to go with all that. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  38:01
Hmm.

Unknown Speaker  38:05
I like your illustration of narrowing the focus time in order to you exert pressure. And I think that's

Unknown Speaker  38:18
myself, but something that

Unknown Speaker  38:21
line

Unknown Speaker  38:23
that I've already seen with in my life. Is that my activities expand a bit. Yeah, I can somehow find a way to own in the time runs up. Okay, I'll move on to the next thing instead of allowing the clock ticking, Jeff. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  38:42
But

Unknown Speaker  38:45
going

Unknown Speaker  38:47
back to what you were saying about where to focus? What are you focusing on too much? I don't know. I guess I don't have a lot of commentary on that. Other than I think we have narrowed it down to you. Yeah, yes. That's a matter of developing. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  39:09
And I think maybe part of the frustration, I think this happens a lot is that

Unknown Speaker  39:17
some of the, like, some of the things like research when I don't see immediate, like, I mean, we're sold out, I mean, we're sold out, like, like, you're working on testing, which is important stuff to be doing. But then this ends up like the, the research side of it ends up you know, facing out a little bit,

Unknown Speaker  39:34
don't really have time to focus on Anna Baptist tech leads or contacts,

Unknown Speaker  39:39
those kinds of things. And that's where I think it's easy for me to kind of react and say, well, nothing's happening, when in reality, something is happening. It's just

Unknown Speaker  39:53
so would it be? I'm just thinking out loud here. Would it be better for NYS, if we

Unknown Speaker  40:01
say testing, and never take more than two thirds of your time each day, or talking about myself,

Unknown Speaker  40:10
never use more than two thirds amount of your hours on testing. The downside for that is if we get in a time crunch, then either a great rules, or we get our deadline. Yeah, prioritize long term

Unknown Speaker  40:29
activities as well. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  40:32
and there's actually a practice. And again, I haven't been very faithful in this. And personally, because I haven't always been sure what to work on. But

Unknown Speaker  40:39
a practice that I have adopted that we sent periodically, which is spend 60 minutes hyper focus, set a timer, get your water, everything, so you don't have to get up, get everything ready and spend 60 minutes working on the most important thing that you could possibly be working on right now.

Unknown Speaker  40:55
So it might be writing an email about might be working on it might be writing in, right, like a marketing email, or it could be a post or it could be finishing up a client project or

Unknown Speaker  41:08
any number of those things. But it's a way of saying, look, I this is absolutely important. And I'm not going to let the urgent

Unknown Speaker  41:16
overtake that

Unknown Speaker  41:19
Now, given given, I guess two thirds

Unknown Speaker  41:22
is still kind of goes back to my biggest concern is that

Unknown Speaker  41:26
that in those times, when there's testing jobs come that you end up having enough time in the day to make it kind of feels to me like spending three hours a day, like you don't really want to cut that much shorter to actually do testing.

Unknown Speaker  41:46
It takes time to get given. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  41:49
by the time I mean, to get set up getting the crew find your place.

Unknown Speaker  41:58
I actually think I mean, I actually think in this specific situation, maybe the best thing is to hand off,

Unknown Speaker  42:05
okay, once SPSS is done, like,

Unknown Speaker  42:10
what would it actually need to start sitting up and about to start tech calls

Unknown Speaker  42:17
it a system? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  42:23
and I think I mean, I think it's actually quite

Unknown Speaker  42:27
again, now that we know that we started talking about it,

Unknown Speaker  42:31
I have this,

Unknown Speaker  42:35
I've been thinking about this for the last couple weeks, again,

Unknown Speaker  42:41
this whole concept of

Unknown Speaker  42:47
connection,

Unknown Speaker  42:49
like touch points, basically. And,

Unknown Speaker  43:01
and so I mean, we could track we could, you know, at a minimum when when this happened, we could, we could have first put them in here track and I could track when when actually talk to them as summarize a conversation with them briefly, that going into a ton of detail. And that would at least give us kind of a CRM, where we can

Unknown Speaker  43:23
keep track of those kinds of things,

Unknown Speaker  43:28
then we can keep enhancing and improving that as time goes on.

Unknown Speaker  43:38
Right. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  43:44
over his or her actual birth pains. Yeah, okay. Yeah, actually,

Unknown Speaker  43:50
I mean, there's a field for it.

Unknown Speaker  43:55
I actually have a report that shows me

Unknown Speaker  44:04
I mean, like, Great example, on Thursday, I should text Jeremy, I'm just wishing me a happy birthday,

Unknown Speaker  44:17
then I don't really have a good accountability system around birthdays either. So what does that take that take a daily text saying, Okay, today, actually, that wouldn't be a bad idea,

Unknown Speaker  44:30
either send these texts,

Unknown Speaker  44:35
mail this card

Unknown Speaker  44:38
up to send them a card,

Unknown Speaker  44:42
because I've done that for for some people as well.

Unknown Speaker  44:49
Can you hang on a second,

Unknown Speaker  49:25
we

Unknown Speaker  49:27
have I have, I talk to you at all about

Unknown Speaker  49:32
our adoption, any any of our adoption stuff.

Unknown Speaker  49:40
So we have we adopted a four year old boy. And while you were seeing his picture Dante in December, and we've been working with the state of Florida, his sisters in Florida, in in foster care down there. And it's been a kind of a long, crazy story. But we need to just kind of got this function to rent like, just randomly

Unknown Speaker  50:03
see where she's at, and see if, you know, see where cases going. And

Unknown Speaker  50:08
at first, we found out that it seemed like she was in a good home, and

Unknown Speaker  50:13
etc. And so we were true our application to adopt. And then the agency actually came back to us and asked us if we would if we would consider reapplying

Unknown Speaker  50:22
because the person her caregiver isn't eligible to adopt.

Unknown Speaker  50:27
And so we did, and we all this stuff is like, there's like it moves in stages. And so there's increasing level whatever, just nothing is final until its final. But

Unknown Speaker  50:42
the review committee, the review board was did interviews with with us and the contesting family and we just got a call back that we were selected as the adoptive family. So yeah, so now we start the all the legal process and transferring custody and interstate placement and all that other kind of stuff. But

Unknown Speaker  51:07
after I spend, I don't know how long it's been. It's been a long time since we first started. I don't know if it's, it's been over six months. It's actually probably been longer than that,

Unknown Speaker  51:18
to get to this point. And it's just very slowly. But that's good news. So we're excited.

Unknown Speaker  51:27
He is he is for and his sister is too. So.

Unknown Speaker  51:33
And then we have another like another little girl who will be turning to we have a court case related to her on Thursday this week, where they'll

Unknown Speaker  51:46
they'll be recommending us as adoptive parents for her as well.

Unknown Speaker  51:51
And so she'll be

Unknown Speaker  51:54
Yeah, yeah. And so that's, and she'll be, she'll be two in October. So, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  52:03
so no, we got no idea what we're getting ourselves into. But

Unknown Speaker  52:11
so we have we have 200 home right now. Okay. And then it would be three with with Nevada.

Unknown Speaker  52:18
Okay. So yeah, so

Unknown Speaker  52:21
I mean, the Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  52:24
the so we have one yet one. One adopted once one still in foster care. Working on adoption. Yeah. And then the other one,

Unknown Speaker  52:34
you guys have your phone? Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  52:44
So every, every once in a while, we got the little girl that we have. We got a call. Literally, it was it was literally, I think, three hours between the time we got the call from DHS. And when we picked her up from the hospital.

Unknown Speaker  53:00
Everyone smile when I hear people talking about surprise babies. I I just kind of laugh because I think this is

Unknown Speaker  53:07
it's just

Unknown Speaker  53:09
Yeah, exactly. tried three hours.

Unknown Speaker  53:14
I mean, it's a Yeah. Anyway, that dumpling that it just it is cracks me up sometimes. So your life is sometimes a little crazy. But that's good. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  53:24
So we most likely will be spending I we don't know how long maybe a week in like, in about two weeks ago, be heading down to Florida with her. So see how that goes. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  53:40
And that would be a great reason to up the ante on my hourly, weekly, weekly time commitments.

Unknown Speaker  53:49
Talk about urgency. That's a great, great way to leverage that as well.

Unknown Speaker  53:57
So good. I think I think in terms of what it has to do, I think I think we can actually spell it out fairly well, fairly simply.

Unknown Speaker  54:05
And we'll we'll kind of

Unknown Speaker  54:11
I don't know, what we need to do is set that in motion.

Unknown Speaker  54:15
But again, I guess the main thing I care about our Friday meetings is that we come out with clear action steps assigned to specific people with specific deadlines that we

Unknown Speaker  54:25
that we can that we can follow through on. And as long as we have that, then we don't mind them.

Unknown Speaker  54:36
I don't mind doing it like that. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  54:40
sounds good. And I I didn't get much of a chance on email. You sent me a job description?

Unknown Speaker  54:49
No, no worries. That's like, that's important, but not urgent. So yeah.

Unknown Speaker  54:54
And I think the other thing we want to do Fridays is, is to go over the fence. And I think as much as you can, moving that stuff into, into into the incidence

Unknown Speaker  55:07
will will help with prioritization. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  55:12
even little tasks like that. I mean, if it's,

Unknown Speaker  55:16
if it's a five minute task, you should just, you should just go do it. When you check your email. Yeah, but if it's, if it's 30 minutes, or, or something, then

Unknown Speaker  55:28
I guess what, I don't know, I see this,

Unknown Speaker  55:37
if you have, if you have half a dozen of those, which is a day a week, or maybe this is just

Unknown Speaker  55:42
me, you just need to say, like, like, Look, like, realistically, I need to spend the day catching up, and all these little things. And then we could do that. And that's fine. I'm not saying I don't want to create busy work. That's, that's the last thing I want. The thing I'm really after is transparency in your workload. Because when I send an email, I think, forget about it. And so I don't, I don't want to have this expectation that you should be getting more done when we're still this backlog of stuff that I asked you to do. So yeah,

Unknown Speaker  56:10
now it makes sense to keep that keep that track.

Unknown Speaker  56:22
Good job description is a is a little hard for, like,

Unknown Speaker  56:27
even now. And people asked me, so what do you what do you do like a national park? I'm like, Well, I don't even know what my title is. But

Unknown Speaker  56:40
I mean, I think your job is, is really customer support. That's, that's what I would say. I mean, testing. One of the reasons why we're putting you on testing as well, because we break things and you need to find it. But then also, because we want you to know the systems. Yeah, and all these other odds and ends that that you

Unknown Speaker  57:05
what you end up doing. I mean,

Unknown Speaker  57:09
I don't know, admin assistant, could be an appropriate term as well. But that's not really I mean, that's like, secondary to what you

Unknown Speaker  57:15
what we're actually after. I like that,

Unknown Speaker  57:20
that really helps me

Unknown Speaker  57:25
like, I knew that was a part of it. But that definitely helps me understand focus a little more

Unknown Speaker  57:30
awesome support. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  57:34
that we've not had a lot of customer support yet. It doesn't feel like that doesn't feel

Unknown Speaker  57:39
like that's what you're doing.

Unknown Speaker  57:41
Exactly.

Unknown Speaker  57:43
And as a side note, once, once you get through testing, then I let you go sit, you can actually get on that.

Unknown Speaker  57:51
But then I want to get get you in a call with Vivian where we go through the system so that you have that

Unknown Speaker  57:57
yeah, that contact as well.

Unknown Speaker  58:09
Good, good.

Unknown Speaker  58:10
Good.

Unknown Speaker  58:12
Okay. Very good. So when are you just understand what our goal is for this week? Are you planning to planning to wrap up?

Unknown Speaker  58:23
Yes, yes. I mean, literally, as soon as you can,

Unknown Speaker  58:27
as soon as you feel comfortable with what you have left. And I don't even mind if there's some small, non essential things. What I'm really concerned about at this point is there's some major glaring issue or the two things something doesn't just overtly does not work. And there's some kind of calculation error. That's what I'm worried about. Yeah, and the rest of this stuff, and because that's the things that that breaks, trust the most what I mean, yeah, and other little things that are less or more marginal, those are fine. Where we we pushed back to later in the week,

Unknown Speaker  59:04
I would be absolutely tickled if, if we could get it wrapped up today, but I don't even know if that's possible.

Unknown Speaker  59:08
Okay. If you see the email, I said, Yes. Yes. I

Unknown Speaker  59:13
tried to respond. I didn't update this, I should make sure that the update actually worked. I I'm 99% sure that it did an update

Unknown Speaker  59:21
the issues? Yes,

Unknown Speaker  59:22
there were, there were a number of issues and then some, you were just the issues kind of can compound it and confused you. So

Unknown Speaker  59:32
without really knowing what was going on it it I mean, it makes sense. Why

Unknown Speaker  59:39
why it would have been confusing. Okay. So no, you weren't just going crazy. And I think in a typical day, I would have a 21 No, let's see. I really want this I think in a typical day would have asked you to interrupt me and and

Unknown Speaker  59:59
that's real sooner. But

Unknown Speaker  1:00:03
let me do this. I just want to make sure I'm I'm like no, I did that in the morning. didn't die.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:10
Now, there was

Unknown Speaker  1:00:15
three that did not update. I was having trouble up doing it last night.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:56
Sure. What.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:30
Let me just double check. Make sure

Unknown Speaker  1:04:37
also sent me an email saying after the Apollo about falling up a friggin Jonathan

Unknown Speaker  1:04:46
Yes. Um,

Unknown Speaker  1:04:51
and then I realized

Unknown Speaker  1:04:53
I could probably just

Unknown Speaker  1:04:57
Well, here's basically what I want you to, let's see.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:23
Not even sure if

Unknown Speaker  1:05:36
I'll send you an email with details on it. It's easiest way

Unknown Speaker  1:05:43
good. Anything else?

Unknown Speaker  1:05:46
And that's you, as well as an ongoing system for follow up.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:53
Yes. And so basically, what I'm looking for is when people

Unknown Speaker  1:06:01
when people request the booklet, that there'd be some kind of way I can let you know what happened. And then you can that is his email,

Unknown Speaker  1:06:12
you can follow up with them.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:15
So here's the basic email.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:48
I guess there's the question without posting. Should we be I mean, do we want to keep track of people who've gotten it for follow up? I mean, it's, it's a way of them raising their hands. Jonathan, for example, I mean, we're doing a project them. So, you know, whoopee, whoopee.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:05
Craig

Unknown Speaker  1:08:08
has always been interested in my stuff, you know, has paid me pay me some to do stuff over the years

Unknown Speaker  1:08:16
now, not not necessarily software, but marketing these kinds of things.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:35
What should we do with the responses

Unknown Speaker  1:08:50
to start out

Unknown Speaker  1:08:53
as a profile? And then

Unknown Speaker  1:09:00
book that sent out? Follow up set a reminder to follow a month later send this email? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:09:10
month is really too long. I would say one to two weeks

Unknown Speaker  1:09:14
after they get it.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:16
Maybe maybe two weeks.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:57
So Jonathan would have gotten his

Unknown Speaker  1:10:26
this one. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:41
Is that good enough that you can put together

Unknown Speaker  1:10:49
Okay, thanks. I just there you go. There's my live in an action. I can't think of what I actually want you to do, until we actually

Unknown Speaker  1:10:58
go do it. So that's what my you're listening to.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:03
Right?

Unknown Speaker  1:11:06
How's it

Unknown Speaker  1:11:07
are Fridays are Fridays are sort of hoping you'd be able to do that. But

Unknown Speaker  1:11:13
what should we?

Unknown Speaker  1:11:16
What if, what if it becomes more of a work oriented thing? Like, we're gonna pick off one piece, and we're gonna go do this piece

Unknown Speaker  1:11:26
you're saying, like, centered around a project or?

Unknown Speaker  1:11:32
Well, no, I mean, okay, when it comes to, okay, my, my magic comes in injecting energy into an existing situation and starting things that's basically and coming up with ideas and understand tying it into what we actually want to achieve. And there's some other things. So some of the nuances like I mean, marketing, and I mean, there's, there's other things like that, that I bring to the table as well. But when you really boil it down to my Mo, that's, that's what it is that I provide.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:07
The challenge is not lack of ideas, the challenge is prioritization. And then the challenge is,

Unknown Speaker  1:12:15
is also

Unknown Speaker  1:12:19
putting those things into a process, I suppose that somebody else can take over. Yeah, like, honestly, with some of these, like LinkedIn connections, I think, if I were, if one of our things for Monday would be

Unknown Speaker  1:12:33
would be like, go message about three people, how you would message them to start an outreach to them, and we would go do that. And I would write about, I would look at three profiles and pick them out and and write something for them, then that would be something that we could kind of say, Okay, well, here's, as a matter of principle, like,

Unknown Speaker  1:12:55
I mean, pick random random person, Cody Miller is now a connection sales executive at a link insurance

Unknown Speaker  1:13:05
like or insurance. Oh, I mean, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:13:10
question number one, do I do I want to develop, cultivate a relationship with him? I mean, he's, he

Unknown Speaker  1:13:19
doesn't really know that many people

Unknown Speaker  1:13:22
on LinkedIn, at least

Unknown Speaker  1:13:32
I mean, lighting professional, that could be possibly be interesting. So how do I choose which people I really want to cultivate a relationship with?

Unknown Speaker  1:13:51
And then how do I start cultivating that that relationship?

Unknown Speaker  1:14:11
Let's go for it. But I think there's room to figure it out. Yeah, I like that.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:14
I like interactive

Unknown Speaker  1:14:20
where you're walking through how you do it

Unknown Speaker  1:14:25
on a dock that you can see right there. Yeah, you finalize it, I put it over the wiki and we

Unknown Speaker  1:14:31
have a working procedure right there. Exactly. That's nailed it. That's how I work. That's how I function.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:39
Good.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:40
Okay, so Yeah, sounds good. Maybe I'm too. Here's just a random idea that I thought of, maybe on Tuesdays, we can decide you can think ahead. What would be a good

Unknown Speaker  1:14:52
piece work on on that Friday and allows you to be thinking about that,

Unknown Speaker  1:15:00
nail it documented, file it away and then talk about how do we take that piece and implement

Unknown Speaker  1:15:13
sounds good.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:19
Awesome.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:21
Well, testing then.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:23
Alright, sounds good. Good luck goes.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:26
Yep. Sounds good. All right. Yep.
