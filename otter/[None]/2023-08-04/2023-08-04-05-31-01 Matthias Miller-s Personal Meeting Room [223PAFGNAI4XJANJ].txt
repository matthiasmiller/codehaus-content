Unknown Speaker  00:41
Is it cold? Yeah. I mean, I don't

Matthias Miller  00:46
know. 60 degrees in this house 68

Unknown Speaker  00:49
I'm sorry. Lucky you sorry, I should

Unknown Speaker  00:56
probably tilt my screen here

Speaker 1  00:58
a little bit. Was this like 530 in the morning for you the world? I know right. Now I know what I'm thinking. I mean, either. What are we talking about today? Counting stuff. Is Mark jumping on Mark's trip and I'm supposed to be a lovely one then more than doing what timezone Do you Do you reside in Easter I'm in reverse located Northern Virginia,

Speaker 2  01:33
Northern Virginia where what precisely

Speaker 1  01:37
I'm the closest town that most people understand or know would be monastic. Okay. So like 15 minutes south of their little town called Catlett but

Unknown Speaker  01:52
yeah

Speaker 2  02:00
where is exactly that? Oh, look at that. Oh, you're just Oh, I see Catlett Oh, so you are in close proximity to a real cesspool over

Unknown Speaker  02:08
there. Yeah. Yesterday

Speaker 2  02:13
with as you're gonna appreciate this one yesterday, not yesterday day before I was talking to Gabe and he made a joke that I just about fell over laughing on. He said Do you know why there's no nativity scenes in Washington ever each year for Christmas?

Unknown Speaker  02:25
Because it's impossible to find three

Unknown Speaker  02:29
wisemen

Unknown Speaker  02:33
where does he come up with these

Unknown Speaker  02:34
Yeah, such a dead joke

Speaker 1  02:46
Catlett Catlett Virginia In fact, I don't know how precise you're Googling but there's the business called Golden Rule builders right in the center of Catlett where I'm currently sitting you really want to get get get like Golden Rule builders yep Wow, that's Wow, they're their pictures are cool.

Unknown Speaker  03:19
Can I have that house? Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  03:23
They do good work. Looks that way. I might be a little biased because my dad works for him and the owner goes to my church but you know, it's a good work yeah. Do Nice work. Golden Rule builders.

Speaker 1  03:53
Mark, Morning, guys. Morning. Morning, order.

Unknown Speaker  04:09
Ready?

Unknown Speaker  04:16
Mark,

Matthias Miller  04:17
quick question for you follow up on my email yesterday. Does RTF work for you? Or do you need it some three something different for it to actually work for you? It

Speaker 3  04:34
kind of works the like the formatting is messed up. Like the bullet points. The numbering is different. I think I get numbers for their work points or it just makes it confusing. Do you have any other formats that you can you can use? Like other word formats

Matthias Miller  04:58
remember if we You were to kind of whichever

Unknown Speaker  05:21
so I'm just look like Microsoft Word

Matthias Miller  05:36
I can just write well, the only other option I have is sending as a plain text file.

Speaker 3  05:45
With that, do you think there's any chance that well, we could, we could try. And if you have a way to send me a copy or sent me now that I can just take it

Matthias Miller  05:57
and I can, easiest way is to change it to send you both kinds. And then just kick it off real just now

Matthias Miller  06:23
All right. As I recall, it takes a few minutes for it to queue up and send but

Unknown Speaker  06:33
we can take a look at it while we're as.

Matthias Miller  06:51
And I see okay, let me Yeah, the other thing would be well, yeah, what do you what do you have in your on your agenda?

Speaker 3  07:05
I did not get anything done on or flowcharts. But I, well, I have I'm looking at the email you send about vendor invoices for payroll and then the Cash Flow Report. So it know your invoices for payroll something that some are known and then go into cash flow. Outline Joel had said,

Matthias Miller  07:34
well, for strictly doing by prayer already, I think cash flow comes first.

Speaker 3  07:47
And maybe maybe we should just do you have an hour you blocked out? Any minutes until nine for this? Yeah.

Speaker 3  08:05
Get done quickly with a cash flow. Maybe we'd be better off to just one thing we could do would be drop off and

Unknown Speaker  08:22
it's an I spent 30 minutes or so putting up Nereus together and then the group again it say 30. But yes, I think going by already those are that's probably I know we need to get the cash flow thing done by the 10 deadline but then

Matthias Miller  08:49
somewhat relaxed with AP stuff Josh's taking that I think the only thing we need to consider is source account from

Matthias Miller  09:02
between Josh's working on AP and outbound Ach, and between those he's got played, making busy keeping busy. He's not too worried about drastic changes that will require him to redo AP stuff. And so

Matthias Miller  09:21
if it's all the same, I would after doing well, I don't see if you're going to have time. I guess you're out of the office on Monday. But even if we get the flowchart the other day people try to steal stuff by middle or end of next week. I don't foresee that being any issue in our end.

Speaker 3  09:44
Okay, so what what Josh is doing is more core pieces to that. And then the flowcharts you're looking at that as more of just in this situation here the steps that happened in this situation here the steps that need to happen. Which is doesn't necessarily affect the work that Josh is doing right now. Is that what I'm hearing?

Matthias Miller  10:15
Yes, correct.

Speaker 3  10:16
Okay. Perfect. That makes sense. Well, then. So should we do cash flow for that? So I'm just looking at what Joel had sent out, and just made a few notes there. So I thought, probably the easy thing is just read through this talk through this. And obviously, that was a lot of a list of questions, I'm sure for Joel, possibly some homework for us.

Speaker 3  10:57
I don't know. But as you've probably shared this with Ben and Dwayne, they have a copy of, of what we're looking at. I'm

Matthias Miller  11:07
sharing my screen, but I send it over to them as well. So they got it.

Speaker 3  11:24
So how do you want to go through this Matthias, do you want to bleed through? Or do you want me to do that? And where I have questions, and then we

Matthias Miller  11:38
I'll be honest, I'll focus better if I kind of summarized as we go through and you jump in with your questions. Okay. So outcome responses looking for is basically does this is basically look right, read headed in the right direction. There's simple errors or holes in this. And question about the sorts of year end closing transactions, which, that

Speaker 3  12:11
that's where I have my first set of questions, and maybe you can explain, like your end of accounting entries, you're expecting to make it year end and create closings? So I don't know. Is that clear to you, then than it is to me? I mean, it's, I think what he's saying is, is well, we okay, we we only close at year end for for our companies. I mean, obviously, you could do it, and I don't see that changing? Am I correct that what he's seeing is closing period is typically when all of your all that? Well, yeah, all of your temporary accounts. All the numbers that are in there are dump all of that those numbers out and start with zero again, January 1, or a better example would be like the income statement, the numbers on on your income statement, your expenses and income they needed to grow and grow and grow throughout the year, you come to year end, then you take all of that the result of all of that all your net income, take the net income and then apply that to owner's equity. That you have income of 750,000, then December 31, or when you close that period, you would take that down on 50,000. And if you only have one owner, obviously you that owner's equity would increase by 750,000. And your net income would your all of your income, all of your accounts on your on your income statement would revert to zero which would effectively make your income start at zero. Is that is that that's basically my thing, thinking about a closing period correctly?

Matthias Miller  14:35
Yes, that's my understanding. The only Yeah, and I think all the tools asking for is is that exactly what it is? Is there anything else that that might be involved? That's you know, what would it be? Exactly, I mean, yeah, is that literally the transaction? Or is there anything else that's involved?

Speaker 3  15:05
Well, one, okay. Another thing that that is that will be involved is the way that we're planning to handle finished goods inventory. So because we're, we're building stock items we post all of those bills, labor and overhead expenses to an asset account on the balance sheet. You have finished goods and then underneath finished, we have on the balance sheet we have assets finished goods. And inside of finished goods, we have things like production overhead, and then inside that we have break from supplies or supplies and equipment, all of those smaller categories, those those out categories will start at zero January 1, and they'll grow and grow and grow throughout the year. And the way we'll all set those is with that contra account that every time a building every time a building is built is going to use the bathroom supplies example every every time we break room supplies throughout the year, that number continues to grow from 100 to 200 to 300 400 and then every time you build a building you don't move 10 cents that breakrooms applies there to a completed building, but we're not net we're not going to go to the break room supplies and always interested when we receive off and always decrease it whenever a building is built. You have a contra account at the bottom that offsets that so that then at the end of the year that would those would both need to go to zero. So I think that's something that oh, it needs to know. I don't know if I think maybe one of the best ways to explain that is the little

Unknown Speaker  17:28
binder. Now the little spreadsheet example that I put together that way early on when we were looking at the finished goods inventory and unless you have a better way of better way of explaining that Messiah's.

Matthias Miller  17:50
Oh, got it would you have that handy and could you just take that and add a final transaction at the end for the for the urine closing transaction that you anticipate

Speaker 3  18:05
Yeah, and well I think I already have that let me see real quick I will this and that that that would I think that's something that would be important for him to know now at the.

Speaker 3  19:28
Well, I sense that let you know that Josh taken update live last night then that would have been for it would have taken the new payroll verification report live.

Matthias Miller  19:46
Yep. And I think I have untested employee verification with the time off me thanks. Will those

Speaker 3  20:02
will those okay now that those verification reports are live so we've, we've tested the last two weeks using the old verification reports if we ask Dwayne's office to send us to resend us those verification reports, you know for the week of last week what are we going to get? Are we going to get that that same data in in the new verification reports Yeah. Okay, perfect. So is there any I mean we've we've that's the case and I think the best thing is just request those and then compare Yeah, because we're we're asking for posing some some different databases right

Unknown Speaker  21:12
like there may be some

Matthias Miller  21:13
issue with conditional visibility anyway. If you sidenote if you can

Matthias Miller  21:31
while we're derailed anyway, what company did you enter payroll for and what week did you enter for

Speaker 3  21:40
Well, we've entered for the last entered at least three weeks worth of the week of lie nine in 23rd and 30th.

Speaker 3  22:02
It for the 16th 23rd and 30th for six companies ABC wanting to very stone structures dead time vinyl structures and white tail run.

Matthias Miller  22:48
Is one change every guy we need to make which

Unknown Speaker  22:54
is

Unknown Speaker  22:59
ours

Unknown Speaker  23:11
No.

Matthias Miller  23:39
We fix these doing we change this expression here in the company record to be hours remaining to total hours

Matthias Miller  23:57
calculate the custom calculation of vacation days. You're muted.

Matthias Miller  24:08
During your you're muted.

Speaker 2  24:11
How about I click on Yeah, I see that. I was talking to nothing apparently. Is that where we had notifications on on it? Yeah, that.

Unknown Speaker  24:23
Yes. This one? Is it fixed which

Unknown Speaker  24:25
is so it needs to be updated? It's fixed now. It's fixed. I

Matthias Miller  24:29
fix it just now. Okay, perfect. This is this is your new expression. Okay.

Matthias Miller  24:39
So actually, that might actually take care of this other issue. Let me let me open this one up again one more time. Let's actually do this and see if we can just

Unknown Speaker  24:56
be willing

Matthias Miller  25:03
Find back every word

Unknown Speaker  25:30
yeah looking

Matthias Miller  25:33
what's the right looks like there's a little bit of a spacing issue on these but yeah looks like it's saying at least

Unknown Speaker  25:44
I'm

Matthias Miller  25:49
good So closing transactions

Speaker 3  25:55
on on the verification reports yet is that so we're good to test I mean our from what you can see there they would be ready for us to get a new set in look at those review those

Matthias Miller  26:10
yeah thanks so

Speaker 3  26:13
perfect when should we just reach out to Shannon and ask for that hurry sent those

Unknown Speaker  26:25
yeah I would think so yeah

Unknown Speaker  26:32
that's all I had on that

Matthias Miller  26:37
good alright so closing transaction you were gonna hunt down that spreadsheet we're gonna do to set it save the files instead I

Speaker 3  26:45
send it no I just send it as a PDF directly to your you should you should have it now

Unknown Speaker  27:20
alright so we have the

Matthias Miller  27:29
sorry I'm gonna have to drop off for one minute.

Unknown Speaker  28:46
Okay so

Matthias Miller  28:51
you're in reconciliation

Unknown Speaker  28:56
the so this would show

Matthias Miller  29:04
obviously cash stays the same on the urine reconcile. Right? This is the urine reconciliation, you're basically zeroing out the sub accounts

Speaker 3  29:18
which is different. It's somewhat different because we're zeroing them out on the balance sheet. I mean, the only only thing I mean, I'm happy to walk through ports all jumbled together well drilled through this if if that were helpful but the last two sets the march 31 and December 31st. Or maybe only to that yeah, that that and I did not the income statement obviously is not closed out. Like you would a year end like worse. still showing net income of 3916 and we still have you know, we're still showing revenue hogs but the thing to notice is that on the assets the finished goods production overhead the breakroom supplies well those those four accounts have been zeroed out it's all moved up to

Unknown Speaker  30:28
an account finished goods production overhead

Unknown Speaker  30:41
you've got

Speaker 1  30:48
48 Okay, you have 48 You've you have a net

Matthias Miller  31:00
of $8 the protection so

Unknown Speaker  31:05
what's going where?

Speaker 3  31:09
So, what we're showing assuming you're looking at the number 31st A note there at the bottom to your end reconciliation. Yeah, sure which that okay, that's basically the that's exactly what we're doing with the FGI allocation process we're saying be we thought it was going to be $40 Oh we have negative 40 on March 31 that we move to production overhead to inventory but we we actually incurred expenses of 48 your 2510 and 13 adds up to $48 which your $48 would be your actual cost and your $40 is your standard cost then we take that difference the dollar yeah the $8 difference and apply it to whatever whatever state the buildings those buildings are in one still an inventory gets added to finished goods inventory the ones that have already been sold charged as a variance to adoption alright which I'm not I haven't I didn't break out a very and separately but that's why doctrine over this increases from I'm sorry increases from from $80 to 84 hours okay, so so that would happen like we discussed like the end of every month at the end of every quarter you would have to do that first and then you would do your I'm not showing then you would do your closing transaction which would be to zero out those those accounts the breakroom supplies the repairs and maintenance the shop supplies and also the contra account but before you zero those out you're the total of the your contra account

Speaker 3  33:36
when you when we do our finished goods inventory actual cost allocation after we've done that the contra account and the other l accounts above that should zero each other out

Unknown Speaker  34:00
like you should have negative 48 and $48 worth of charges and then you would contra account close that out at the end of the year that should go to zero and your

Speaker 3  34:22
other child accounts above that should also go to zero. There's I'm missing some details here. It seems like

Speaker 3  34:35
I'm happy to put together a better example of this because we've we've added I'm gonna have to add some more accounts to make this make a little more sense and also detailed a little better on how that would

Unknown Speaker  35:01
function or if you feel like you have this is good enough then

Matthias Miller  35:16
let me see if I can take about three minutes to eyes

Unknown Speaker  35:38
inventory

Matthias Miller  35:47
so these four accounts then when you zero out these four accounts

Matthias Miller  36:03
are these zeroing out with each other

Speaker 3  36:12
the way you zero them out is Bob Okay let's assume let's look at the March 31 and change the breakroom supplies from $25 to $21 Let's assume that we're now at year end that one's $21 We've done our goods inventory and to actual reconciliation this is what we're showing so we get to the end of the year and we said okay all throughout the year we we spent $21 on breakroom supplies $10 on repairs and maintenance and shop supplies were $13 Is that $17 1710 and third teen that's what we incurred all throughout the year that they would function just like an expense account on income statement. And we say okay we used we consumed that to build buildings in the way we move that to finished goods production overhead every time a building was built we moved consents to production overhead and the way we all set that as production overhead number grew the way we all said that was we increase our contract count or negative 40 as well. Now we get to the end of the year and we do a reconciliation so here we have seven

Speaker 3  38:11
and now we're ready to start a new year start January so we say okay now I want to zero out 1710 and 13 so we close out those three accounts and the contra account and then all of them to zero and now we're ready to start again January 1 So that we so that we can see how much are we spending breakroom supplies were seeing how much are we spending for breakroom supplies year to date, much for repairs and maintenance year to date was for job supplies.

Matthias Miller  38:58
Okay, so then, when I guess one question when you zero these out? Well you would you would be zeroing out breakroom supplies. You would decrease breakroom supplies and increase production overhead the inventory right

Speaker 3  39:15
or no not for the closing transaction because we've we've already done that at the same time that we increase the contra account

Speaker 3  39:30
so the the $960 production overhead that one contains that that number contains buildings that were built two years ago and half of the buildings built this year have already been sold and are no longer in finished goods. net total finished goods number so the contra account just gives us a way to move every time we build a building that contract account increases by the the standard costing amount that we apply to building as it's built so if

Matthias Miller  40:30
against the very specific question I'm after is I understand and you broke up and you might have you might have explained this when I when I was

Unknown Speaker  40:43
flaking out a little bit. But what

Matthias Miller  40:48
when you zero out breakroom supplies, what is the corresponding account for zeroing it out?

Unknown Speaker  40:57
The contract count

Matthias Miller  41:00
the contract count

Speaker 3  41:11
so closing transactions is that how's that done? Is that a series of debits and credits? Or is it something else?

Matthias Miller  41:21
It's a series of debits and credits with a specially flagged transaction that says I believe especially play transaction that says ignore this in certain situations but or it's a flag on the account and I don't remember.

Unknown Speaker  41:39
Exactly.

Matthias Miller  41:50
Okay, so let me let me run this through. First, we would reconcile standard costs via the FDA cost allocation. This would cause the FDA sub accounts to balance out a break from supplies repairs and maintenance and shop supplies would balance out with the country count production overhead inventory in the attached PDF example. This, this would this could take the break room supplies on March 25, march 31, from $5 to $17. Second, we would Zerah these four sub accounts using debits and credits between three sub accounts. And the contract contra account

Matthias Miller  42:48
is reflected in December 31 of the attached PDF, then we would run the standard closing process and zero out all expense accounts into an equity account. Son right.

Speaker 3  43:08
Yeah, when you see all the expense accounts into an equity account, then you're talking about the expense accounts on income statement. Right? Are you talking about these? Okay. I think I would I gave the example a little bit I think it would be a little clearer if you would say that change the contra account to show minus 48 rather than 15 to 70 or 25 to 17. Because that's basically what's going to happen. When we do the actual cost allocation, the finishes inventory process, we want to say we thought it was $40 but it actually is $48 We can't change the actual incurred costs. But the contra account would then have to increase to match that and I'm not sure this is kind of down that path right now. But I've been wondering how are we or have we built a handle that when we do the actual cost allocation because at whatever point we should do that at at whatever point we do that we want those two, zero each other out of balance each other out.

Speaker 3  44:50
Yeah, I think using using that example would that change? I think it would make sense Since I think you yeah that would be great on closing transactions

Matthias Miller  45:09
we make a note of the comeback to consider the contra account reconciliation process

Speaker 3  45:25
so I think one thing that I think that will have implications on closing transactions that Joe will obviously need to know about but how do we define how do we define somehow we'll have to I don't know is that or is it set on? What determines what accounts are closed out when we do a closing transaction? Is that something that set on the

Unknown Speaker  45:58
chart of accounts like on that that account itself because it would not it wouldn't be typical for it would be typical for this to happen on revenue and expense accounts but not on an asset account

Speaker 3  46:20
at the end of the typically at the end of the year, you don't say while an asset has now rolled out and we'll start over again

Matthias Miller  46:37
well, I guess in this case, but in most cases, you're also going to zero it out to an equity account. And that's not what you want to do with these I think this is a internal accounting process. That's a we we are using assets in a defensible but

Unknown Speaker  47:02
non

Matthias Miller  47:04
somewhat non standard way and before we run our closing we have to zero we want to zero out these contra accounts

Unknown Speaker  47:16
I like it yeah that's fair ending

Speaker 3  47:31
so you could like in this you could on November 31 In this case you could make a could decrease your break room supplies your repairs and maintenance in your shop supplies buy the full amount and then have a lever the other side of the transaction is a increase your contract count I think it'd be an increase your contract count for that same amount Daniel in that way.

Unknown Speaker  48:30
So then

Matthias Miller  48:45
I will bottom line and follow up with sure then okay. So, basic idea each accounts contribution to the cash flow is determined by the type in subtype.

Unknown Speaker  48:59
And

Matthias Miller  49:01
if no subtype is specified in the account itself doesn't specify cash with categorization will either assume a subtype or throw an error and you know the system switch

Speaker 3  49:16
I would think we would want it to throw an error because if it just assumed something then we're going to be that we have numbers that we can't really be like yeah, it happened.

Unknown Speaker  49:41
We'll note that

Matthias Miller  49:45
each account subject will default specify a default label for its associated line in the cash flow statement, but each account may override that label and the cash flow category if the account should be broken out. either individually or with similar accounts

Speaker 3  50:05
so is is he basically saying that for let's say any

Speaker 3  50:16
revenue a revenue account and any subtypes underneath that the default will be whatever that for the revenue account but it could be overridden if you have one or if you have some that it could be different than

Unknown Speaker  50:38
the new account

Unknown Speaker  50:40
I think so

Matthias Miller  51:14
little sketchy and exactly what I think it might have to talk through with him everything he means with the cash flow line taxes and everything like that but if I had to summarize what I think he's

Speaker 3  51:31
I just had a question like the cash flow line takes what I think you were just ready to summer I think it

Matthias Miller  51:42
means that we're going to have built in flexibility and how we build the Cash Flow Statement think that's basically what he's saying

Matthias Miller  51:59
but I would understand that

Speaker 3  52:01
he's saying that we could get ugly we'll just choose a when we select the word we select from our chart of accounts where it affects the cash flow statement basically use the standard cash flow categories and subcategories but we could also add a thing outside of that for

Unknown Speaker  52:36
then it would show up on the cash flow like this is maybe a silly example but if seeing that oh, if we have something that something on the balance sheet or income statement that we would rate horses or we deal in horses and then we'd want it to show up on the cash flow statement like

Speaker 3  53:10
investments estimates have it show up as horse trading then that would be a way to show a custom custom takes the custom field on the cash flow statement.

Matthias Miller  53:28
Right. I mean, the more practical example might be your storage projects

Unknown Speaker  53:38
Ah, perfect. Yeah. So is that something that clarify with Joel

Unknown Speaker  53:46
yeah

Unknown Speaker  53:49
yeah, thanks for the practical example

Matthias Miller  53:55
always good with this showed up

Unknown Speaker  54:00
I've been I've been told that my my really that good at trying to create parable so I think that

Matthias Miller  54:15
I don't think you want too many parables in accounting and just say.

Matthias Miller  54:47
Okay, so then

Matthias Miller  54:56
period bounties goes to your accounts and December We paid dividends, buybacks and shares this shows up into temporary equity accounts eventually it goes out to two permanent equity accounts. We're gonna cash flow from July to June. Is this as simple as ignoring closing entries? Or does it take more nuance I think we can just ignore coding transaction so ignore the transaction zero out dividends paid and move its debit to retained earnings on December 31. Does that sound right to you that cash flow should ignore temporary closing shouldn't go ignored closing transactions

Speaker 3  55:37
understand this so if we're paying out a dividend that's a thing we pay out like an an owner does a draw

Matthias Miller  55:49
on this case it was it was a purchase of shares via dividend

Speaker 3  56:01
Okay, so in this example it would be say there's a partner there's two partners is 60% one owns 60% and the other 40 And I want to go to 5050 So

Unknown Speaker  56:19
is it is it that type of he yeah

Unknown Speaker  56:30
I guess I

Speaker 3  56:33
guess I'm not 100% I feel like I don't completely understand it but it sounds like it's money going out and then going back in in another area like the same equal amounts

Matthias Miller  56:47
well, you would have a cash Well, it's possible well, that's fair. Because if there would be a cash transaction that wouldn't be a closing transaction. Let's say let's say one owner

Matthias Miller  57:13
one owner wants to buy the other owners share writes a check that gets deposited that's not a closing transaction I mean, equity and temporary and this is maybe simplistic but seems to me like equity No, no closing trans transactions should have any impact whatsoever on cash flow

Matthias Miller  57:45
but that doesn't Well, no, but the possibility is that it could be

Speaker 3  57:58
well think for me it would be helpful if Joel could put an example together a bit more of an example on on on that just like I'm not sure on

Speaker 3  58:42
Well, I guess going back to your your what you're saying is any changes to equity? Were any changes to equity will ignore because equity is basically just the result of what happens to the other accounts.

Unknown Speaker  59:03
Yeah,

Speaker 3  59:05
like if an owner makes a capital contribution of 50,000 equity, his equity is going to go 50,000 But he's also going to

Speaker 3  59:22
most likely he'll he'll hand out a check for 1000 from his personal account into the company's bank account and then that 50,000 would be cashflow would pick it up word word positive into his bank account. It would ignore what happens in equity.

Matthias Miller  1:00:17
I think we can also just tell him on this point so for me, you know I have my uninformed opinion doesn't seem like it should affect the flow of cash but it's probably nuances I don't know what I don't know for you if if you want to if he wants an informed decision from you you really need the debits and credits of the specific example he's talking about and I think I would be comfortable if but it's up to you to how much you would review this if Joel if this passes Joel's inspection I'd be very comfortable with just letting him roll with whatever he deems best let's

Unknown Speaker  1:01:00
let's do that

Matthias Miller  1:01:31
exactly what a closing looks like I think we did that do we use income accounts in the closing process what does that look like the answer is yes we do. And are they all is it all revenue

Matthias Miller  1:01:52
revenue accounts at closing

Unknown Speaker  1:01:58
well yeah all revenue accounts and also all expense

Speaker 3  1:02:13
on on the point above, we might need to define exactly what a closing looks like if Joel could do that I'd be just better understand I don't know if if he if he could

Speaker 3  1:02:33
we don't deep on that but just a basic overview of here's all here's what a closing looks like here's the here are the steps that happen or here's basically what happens when you do a closing that would be be helpful for me to better on trying to better understand that would be

Unknown Speaker  1:03:02
and then

Matthias Miller  1:03:10
be honest, my eyes glazed over just a little bit in his very in depth breakdown of the calculation of the Cash Flow Statement Do you have any feedback on the section

Speaker 3  1:03:28
to him as your as your thoughts? I assume the highlighted areas meant something that but I don't know what exactly what I think he's basically just saying on the left is is what cash flow statement would look like you've got your net income and then the calculation just shows what happens net income is just same as the income statements net income for relevant period then you have your adjustment and then depreciation

Speaker 3  1:04:10
Where were those would come from and how would be calculated subtract gain at a loss I didn't go through those in detail. But I comfortable just going with what he has outlined there.

Matthias Miller  1:04:29
Yeah. Alright, and then he has the example cash flow statements. And then main thing that he's posing that as adding a whole bunch or one of the things adding a whole bunch of financial account subtypes which other would seem quite reasonable.

Speaker 3  1:04:56
So there I said What is it? Why is it Going to add these. I'm assuming he saw those on our, our example of chart of accounts or on Larry's example. And is and then the second question was, Is this the same conversation that we had Wednesday adding, asking for more flexibility or asking for more subtypes, more account subtypes?

Matthias Miller  1:05:26
It's close. I mean, I think it's different. I mean, it's slightly different in that he's asking for these subtypes because these are standard subtypes that would have a specific position and location on the cash flow cash flows report. And yeah, that's why he's asking for them and there's some overlap with what we asked on the other list as well but I don't know that they all overlap but I think the ones so the ones who were asking for like he does not have short term liability he does not have straight short term and long term liability. He has other long term liability, other operating liability etc

Speaker 3  1:06:17
would it be helpful for him to see the final chart of accounts that we reviewed when I think well one concern I have is that we have different

Unknown Speaker  1:06:37
don't have a consistent view of what we call something from balance sheet to the cash flow so as much as we could have those say the same thing.

Speaker 3  1:06:54
Four are useful but you'll be able to put them side to side by side what we don't want is have a balance sheet say current liabilities and then you go over to the cash flow and it says other liabilities and you just have to do your own translations if we can do a one to one and everywhere but I think we

Unknown Speaker  1:07:27
probably could in most cases

Speaker 3  1:07:33
what is he seeing above there add a number of subtypes to the finish list as shipped records what is he what a ship records

Matthias Miller  1:07:46
they mean there so we've got two kinds of subtypes one are ones that we provide but then you can also add your end and so these are ones that would be shipped to you in the accounting system that's part of the standard accounting package

Unknown Speaker  1:08:09
Do you see that a reason why we why we couldn't do a one to one

Speaker 3  1:08:17
what we call it as a cash flow is is also what we call it in either balance sheet in the income statement

Matthias Miller  1:08:31
let me do this.

Matthias Miller  1:09:19
A I think I'll talk to him about how that lines up.

Matthias Miller  1:09:38
Add a cash flow Category field to account subtypes. So each subtype would say the cash flow category and the cash flow line description and then add fields is this if you have it So, if if you have a sub type with a specific position the cash flow statement it has it sounds like it has to be that but if you have an asset without a specified subtype then you could specify you could customize whatever the cash flow whatever the cash flow position should be positioned in text scattering text

Unknown Speaker  1:10:42
so

Speaker 3  1:10:50
the one question or two questions I had here was when, when is this mapping done? And then who does this map we would

Matthias Miller  1:11:02
like you would do for all of the stuff that all the standard types and then for any of your custom types that would be up to you injured to figure out like your storage shed stuff, like you would have to figure out where those types would go or I don't know if that was a separate type or not, but it was like marketing expense would be another example. If you actually have that as a subtype then you need to specify when it goes to cash flow when you set it up

Speaker 3  1:11:35
and if we could overwrite something differently from what you had like on a standard one if for whatever reason I can't think of a good reason why we would want to but could that be overridden?

Matthias Miller  1:11:48
I believe it currently can but from what I'm reading here it doesn't sound to me like he was intending that we would be able to

Unknown Speaker  1:12:04
Okay, he's he's saying like counts receivable or assets accounts receivable those would always be operating slash non cash current asset that's hardwired into

Unknown Speaker  1:12:27
I believe so.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:31
Well, I think when we talk about that oh the finished goods

Unknown Speaker  1:12:44
and then

Matthias Miller  1:12:48
can I can I interrupt for just two minutes we'll be right back.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:23
Sorry about that I'm back

Unknown Speaker  1:14:34
so it seems like the table properties of all subtypes that based on the conversation Wednesday with adding subtypes column on the left where we have the categories that

Unknown Speaker  1:15:00
Have some new ones coming in add it to this column and then go with would add these up Begley in the in the package or you would have to set these fields those say custom subtypes these fields

Unknown Speaker  1:15:34
have that right

Matthias Miller  1:15:45
to Joe would set all these up

Unknown Speaker  1:15:50
and what if we add a new soap

Matthias Miller  1:15:53
but yeah and then if you add a new one then you would need to configure that

Unknown Speaker  1:16:18
then

Matthias Miller  1:16:20
other cash flow groups available you'd have other investment cash flow financing financing interest or other financing cash flow

Matthias Miller  1:16:38
the proper report period and comparison period

Matthias Miller  1:16:51
and then here's three scenarios on sequence of events

Speaker 3  1:17:14
oh he's saying this is just a test to run once the cash flow statement is built

Unknown Speaker  1:17:20
yeah

Speaker 3  1:17:35
got it. So the going back to that list properties of all subtypes I think you add it someone you made changes to

Matthias Miller  1:17:49
yeah, I'll discuss that.

Speaker 3  1:17:54
And those changes would then be like did you hear that Joe? And then Joe would use the new names to map mapping

Matthias Miller  1:18:08
Yeah, I think so I need to talk it through with him and integrate what we wanted to do with those new names over into the cashflow stuff but something like that

Speaker 3  1:18:20
have you had any any conversation with him on those proposed changes or any feedback do

Unknown Speaker  1:18:35
ya

Matthias Miller  1:18:43
good anything more on cash flow

Unknown Speaker  1:18:48
no not other than just thanks for my notes here to talk through the Oh yeah, you're suggesting we do in assets finished goods inventory we do that close those out manually the end of the year and

Unknown Speaker  1:19:19
verify with on cash flow line text if we can would fit the bill for the intended to use be used for something like storage rattling comm SQL for or he says exactly what a closing looks like SQL for or and that to us

Speaker 3  1:20:04
And on the one to one mapping of cash flow subtypes to balance sheet switches

Unknown Speaker  1:20:30
on both reports I think that is all my notes and my what I action items on

Unknown Speaker  1:20:49
I match with what you have.

Matthias Miller  1:20:52
Yeah, I got a whole host of notes here from the call and some questions that I'm sending to John now

Speaker 3  1:21:09
is there is there anything you need from me on cash flow statements at this point?

Unknown Speaker  1:21:16
Nope. It's enjoy

Matthias Miller  1:21:17
my court No.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:20
Okay. You can

Matthias Miller  1:21:25
you get eight extra minutes to prop your feet up on your desk and enjoy a cup of coffee for having knocked out one more thing for the week.

Speaker 3  1:21:37
I like that for positive motivation. So just make sure our schedule or my schedule is I have things to date for next

Unknown Speaker  1:22:02
so I say thing

Speaker 3  1:22:10
until Wednesday, but I'm going to Tuesday I'll find out from Drew well, okay, no stepping back. Oh, Wednesday night, we'll plan to do a 10 to 1030 with through and then again we say a three to 330 Or is it 330 to four three to 330. Right?

Matthias Miller  1:22:39
Or do yes

Unknown Speaker  1:22:43
or no next meetings would be Wednesday, August 9

Speaker 3  1:22:55
and 1030 with through then a one to 230.

Speaker 3  1:23:07
Then that match what do you have? See? Then we would have we have another one Thursday 1145 to 1245. Is that Friday, but that match what do you have for next week?

Matthias Miller  1:23:38
Yes, it does. If you would like I would probably be willing to do

Unknown Speaker  1:23:53
an eight o'clock

Matthias Miller  1:23:56
if you are wanting more time to work through stuff. I probably would be willing to do an eight o'clock Wednesday, Thursday sometime. That sorry, Tuesday, Thursday sometime.

Speaker 3  1:24:10
You're saying for next week or just if we need more ongoing

Matthias Miller  1:24:15
for next? I'm not willing quite yet to commit to that every week but for next week if

Unknown Speaker  1:24:32
it won't work but we could get to Thursday. 745 Why don't we tentatively put it in for for Thursday. And then we'll just play it by ear as we need it or not. That you could do once an hour

Unknown Speaker  1:24:58
I could do an hour and a half

Speaker 3  1:25:01
We're gonna put it in eight to 930 Thursday the 10

Unknown Speaker  1:25:11
or see where we're at

Unknown Speaker  1:25:25
Okay, good.

Matthias Miller  1:25:28
Sounds good. Awesome.

Unknown Speaker  1:25:31
Thanks, guys. Thanks
