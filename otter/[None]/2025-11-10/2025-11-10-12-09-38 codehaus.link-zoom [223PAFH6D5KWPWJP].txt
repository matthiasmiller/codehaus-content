Speaker 1  00:14
The ones next, MERV, you can hop on whenever. Whatever.

Unknown Speaker  06:45
You there, Bubba, yo, I'm here.

Speaker 2  06:48
Hey, let me give me. I just need a couple seconds here. Yeah, I just had it all my brain. I was trying to write stuff down. And it's some couple things slip my Mind,

Speaker 3  07:00
right? It's about

Unknown Speaker  07:22
and you university I

Unknown Speaker  07:43
Oh, yeah, Matt, where do you want to start? Or do you have any? I don't. I don't have any, okay, um,

Speaker 2  07:55
the standard assembly. Okay, thanks for jumping on here. Um, we should try to keep it short, if that's okay for you.

Unknown Speaker  08:03
Yep, it's good to hear, right?

Unknown Speaker  08:05
You have more time tomorrow?

Matthias Miller  08:08
Yeah, I do what? What do you what do you want tomorrow?

Speaker 2  08:12
Well, I'm not, I'm not sure. Let's go through there's a couple things here. Assembly, overview, by item, quantity, invoice and assembled is beside it, next to next, side by side. Then the percentage discrepancy, those numbers are

Unknown Speaker  08:33
somewhere more than 100 um, I think that number got

Matthias Miller  08:39
that's, that's, yeah, you're right. It should be minus minus one or minus 100% well,

Speaker 2  08:53
but some of these are like 17 100% 16/5 I mean,

Matthias Miller  08:58
well, Joe, share your screen. I mean, some, some of these are, like, one versus 15. Is like, that's like a 14 100% discrepancy.

Unknown Speaker  09:11
Okay, here, wait, what am I doing?

Matthias Miller  09:14
Like we we invoice 15, we assemble 15 times more than we invoiced.

Unknown Speaker  09:20
What am I doing?

Speaker 3  09:26
Oh, here, sorry, yes, here we go.

Speaker 4  09:36
People Sing it out my way. Yep, there we go, out of the way.

Unknown Speaker  09:53
Yeah, okay, six,

Unknown Speaker  09:59
okay. Makes sense.

Matthias Miller  10:01
So, I mean, I'll fix the I'll fix the well,

Unknown Speaker  10:07
yeah, I mean,

Speaker 2  10:09
20 invoice 37 assembled. Hey, thanks, Rick, 20 invoice 37 assemble. Matt, that's like, that's less than 100% right?

Matthias Miller  10:23
Yeah, it should be, it should be 85% okay, okay, I don't fix that.

Speaker 2  10:27
That'll make sense. And then, yeah, so these laws five, Yep, yeah, these numbers are looking way, way better than hundreds will be zeros. Okay, that'll help a lot. Up top here, not that it matters, but this total at the bottom is not really an act. I mean,

Matthias Miller  10:56
it's a 9% discrepancy, 7002 divided by 6400, overall.

Speaker 2  11:01
Gotcha, it's nine. Yes, perfect, perfect, not terrible. Okay, so that'll be When. When will you correct that?

Matthias Miller  11:12
I mean, if you don't need it before, then I'll do it tonight. We should update tonight. Or do you need it before?

Unknown Speaker  11:20
No, that, because I understand what it is.

Speaker 4  11:24
So no, that should be fine. I just want to look at something here yet. NH,

Unknown Speaker  11:39
7304, I four.

Unknown Speaker  11:43
Race, where's the 70270? Where'd I get to? I

Unknown Speaker  12:03
missing. Oh, down here. Oh, because these are stock items, yeah. Oh, that's crazy.

Speaker 2  12:17
2360, well, the quantity invoiced in assembly tracker was was around 2700

Speaker 3  12:25
and here it's only showing 23

Unknown Speaker  12:32
that doesn't really make sense.

Speaker 1  12:34
You said the fruit 70270 New Holland.

Speaker 4  12:43
Well, this, yeah, and then this is the one sold as the 6430,

Speaker 2  12:49
again, in assembly tracker. Well, with the historical and completed and everything, it shows 2700 plus, invoiced.

Unknown Speaker  13:01
Okay. Let's just there. Here we go.

Speaker 2  13:04
740 3132 assembled and 2740, needed.

Matthias Miller  13:11
Okay, go back to the what was the other number?

Unknown Speaker  13:16
I don't know how to get rid of that bar up there.

Unknown Speaker  13:26
Here, it's 2360 invoiced.

Speaker 2  13:34
Well, that brings up the other question I'm still not certain of, or are all orders in sage that have been

Unknown Speaker  13:47
canceled deleted some way,

Speaker 1  13:49
okay, no, I'm sorry. Keep going. No, go ahead.

Speaker 2  13:54
Keep going. Well, are all orders that have been in some way, shape or form, canceled or deleted or, you know, I guess, where you have any indication that

Unknown Speaker  14:06
they're not legit. Are we?

Speaker 2  14:10
Are we transferring from Sage orders to then historically, just using the invoiced orders? I um,

Unknown Speaker  14:24
I go back to,

Matthias Miller  14:26
so the assembly tracker is, well, I mean, there's a few places where, well, I think, I think the bottom line is, let me, let me go.

Matthias Miller  14:42
You. Let me go, let me go. Chase this discrepancy. That's the bottom line, and we don't have to take time now I'll figure out where that discrepancy is coming.

Unknown Speaker  14:51
Well, here's total needed,

Speaker 3  14:55
the total needed for this two item codes. I. Showing 2740, wait, hold on, hold on, hold on. Some of these are future,

Unknown Speaker  15:10
not too many. There's 7078,

Unknown Speaker  15:13
future So,

Unknown Speaker  15:16
but again, okay, yep,

Speaker 3  15:43
good. Well, you're so,

Unknown Speaker  15:48
yeah, what do you say?

Matthias Miller  15:49
I'll chase it. I'll get an answer to you by this by by this evening,

Unknown Speaker  15:55
okay, um, so then the other question is, or think we were talking about, that the orders that, what was, I think I texted to you about the there

Matthias Miller  16:21
was an order that you need to mute. No, was it

Unknown Speaker  16:35
all? The other one was

Unknown Speaker  16:41
the, let me get where it

Unknown Speaker  16:52
is. All Right, I'm trying to

Unknown Speaker  17:13
shoot

Speaker 2  17:43
well again, like, do we the orders that are coming in from Sage? We're using those in the assembly tracker window.

Unknown Speaker  17:56
I'm looking at in size 4030, like, here,

Speaker 2  18:01
there I have everything at the bottom. We have the sage orders that have not been this is historical. Sorry.

Unknown Speaker  18:13
Anyway, you know what I'm talking about. Do we

Speaker 2  18:18
when they get changed or deleted is that? Is that happening automatically

Unknown Speaker  18:26
or Yeah,

Speaker 2  18:29
and so any orders that are going to be sitting here at the bottom right are going to be legit. I mean, like,

Unknown Speaker  18:38
what's that should should be

Speaker 2  18:41
legit orders. Well, okay, do they then? Sorry, is there a point in time where

Unknown Speaker  18:53
does if it gets invoiced

Speaker 2  18:58
and the quantity gets changed, it's still the same sage order number with a different quantity, right?

Matthias Miller  19:05
Yes, unless they cancel and recreate it.

Speaker 2  19:09
Well, in that case, then it's a different sage order number, right? But I guess I'm saying, as long as it's the same sage order number, quantity gets changed. Is that being

Unknown Speaker  19:21
reflected? Are we catching

Unknown Speaker  19:23
that in a program?

Matthias Miller  19:24
Yes, it'll show up. So if we if it had previously tied out, and somebody changes the quantity, then it'll show up as being over assembled.

Speaker 5  19:34
It'll still be taught. Would still be tied out. It'll still be tied out as it was. Yeah, the

Unknown Speaker  19:39
quantity would just be changed

Unknown Speaker  19:42
accurate. It

Matthias Miller  19:43
would just say that you built too many

Unknown Speaker  19:46
Sure, but yep, yep,

Speaker 2  19:48
if this, if it was deleted and whatever created a new, a new sage order, are you able to catch that? As well. Are we catching that as well?

Matthias Miller  20:03
I'm sorry, in what situation

Speaker 2  20:05
again, if the order is what you said, you just said it a little bit ago, canceled, and

Matthias Miller  20:11
if it's canceled and recreated, then the canceled one shows needing zero, and we'd have a new one. And so the canceled one would be over assembled by X amount, by the amount of the original order and the new one would be under assembled, right?

Speaker 2  20:26
So every because John and Tina have kept asking about, not often, but like, you know, they they can't delete, they don't know how to delete orders or whatever, but they're being it's being taken care of, right? I mean,

Matthias Miller  20:42
like they're not supposed to. I mean, if they can find a case where it's not being deleted, I want to, I want to know, but

Unknown Speaker  20:47
they're not, yep, yep, right? All right, so everything that's sitting in here is legit. I So,

Unknown Speaker  21:09
all right, I don't know what some of this. I went through the

Speaker 3  21:20
New Holland, 40 by 30s, which is one of our those three stock items. Man, did I? I cleaned up a bunch of just a mess and caught other things along the way. And I mean, just every kind of mistake. Um,

Unknown Speaker  21:38
so anyway, Matt back is the next question was, when I like

Speaker 3  21:54
the window I've opened now has all historical top and bottom? Yep. Um, if I Yeah, if I click on a work order number and then I hit the back arrow, when I'm done, it'll reload this whole thing.

Speaker 2  22:15
And you said so then I was going do that, you know, click on, hit this, open it in a new tab, and then it's it seems to be working pretty well that way. And when I make the change, it seems to show up. Does that seem accurate?

Matthias Miller  22:40
I'm not super familiar with what all. I think there were some recent platform changes to refresh, to do better refreshes, and I am not tracked exactly what's happening with that

Speaker 2  22:51
if I hit refresh, it'll take a while. Well, yeah, but I haven't been hitting Well, only if I needed to, I guess, sure, but it does seem to be transferring back and forth, like, well, I'll give you an example here's like

Unknown Speaker  23:12
this, right here mess i I've fiddled with it a couple different ways, um, long story short,

Speaker 2  23:24
these guys, same two guys. They did two eight runner blocks, which is not assembly. Then they assembled 19 pallets. It takes 208 to build 104 I put the 19 in here. I couldn't tie these two together, so I ended up deleting the 19 I was trying to tie. I mean, I was trying to tie them all three together. Not really a big deal, because it's different guys. But what am I doing wrong that I can't get these three tied together?

Matthias Miller  23:54
I mean, you should be able to go to to the 50. This guy, I don't know. Try this guy. Yep. And then 16, 739, is the one that we want to so scroll down and then hit Add new row in the partial work order

Unknown Speaker  24:11
right here, yeah, but it's not coming up.

Matthias Miller  24:17
Not sure. Go back to the previous screen or previous tab.

Speaker 4  24:28
Don't need a new laptop. I dropped out things driving me nuts Anyway, yes, shut up in this guy. Hang on.

Matthias Miller  24:42
Yeah, open that here. Yeah, open that guy, open that in a new tab, and then scroll, scroll down. Yeah, hit completed work order.

Unknown Speaker  24:56
Oh, okay, I.

Matthias Miller  25:00
So it's already tied out to this. This one,

Unknown Speaker  25:06
okay, it's

Matthias Miller  25:09
tied out to partial. There was none,

Unknown Speaker  25:16
okay, um,

Unknown Speaker  25:24
you're saying a sage or a partial sage order.

Unknown Speaker  25:28
Yeah, here's what I should do.

Unknown Speaker  25:36
Hang on, there's some old cleanup. So if we have

Unknown Speaker  25:48
order partial,

Unknown Speaker  25:59
I'll be right back. Yep,

Matthias Miller  26:52
I Okay, so we have go back into the into the where we had just been, not this guy, but I mean the original.

Unknown Speaker  27:51
Here's tracker

Matthias Miller  27:53
12. Let's go into 12, 529,

Unknown Speaker  27:57
think that's here, yep. And

Matthias Miller  27:59
then hit the drop list again.

Speaker 3  28:05
Or, yeah, no, I didn't delete that Yep, delete that one. Yeah, here we go. That guy. Now, just hit save. Yeah. Okay. Now, if I

Matthias Miller  28:31
now, if you refresh this one, it'll group it together.

Unknown Speaker  28:35
Yep, it's there. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  28:38
So, okay, it takes care of that. Questions.

Unknown Speaker  28:46
Matt on new assembly work order when entering times for the guys,

Speaker 2  29:00
if you hit an employee, enter start time, end time, oh, I guess we always have to enter am and pm. Could that? Could that be sort of done automatically, where it's if it's before 12, it's am,

Matthias Miller  29:24
any anything from 12 to five is, am, anything from from six to sorry, anything from six to 12 is AM, anything from 12 to five is PM, or something like that. So you're what you want. I'm not. I'm asking.

Speaker 2  29:39
No, that's perfect. But it doesn't. I don't think it was taking that Well, was it?

Matthias Miller  29:44
No, it's not. Do you want to be able to put in, what all are we

Speaker 2  29:52
I just like to just put in, like, the numbers and then let it that doesn't. I.

Matthias Miller  30:01
So you can do

Unknown Speaker  30:04
10, a or Oh, that way. What if

Unknown Speaker  30:09
it's 1005, or

Unknown Speaker  30:12
so you would want to do?

Unknown Speaker  30:21
Yeah, we can't. I can't. Well,

Speaker 2  30:26
just it was simplified, maybe a little bit, if it's not too crazy, so you're but I wasn't seeing the P come up, or am or pm, wasn't really coming up.

Unknown Speaker  30:37
Um, I mean, you could do,

Matthias Miller  30:39
what's that? What's that? I mean, you can do something similar. You can do 1p in 5p as an example. But no, we're not doing anything automatically.

Unknown Speaker  30:53
Okay, no, that's fine. So if so, if it's like, you know, 735,

Unknown Speaker  31:06
can I do? Can I just type in 735,

Unknown Speaker  31:10
or do I need no, not currently now,

Unknown Speaker  31:12
need the spaces there.

Matthias Miller  31:17
Need a colon, yeah, there's am. You can also put in you can also put 14. You can also put 14 colon, 00, with the colon in there.

Speaker 4  31:33
Oh no, I have to hit the Share that guy. Have to hit the huge shift bar, I guess right to All right,

Speaker 4  31:52
yeah, all right. Well, I mean, if that could be simplified a little bit sometime, it'd be all Right, but not a pressing thing. Um, so

Speaker 2  32:22
let's see lumber. That lumber question, man, I had the other day think I was on the text. The difference maybe we yeah, we talked about

Matthias Miller  32:33
Yeah. I have not had a it's on my list. I could look at that this afternoon as well.

Speaker 2  32:37
Yeah, I have that that was in a text. I give you the amount that Rick showed and then the amount that Miller and assembly report was showing.

Speaker 2  32:54
Work Order, 1345, if I can, I search a work order number, anyway, anyway,

Speaker 1  33:04
not yet, but I can give you the ability to that's

Unknown Speaker  33:07
fine. Well, here

Unknown Speaker  33:12
would I search that in assembly tracker?

Matthias Miller  33:16
Yeah, I mean eventually, yeah, okay, if I make that change, yeah, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  33:23
Well, 13451,

Speaker 4  33:26
I see if I can find that guy quicker. No, I can't. Well, there it is. 13451,

Speaker 2  33:37
that was a Sunday. Sunday. I gotta find it. That's fine. There it is. Never mind my question. I'll do that next. Um,

Unknown Speaker  33:59
oh, the MX 33 that was the other one. That was that random,

Unknown Speaker  34:07
crazy bar in the top.

Unknown Speaker  34:09
Any tips for me to get rid of that bar on the top?

Matthias Miller  34:12
It is the zoom bar, yeah, just move it around. Or the, I don't know which part I can't see it,

Unknown Speaker  34:20
this guy, right? Oh, you can't see that. Yeah, I don't know how to move it. Oh, yeah, I can move it.

Speaker 4  34:30
Let's move you down here, buddy, he's down at the bottom. Now, that's nice.

Speaker 3  34:35
Ah, I didn't move it. Awesome.

Speaker 2  34:45
You try get it, you get some humor out of out of our conversations, even if you can't laugh at me out loud,

Unknown Speaker  34:55
fair enough. Oh, shoot, um.

Speaker 2  35:02
I was trying to look at, oh yeah, MX, 33 I don't think I have that open anymore. This guy right here is a pricing

Speaker 4  35:13
that's something we got to look at. What we got here 19. This was 48 by 30. I could this wouldn't, yeah, that did. Let me close good. I was a 4830 I need to close that guy.

Unknown Speaker  35:32
Another 4031 is that 70270? I got,

Speaker 2  35:42
I gotta make a decision whether I just correct it myself. This guy said, two eight assembled in eight hours. Here. They did 104 and five and a half. They never did 208 like there. They did here. They did 193 and eight and a half hours. And then down here there's 184 in like six seven hours. And then here, these guys did 106 I know they didn't make them that fast, because they never do, but yet they're,

Unknown Speaker  36:13
well, hang on, they're not

Unknown Speaker  36:17
what's that they're making.

Unknown Speaker  36:20
They're making 100 in 10 hours,

Speaker 2  36:25
104 and like six or seven hours,

Matthias Miller  36:28
Where's, where's the six or seven, like, right here, 104 6.6 that's 12 hours. They made 104 and 12. I mean, well, it's six hours together, right together?

Speaker 2  36:39
I mean, sorry, yep, in six hour as a team here we did 160 and, you know, seven and a half hours. It I don't damn maybe they went that fast. It's just why. Then sometimes here's 104 and four and a half hours, because they just don't go that fast. Here's 104 and five hours. And then up here you got 104 in six hours. Here you got 113 704 and five and a half hours. I don't know maybe they do, but he said, sometimes so many other guys make the runner blocks. I went through every work order of this. NH, 70270, the last two years. I just got done to spend hours doing it today, and I'm still not 100% satisfied with,

Matthias Miller  37:37
yeah, well, I mean, if this is, if this is actually what's happening on the so what's your best guess? Is it just these guys are really like, they got good days and bad days, or,

Speaker 2  37:49
yeah, well, sometimes the somebody else, like he'll have guys assemble the runner blocks. It's a two step process. Or it can be a two step process. Or they can do the runner blocks and know on the boards at the same time. The question is, is there anyone's in here where somebody else knows the runner blocks but nobody tracked? Right? That's the question, right? Good chance that happened. Or, like, for example, this right here, I just want to delete this. One 208 in eight hours, 104 in five and a half hours. Did they make 208 runner blocks? Because there's two per so 208 runner blocks here, but then it's three weeks later. Then they nailed them together like

Unknown Speaker  38:42
that's my 10.

Speaker 2  38:43
And then here, here we had 618 these two guys started these it was the end of the day on a Thursday. On Friday, they did 193 in eight and a half hours. Then Monday morning, they did another 67 in three hours, which is pretty good, but they usually don't make them that fast, and especially not with this guy right here working on them, like, it's like, I just think they're screwed up. I just And then, and then I'm looking at, we assembled 30 132 in the last you know, and that, I mean, that number was changing. I was going through all this stuff, I disconnected on I unlinked almost everything, just because it's a stop order thing. Then I look down here at the bottom, that's the question I was asking you shooting. And I can't see it on my side, because I got this bar here. But again, the 2700 versus what we're showing in the assembly thing. I do need an accurate number on that. So once you give me that answer, that'll help me. It's okay if we assembled a few more than we sold in the last two years. But it should be, should be about the same, and it's currently, I'm not sure how close we are, right? Yeah, you know if. If any of these guys are getting credit, or any of these numbers, and I sorted through on the papers, but some of the, you know, two or eight runner blocks, 25 and 79 pounds, that makes perfect sense. Good deal. We did that in so it took us, you know, 4560, but eight hours to do 104 I and, and that's fine. But then when you start talking about 190 and eight hours now, I'm and I don't have any record of anyway, just tell we don't.

Matthias Miller  40:35
We don't have paper copies of the old sheets. Do we? We just throw them out. I

Speaker 5  40:41
just do all the sheet I have. Yeah, right here. Look stacks,

Speaker 2  40:48
and I found a lot of mistake. I mean, lot of different other mistakes, all kinds of mistakes, wrong, well, a missing guy, dates, hours time. I mean, it could be anything. The wrong, Oh, wrong item code was entered. So now the data is in a different, you know, just because I was looking through some paper.

Unknown Speaker  41:09
Yeah. I mean,

Speaker 2  41:13
if I'd be sitting in a Crystal Tower with like, glass all around, I'd be sitting there on my like, or standing, sitting, whatever, just all the data like that could be fun, but sitting in this dungeon, looking at this stuff and knowing that mistakes, it just drives me nuts to think that there's maybe more mistakes being made right now, and I can't track it all the time. I can't just stand there and watch and so, you know, it's like, there's this idea that you know you were here, and thanks for coming, and I got a better system. And then last week, we had a huge mistake. I told you about that, right?

Matthias Miller  41:50
Yeah, yeah, the incentive mistake. But see, here's where, here's where I like, okay, you can rant and rave. I still think it's completely solvable. Okay, so I mean, anyway, we keep going round and round, but, but until we put checks and balances in place and and put this in somebody else's a little like it's very clearly, put it in this, until we put a clear system in place with the right person running the system to make sure that we get accurate, accurate data, like there's no, there's not going to be any, any heads or tails. And I think, yeah, I think there's a work I don't think you actually have to have, well, I think, I think you, I think you have to have a way to have a senior person at some level, make judgment calls about what gets written on the sheets. But I think you can, I have a theory that you can handle anywhere from 70 to 95% of it, and have things flagged that need to get flagged appropriately. But anyway, be that as it may

Speaker 2  42:56
so you think in more checks and balances.

Matthias Miller  43:01
Well, I think, I think step number one is this, this, to me, is a perfect, it is a perfect, delegatable task to the right kind of person, right? And the fact that we have digital copies, if you really wanted to, and it's not an expensive person either. Like, okay, here's just little more context. I don't know if any of these people are available, but we have a company, the company that it's actually the company that's built this silver limb platform, most of the like the back end of the silver bloom platform, they have an entire team of data analysts in Bangladesh that they their only job is go through financial statements and go input numbers, read them off, because you've got financial statements coming from all kinds of different places, And it's never the exactly the same from anywhere, and they are their job, literally, is, every month, to go through all the financial statements that they collect from every from all their sources and input them into a system. And so there are, very clearly ways to we have all the data. We have all the original if we have all the original sheets, we may actually be better off coming up with a methodology to re input these sheets and and or not re input, but cross verify or something,

Speaker 2  44:38
but the sheets are not I mean, the data that's written on the sheets is

Unknown Speaker  44:44
that's not accurate.

Speaker 2  44:45
Sometimes suspect, sometimes not very clear at all.

Matthias Miller  44:51
So it's literally illegible.

Speaker 2  44:53
He's not holding them to He's not holding them accountable for the accurate item ID, no. Miller in the right box, some of the information on who was on the floor, like who was on the station, especially when they switch around. One guy bounces here or there, or leaves or doesn't come in, or got all the different it's it's just a hodgepodge of,

Unknown Speaker  45:19
I mean, it's not, it's a layer deeper.

Unknown Speaker  45:21
It is, anyway, cool, if, yeah, if it'd be simply to input, then, all right, understood, I have to,

Unknown Speaker  45:40
Okay, what else

Unknown Speaker  45:41
trying to think here

Speaker 2  45:53
for right now? That's Oh, MX, 33 what tomorrow? Here we are. MX, right? Sorry, and that's a pricing thing, right there. So one of the other items for pricing analysis, what was that about?

Unknown Speaker  46:17
That was about fasteners.

Matthias Miller  46:20
Yeah, this is what the pricing, assembly, time calculations.

Unknown Speaker  46:30
All right, so,

Unknown Speaker  46:38
Matt, this guy, um,

Matthias Miller  46:43
um ran so we said, we said it should yield half half inch by one.

Unknown Speaker  46:58
Go ahead.

Speaker 2  46:59
Well what we need to assemble. The item is right here, 3.6 layers of 40 inch, layers of half by random width by 50. Yep, the thickness is half inch. The width is 144 which is the 3.6 now here we have quantity is one, one of those hassles. Dimensions, half random width by 53.6 layers thickness, half inch width, 144 random width, yes, length, 50, no, size or raw material. Info, one inch by random with oak, that's correct. Enable sawing multiplier saw one. Miscellaneous prep is the clean oak random, which is the one inch saw one. Yield quantity. Where's this good? Point five coming from

Matthias Miller  48:01
it's it's half a layer, 4040. Is half. 40 is a layer, and then the multiplier turns into half a layer. Is something like that? Is that, right?

Speaker 2  48:15
Yeah, but this number doesn't make sense.

Matthias Miller  48:20
Well, why is this yielding only 4040? Inches of random? I don't know. So, I mean, in my mind that the saw one yield width should be 144 it's yielding.

Unknown Speaker  48:32
But where's it getting this number from?

Matthias Miller  48:34
I don't know. Somebody put it in

Unknown Speaker  48:36
there. You serious? Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  48:42
I thought that was an automatic

Speaker 2  48:49
saw one year with, I guess. I mean, if this would say your quantity one, if this would,

Matthias Miller  48:57
if you would change it, that's what I was trying to say on Friday, when we ran out of time. I ran out of time is, if you just do that, okay, then it's 1.8 layers of one by random width by 50 coming off at saw one, which is exactly what's what you want,

Speaker 2  49:14
a sole one, your thickness is one inch. So on all of these, we have to do the width here and here, that's fine, yeah, okay. I thought that was an automatic calculation.

Matthias Miller  49:33
Well, because I mean, sometimes you're splitting. I mean, it depends your multiplier, sometimes affects sickness, sometimes width and so we're just making you put in

Speaker 3  49:41
Yeah. Well, yeah, so we, yeah, okay, okay,

Speaker 2  49:55
so, so one new quantity now would be 1.8 layers. One by random width by 50. Yeah, if I said, What if I said,

Unknown Speaker  50:17
point five on that.

Speaker 4  50:20
But it can't yield a half inch. So anyway,

Matthias Miller  50:27
well, you're, I mean, it's not smart enough to detect that you're doing something crazy, because you can't multiply by two. It's relying on the fact that the dimensions are going to are going to be in half one way or the other, yeah, and it's not smart enough to verify that board feet or something is sure.

Speaker 2  50:58
Yeah, well, yeah, so L and M, L, M is never a multiplier. The only multiplier is

Unknown Speaker  51:09
this pendu splitter.

Speaker 4  51:14
Anyways, okay, yeah, that makes sense. Then we'll just

Speaker 2  51:21
do we if we enter it up here? Does it automatic goes into here, right? Matt, yeah, it's

Matthias Miller  51:27
just, it's exactly the same thing. It's just horizontal versus vertical, yep, right.

Unknown Speaker  51:38
What if I would say it's half by 144 by 50?

Unknown Speaker  51:44
Would it still?

Matthias Miller  51:45
Then it would just show one, a quantity of one, but a width of 144 right?

Speaker 2  51:53
Well, you have the three point. You have a calculator working here. Would it then not work if I change that,

Unknown Speaker  52:02
change which to 144,

Unknown Speaker  52:06
the rent, the RW here. I

Matthias Miller  52:07
mean, if you change it not to be random width, it would, I mean, it would still work. It's, it's weird, but

Unknown Speaker  52:17
I cannot, actually,

Matthias Miller  52:19
I mean, you can uncheck, you can uncheck random width and have it report not as layers, but as a single item.

Speaker 4  52:25
There we go, half by 144, by 50. Perfect, perfect. No, that's great. It's good,

Unknown Speaker  52:34
but we're entering the dimension

Unknown Speaker  52:37
here. Here

Speaker 2  52:41
again, did I Oh, here's the link. So I enter it in here, or or here, got it makes sense?

Unknown Speaker  52:50
Makes sense? Yep,

Speaker 2  52:51
okay, yeah, I did not know. I didn't understand. I didn't

Unknown Speaker  52:56
understand. It was okay,

Speaker 2  52:57
all right, good deal. Um, that's all I have right now.

Speaker 3  53:01
Hit Save Then, save it. Yeah, I'm assuming

Unknown Speaker  53:08
Yeah, I just did there, yep,

Unknown Speaker  53:11
all right, um, yeah, tomorrow, what's

Speaker 2  53:21
I mean, flat by ear. What's a good time

Matthias Miller  53:25
for you? Tomorrow? I'm free anytime, except 12 to 130 Eastern afternoon is better. It's generally better for me. But I can make, yeah, I can make anything work.

Unknown Speaker  53:38
If, yeah, if,

Speaker 2  53:43
sorry, I'm trying to think here, sure, maybe if you get to a spot where I don't want to bug you when you're in the middle of something either, if, I mean, whatever makes the best sense for us to well,

Matthias Miller  53:56
what's what's good for you? I mean, best times for me are, I it I do when I can. I like keeping my morning times for focus time. That's when I'm the most focused for some of the for just getting stuff done. So best time for me is like 130 on or, you know, 10 to 12. So if you know, if you know right off, that there's a part of the day that's better, that's great. Or we can just play it by ear, and you can text me and let me know how your day's stacking

Speaker 2  54:28
up. Yeah, no, the one you mean 130 Eastern or 130 year time,

Unknown Speaker  54:31
yeah, 130 Eastern, yeah. That's good. All right, that's good. So then

Speaker 2  54:39
my data more is a little chopped up. I can't remember. Let me look real quick, Matt.

Speaker 2  54:56
Oh yeah, that's there's a guy here from 12 to one. Or so, so, yeah, I'm not sure. So, oh yeah. Well, let's connect sometime in the afternoon, then or after. Yeah, sounds good. Matt,

Matthias Miller  55:08
all right, I'll send an invite tentatively, and we can touch base.

Speaker 2  55:12
Yeah, that's fine. Well, just not before 130 Eastern

Unknown Speaker  55:16
Yep.

Speaker 2  55:19
Okay, well, oh, I know what it was pricing. Matt,

Unknown Speaker  55:23
yes,

Unknown Speaker  55:28
good conversation around that.

Speaker 2  55:34
Here's an example this. I Are you looking at this? Can you see this?

Unknown Speaker  55:38
Yep, all right, so this palette is

Speaker 2  55:41
7957 AR. Let me go back here to the

Unknown Speaker  56:04
Okay, here's 179, by 6279

Speaker 2  56:09
by 57 on the 6248 board feet, and the 50 has 44 not much difference. Look at the difference in price. You know, that's the kind of stuff. There's a, I know there's more of these bigger ones that are just,

Speaker 3  56:30
yeah, um, and, and, like, I

Speaker 4  56:36
had a conversation the other day with, you know, with Rick about it, and it's,

Speaker 2  56:43
you know, I told him, I mean, I understand that prices are going to vary sometimes with market pressure or volume, etc, but I said, I still don't think. I said, from what I can see and gather and my years of experience, it seems to me that some of the bigger stuff is not, probably not where it should be, and especially the New Holland. And, you know, so he's verbalizing support for the new pricing, a new pricing module.

Unknown Speaker  57:23
And I think he,

Unknown Speaker  57:28
yeah, yeah, so,

Matthias Miller  57:35
so one, one question would be, when actually, you sent an email about this, and I haven't caught up on all my Email. My emails.

Unknown Speaker  57:59
Sure. Yeah, go ahead.

Matthias Miller  58:02
I mean, yeah, sometimes, sometime, I don't care. This is all based on when you have capacity and all that. I got plenty of stuff, stuff with with George's what George needs, but continuing the conversation on, to me, it's like, let's lumber pricing is the most natural next step to drill into in my mind. Yeah.

Speaker 2  58:25
So when you say lumber pricing, can you

Matthias Miller  58:28
elaborate like the pricing for the lumber or the material? Like, if you think of, if you think of pricing in terms of components, various parts, raw material, production, labor, production, neighborhood,

Speaker 2  58:44
etc, yeah. So, you mean, like, basically, like, lumber and sawing is great,

Matthias Miller  58:49
yeah, lumber and saw Well, yeah. I mean, how do we want to handle sewing? How do we, in my mind, we need a short term solution to come up with some kind of pricing for sawing,

Speaker 2  59:02
yeah. And, I mean, again, we can, we can track all this stuff on the different machines.

Matthias Miller  59:07
But, you know, but we need something before we can start tracking something that's good enough before we can start.

Speaker 2  59:16
Okay, so the simple thing, obviously, is you get, take board footage, and you take, I mean, board, board footage is a big indicator. And then how many different processes, you know, does that material run through? And we can see it in the item data, right? Say, yep, you know, we take it, we put on a sizer, or we put it on so one or then we have, how many saws does it pass through? Like that is the simple nuts, simple like, Okay, how many different sawing processes does this

Unknown Speaker  59:52
material go through? Now,

Speaker 2  59:57
you know, with that being said, like the. If you run it through that pendu Ripper plane, or is that what we call that?

Speaker 3  1:00:05
It's an item, stuff. We're here, right here. So like splitter, yeah, what do we say? Pendu splitters up. We're

Speaker 2  1:00:17
calling that thing. I mean this thing here, we can rip it and we can plane it down, and we can split it so we can, you know, we can do a lot, same thing with a gang saw,

Unknown Speaker  1:00:36
I guess, the fact of the matter is like, if,

Speaker 2  1:00:44
yeah, this gets cut on the L M, then it gets ran through the ran through the pendu splitter. Or it might get cut on the on M and ran through a band saw, whereas, if it goes on a gang saw, or, like the sizer, will we say, then it can be cut to length and planed and ripped and split essentially and ran through the notch or all in one shot. So we just have to capture the different, the different cuts. Everything needs cut the length and everything needs cut to a certain width and a certain thickness. So those three, those three demand everything's three dimensional, right? So the three dimensions are happening on a size, or they don't happen on the other saws, because it's either getting cut on a if it gets cut on the L and M that cuts it to length, and if it goes through a band saw or the pendu splitter, that's the other two dimensions, the width and the height, the width and the thickness going somewhere with this thing, yeah, I am, I guess I am.

Speaker 2  1:02:13
I mean, there's an inherent cost that kind of goes along with the with those three dimensions. But what we need there just is what we need. We can, we could sort of come up with that. But then what we what we need to capture is, hey, was it notched? Hey, was it slotted? Hey, did it have angle cuts put on it, like those other steps,

Unknown Speaker  1:02:37
which, here we go. I mean, if it's

Speaker 2  1:02:47
it's just, if it's a any, anything other than sizer, l and m, pendu, splitter, three head band. Saw like I could pretty quickly say, yeah, if it's boring machine, that's an additional step, the chop. What

Unknown Speaker  1:03:14
is that?

Speaker 2  1:03:16
Oh, that's one we don't have yet. If it's slaughter saw, that's another step. If it's can tech, it's if that's not necessarily, it's just shortening. Ben Saul is he saw, if it's, we're not catching the notching,

Matthias Miller  1:03:41
that's, that's mostly in the Miscellaneous, in the miscellaneous prep, or somewhere.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:46
Well, yeah, if it gets

Unknown Speaker  1:03:48
Okay, let me go to

Unknown Speaker  1:03:56
sorry. Here we go. Let me do this. Or I are no type faster. Here we go.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:12
These runners.

Speaker 2  1:04:15
We run these on the gang, saw Keystone, sizer, data, toppler, you Poplar.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:23
There you go. Miscellaneous prep, not

Speaker 2  1:04:28
so if anytime it has a notch, boom slot. So notch is extra. Slot is extra. What else do we do? Chamfer is extra bevel or corners cut, that's extra drill holes. That's extra, you know? So there's, there's like, six or seven different things that we can do otherwise. But I. That's it.

Matthias Miller  1:05:02
So then, in my mind, as a starting point, can we look at all can we look at all orders over a period of time? Look at the total selling payroll over that time period. Total? What selling payroll? Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then weight each of these items based on their relative difficulty times times the order quantity. And use that to come up with a baseline scoring for sawing labor, yeah, and then we come up with machine overhead values as well. Yeah, something like that. And, I mean, is it perfect? No, it's not, but it gives us something that's at least in the ballpark we think

Speaker 3  1:05:53
for sure. I mean, yeah, if we take historical absolutely,

Matthias Miller  1:05:59
yeah, all you're really trying to do is trying to divvy up best, best you can tell. How was the workload? How was the workload distributed across these orders? Right?

Unknown Speaker  1:06:09
Right? Yeah. I mean, if every, if exactly

Speaker 2  1:06:17
those extra things that you do, like drilling holes or slotting or notching or bevel Well, actually, some are more, but mostly they take as long or longer than the three dimensional part of it.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:37
Wow. I

Speaker 2  1:06:43
I mean, they just do because we don't have a, you know, we don't have a, how would you say, like the gang saw is like an assembly line, man, it's just put in a stick on the one end and get a smaller Three 3d piece one, and get a smaller 3d piece on the other that's and you can do it pretty fast. It's geared up for it. But when you talk about drilling holes, slotting, you can run it through there pretty fast. Notching, we're doing that in line. That's happening pretty fast. But then you do like a bevel cut, or

Unknown Speaker  1:07:18
drill holes, chamfer.

Speaker 2  1:07:23
Yeah, we just have to look at it. Break it down, yep. Anyways, all right, all right, I should go, Yeah, I have a get on a call here. Something else. Thanks, man,

Unknown Speaker  1:07:39
yeah, still not done with the reviews, but making progress.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:45
Yeah, yeah, haven't finished anybody's yet, but

Unknown Speaker  1:07:51
yeah, it'll be all right.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:54
It'd be all right. Has the form been helping?

Speaker 2  1:07:58
I think it's gonna Yeah. I mean, I haven't, again, I haven't sat with anybody yet, but I got three back so far, and I worked on two of them on my end.

Speaker 3  1:08:08
So yeah, the form is going to be things will be very helpful. It's going to be very effective.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:16
And just agreeing on those things and then,

Speaker 3  1:08:21
yeah, doesn't make it all easy, but it's gonna help provoke some conversations. That's the goal this year. So, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:08:39
yeah, anyway. All right, I'll let you go.

Speaker 3  1:08:42
Thanks, man. All right, that's good. Appreciate it. See ya.
