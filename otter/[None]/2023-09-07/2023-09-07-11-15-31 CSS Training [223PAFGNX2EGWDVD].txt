Unknown Speaker  05:15
Hello

Unknown Speaker  05:41
he's been right so

Unknown Speaker  06:02
LS here

Speaker 1  06:45
Yeah, I was just talking about knocking about the duplicate been thing. And he was wondering if I remember details from earlier in the, like the initial design development because he said the way the code is written, it's written that it's specifically a it specifically disallows bins duplicate bins for vehicles of the same type.

Unknown Speaker  07:17
And

Speaker 1  07:20
like it, it's seems too specific for it to have just been a bug in the code. Like they specifically were allowing for duplicates of different types. So he was wondering like, if I remembered anything so I was looking at the spec and whatnot and yeah, anyway, it's interesting that it was it was coded very specifically

Unknown Speaker  07:43
well like that

Unknown Speaker  07:51
so

Speaker 1  07:52
anyway, I couldn't find anything. So it must have been a bug but like are they for some reason coded that way? An error but

Unknown Speaker  08:09
it's interesting that it was that specifically coded

Unknown Speaker  08:14
that way anyway

Speaker 2  08:24
okay, Google the sea of vehicles are different types can have the same been general

Unknown Speaker  08:30
Hmm.

Unknown Speaker  08:51
No two cars have been. One thing is to

Unknown Speaker  09:08
huh,

Speaker 2  09:10
on fact, then is designed with a clever system to determine whether the code you've been given given is legitimate. You multiply all the letters together except for the nine then divide the result by 11. You should be left with the nine digit

Speaker 1  09:30
Interesting. Yeah, I remember when we were building it out. It was it's really interesting. All the stuff that's that's included in the VIN, like the manufacturer and the year and maybe even the manufacturer location. Yeah, I read there was I remember something about there being a check digit, which must be the ninth one that validates all of it.

Unknown Speaker  10:03
yeah that's

Speaker 2  10:04
no two cards though within 30 years of each other kind of have the same bit

Unknown Speaker  10:23
that's interesting

Speaker 1  10:49
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's yeah, it's obviously a bug. Yeah. Heaving

Unknown Speaker  10:56
Ellis Ellis

Speaker 1  11:22
Okay, where do you want to go all right, um, I guess first off Are there any are there any of the jobs that you would have? Yeah, they're in your core that you would want to be able to chat about

Speaker 3  11:40
let's take a quick look at X f b change requests I mean you probably did with Nokia and but I'm really curious to see where we're at

Speaker 1  11:51
Yeah, I was working through those the other day he and I didn't go through them one by one he said they're working on them and it's one of our coded but yeah, it could be good to buzz through these this one working up from the bottom so we've got these three encoding so those are in CCS core this one I'm waiting to hear back from shugar and that one

Speaker 3  12:29
and see I'm wanting them to get started on I wonder if I should let me quickly pull up the product changes here because I can jump into client scope

Unknown Speaker  12:41
so.

Unknown Speaker  13:24
Okay

Unknown Speaker  13:55
yeah okay

Unknown Speaker  13:55
fine I'll just ask him to try to have these things ready for testing by Monday the ones that are started already the Change Template fonts

Speaker 3  14:21
let me just I can probably tell you pretty quickly

Unknown Speaker  14:26
okay

Speaker 3  14:32
I guess I can't standard external.

Unknown Speaker  14:51
Gracious of Salida.

Unknown Speaker  14:58
Opening about 15 templates Uh

Unknown Speaker  15:09
Okay That one's cool oops

Unknown Speaker  15:17
that was weird hacky just a second here

Unknown Speaker  15:49
Shoot

Unknown Speaker  16:35
Lavery sorry I thought I could open them all at once but that didn't work so well to libre

Speaker 3  16:55
it looks like we're using a lot of code libre actually. Which ones was it that works? Well I can see here on the job

Unknown Speaker  17:07
so you said standard adjustment of school designations.

Unknown Speaker  17:14
Okay

Unknown Speaker  17:24
Okay, those are over in the probably face builders

Speaker 3  17:51
Yep, that one's Baskerville. Okay?

Speaker 3  18:05
I mean, 93 I think he's right. I think these are the only ones. I didn't quite go through 40. But almost all the ones that I'm opening up. So I kind of think they went they actually did go through them. Okay. So, so I think you can go ahead and take that to the client. I mean, I quite frankly, I'm not even sure we have to take it to the client, I would almost make the change and just keep driving forward. Because it's causing page break stuff problems for us.

Unknown Speaker  18:51
Okay,

Speaker 3  18:52
how do you keep track of which draft items are are higher? I mean, do you use the priority? Or how do you keep track of which draft items need to be need to be addressed?

Speaker 1  19:06
Well, usually there aren't this many items going for one client at once? Sure. So usually, it's just, it just keeps going.

Speaker 1  19:24
I probably don't do a good job of I mean, I just tried to keep them all going short. And if if one I know is priority, high priority and try to double one, but I don't we don't have a good system. As for prioritization,

Speaker 3  19:43
the cleanup Thank you. Thank you and postcard feature. I'm just marking that one. Approved. It does need a spec. The it's coded already with a testing dev input shoot Uh huh The

Unknown Speaker  20:10
Thank you postcard feature when sent to should be sent to SP donors. Y'all may want to clarify that but that one is now in the testing dev input side of things

Unknown Speaker  20:38
and a wonder

Unknown Speaker  20:58
let's take a look at the let me just give you the URL so you can

Unknown Speaker  21:14
let's take a look at the testing Devin puts on this one because

Unknown Speaker  21:20
I put it in the chat

Speaker 3  21:30
don't worry about I'm not editing it so it's

Unknown Speaker  21:43
Yeah, I would be

Speaker 3  21:55
we can relate that to the SPS business application

Speaker 3  22:08
let's write up a separate change request for that though, so that we can push this job through testing I think do I think do I believe that?

Unknown Speaker  22:32
Let me hear let me just actually, I'll add a comment there.

Speaker 3  22:50
Now is Austin priests questions answered then?

Speaker 1  22:56
No, he's still his first comment up there about needing ti on setting up the records is something he's still waiting for. For input on that. Okay. Because there's, there's not documentation on how I mean, this has to do with the merge stuff, I think plus these change requests that were done. And there's not Yeah, we're finding documentation for stuff and it's

Unknown Speaker  23:31
confusing enough try to, to try to

Unknown Speaker  23:36
figure it out by trial and error

Speaker 3  23:38
on a contribution record for an SPE, find a school that was donated to So, so I'm trying to think I'm trying to understand which parts are confusing. Well, let me just set comments.

Speaker 1  23:59
And clarifying that clarification now that this that that business application is the SPE business application that might that might clear it up enough for him to get the linking done.

Unknown Speaker  24:15
Which parts are confusing? Are you familiar

Unknown Speaker  24:21
with

Unknown Speaker  24:24
contribution record

Unknown Speaker  24:31
the pieces you need

Speaker 3  24:37
an SPE member who donates to a specific school on member SP member applicant, a a member application or an SPE member that donates to a specific school they At

Speaker 3  25:09
I'm gonna say member application member applications for SPE members that donate to a specific school contribution records for the SPE self

Speaker 3  25:36
an SPE application this now requires specifying linking to to a business application on the non SP side

Unknown Speaker  25:59
see below

Unknown Speaker  26:17
okay

Unknown Speaker  26:23
there you go does that help

Speaker 1  26:47
Okay, yeah that probably will help along with like I said this down here clarify yield because that's that's a new feature right? Yes, that

Unknown Speaker  26:59
is a new field. Yep.

Speaker 1  27:03
Yeah, that was really thrown me for a loop before where your explanation there so

Unknown Speaker  27:09
yeah, that makes sense. I think let me I wonder if I need to

Unknown Speaker  27:24
Okay, so I'm going to actually, I'm going to uncheck dev input needed even though the field needs to be renamed. We can rename it we'll do that before testing is complete. Please go ahead and test the rest of

Unknown Speaker  27:47
the job.

Speaker 3  27:50
And why don't you well bounce this to Austin to see if this helps him out No, I think they already have this thing for better for worse so I mean, it's better than the last version they had I know that so but we do want to keep pushing forward on it. And if need we Nicklaus might be available he's starting to do two hours a week for for faith builder so he may be available to help with questions on this stuff. Okay. So there's that one

Unknown Speaker  28:27
all right. And then the

Speaker 3  28:29
next one is needs okay needs work. This is the one that needs email generation and we did not meet the deadline client would like to create and send emails okay.

Unknown Speaker  29:07
Okay

Speaker 3  29:19
let's have Nikolas design this in his I guess this is right. We could also have been tempted to have Nicolas designed this. So he's got he's he needs to do a work study program. And so instead of mopping floors he's going to be working with what's his face? Justin? Two hours a week. Okay, nice. And unpaid.

Unknown Speaker  29:55
So

Speaker 3  29:57
So I'm wondering about having Nicolas actually just designed That's what Justin, we two things I like about that. Now Justin is waiting on his side of things. I mean, it's in Justin's court instead of at ours. And does that sound fair?

Speaker 1  30:12
It's probably the most efficient way to get it designed because they'll be able to discuss it in person and work on it together as they have time. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  30:23
So

Speaker 3  30:25
So can you just I'll let you all hand that off to him. Is that fair?

Speaker 1  30:30
Yeah. And which one is that again, the email generation the email

Speaker 3  30:34
generation one so I'd say emailing Nicholas and Justin and saying could you I mean, could this be could this be designed you know whatever. Could Nicholas work with you on design on this one?

Unknown Speaker  31:05
Okay

Speaker 3  31:07
next one is the school communications thing

Speaker 3  31:18
No, he sent an email about that when I got that my inbox here somewhere.

Speaker 1  31:26
Communications note. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  31:38
And he gave the three list options he's wanting. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  31:44
Yeah. So that one

Unknown Speaker  31:54
is the change request for that one?

Unknown Speaker  31:59
A 581. For communications notice 80 580 appear

Unknown Speaker  32:06
sure enough it's.

Unknown Speaker  32:18
So basically on that one.

Unknown Speaker  32:27
So

Speaker 1  32:30
three options. And are these? I haven't been following this super closely. Is this, these checkboxes or this drop list?

Speaker 3  32:44
This is a dropil. Well, let me find what this is. Pull up the test. Pull up test FB SP system. It's being updated by Austin as we speak. Okay, sure. I'll pull up the live FB system. It's something about communications or emails or something like that. I don't even it's on the SPE side. What is that?

Speaker 1  33:17
It's it's on the school though, isn't it?

Speaker 3  33:23
But we have an sp we have some kind of email slash communications record.

Speaker 1  33:28
I forget where it is. Oh, the actual record itself? Yeah. I'm looking at the record itself. So this is the notice of state approval received this one here?

Unknown Speaker  33:43
Can you go into settings here though? Because okay, this creates this, how can I call email templates? But where are the email templates configured to remember that that's what I'm looking for.

Speaker 1  33:58
The actual configure configure community.

Speaker 3  34:02
That's it. That's what I'm looking for. drill into any one of these. go into edit mode. It's an Edit Mode already. Level is contact. Okay, so there is no recipients here right now. Scroll down a bit more. I don't think Okay, so right now it's all those shung with options. We have the level thing. Contact member applications SPE applications. Oh, we're not using this for schools yet. How are schools being noted? Okay, but there is another that other jobs.

Unknown Speaker  34:45
Okay. Schools are context, right? Yes, they

Unknown Speaker  34:49
are now. Yeah.

Speaker 3  34:51
I think we've got specific I think we've got specific email All exports when it comes email export are they talking about here?

Unknown Speaker  35:05
The in this job was

Unknown Speaker  35:08
was this notice a state approval received

Unknown Speaker  35:11
this one here?

Unknown Speaker  35:16
Okay, well that is a communication definition. Oh it goes to the contact, but how does it know which contacts to go to?

Unknown Speaker  35:27
Oh,

Speaker 3  35:29
I bet that is actually hard coded evaluate template from email record notification of state approval received okay. Let me do some sleuthing on my side this is kind of down the dev level now notification

Unknown Speaker  36:21
okay, then let me try something else

Unknown Speaker  36:26
go into the

Speaker 3  36:30
Okay. So, go over to the the x 30 that you had there settings I forget which tab that was right here. Okay. Just a second. Let me take a look at this one. This is doing a input file for column recipient call context group. What is the what are the asks? Go into Advanced tab right there Yep, sorry, advanced standard. Okay, as prompt for group or we have a prompt for group. Okay, so go into as prompts. Prompt for group is a checkbox prompt for group A V contact group is okay. Click on the contact groups. option under contact groups. Listening over the listening column right there yep, and then hit Alt G Yep, there we go. Alt G again. Okay, and then click on the list name itself there that'll take us into the list. Okay, so this is in the contact groups we need to all schools into multiple options and that's what I was after this whole time. Okay, so let me just I'm gonna Okay

Unknown Speaker  37:56
for

Unknown Speaker  37:58
school communication

Speaker 3  38:07
Okay, I'm gonna do it in my style and then you can reformat it and we currently and you can reformat that however you want to then we we for the requirements we currently have a school option for a contact group for communication for communications

Speaker 3  38:35
let's change this to three options Okay, and he said he wants the three options to be

Unknown Speaker  38:56
that was June

Speaker 3  39:00
Do you have the three here just send it to me on in this meeting chats or or signal it's not wanting

Unknown Speaker  39:14
there it isn't meeting chat

Unknown Speaker  39:21
Okay, and it will be

Speaker 3  39:31
and all will be listed first because these are alphabetical

Speaker 3  39:40
and I'm going to say it should be all common including preschools. And SP SPE eligible Shouldn't that be hyphenated? Where's Nicholas? What I need him from my grammar.

Unknown Speaker  40:01
Yeah, rob the

Speaker 3  40:05
take a look at Mr. Washington. Do you wanna get look at my last names and tell me what Nicholas would have told me? Have you only been here? These are three options in a drop list. Would you hyphenate SP eligible? I think and what you capitalize non for non SP okay. And probably if it's all this is really a parenthetical parenthetical? Is it do to calm or hyphen

Unknown Speaker  40:44
Yep, okay, perfect.

Unknown Speaker  40:47
Right well I passed the test okay so there we go

Speaker 3  41:05
so I think that is well I can go ahead I'm gonna go ahead and approve it from my side and except you probably want to have an estimate on what this change is going to take won't you?

Unknown Speaker  41:23
If Yeah, it's gonna be a paid job it'd be nice to have

Unknown Speaker  41:26
Yeah, um, well

Speaker 3  41:31
I can just a second let me see if I can quickly see what contact groups are okay

Unknown Speaker  41:48
perhaps

Speaker 3  41:55
contact Groups list let me find references to this email contact group on the oh this is on the email record. Okay, let me find references to that

Unknown Speaker  42:55
pain for yikes

Speaker 3  43:01
Yes, it's not simple email contact equals

Unknown Speaker  43:10
shoot. So

Speaker 3  43:17
okay, let me just add notes that the design is suddenly unapproved. I mean, the the client requirements are approved but the design spec is uncertain. Okay, let me just add so I'm going to start typing at the bottom

Unknown Speaker  43:36
Yeah, I'm not editing it. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  43:38
We have new

Unknown Speaker  43:52
Okay.

Speaker 3  43:54
fbU would like the option to send emails to SP eligible schools or non SPE schools, which are kindergartens are both are two ways to do this

Speaker 3  44:24
create a new or use a new contact type for an honest for kindergarten or times this seems risky. Well it's pretty invasive.

Speaker 3  44:58
Split the let me restate that split. The School contact type into two distinct types

Unknown Speaker  45:12
find all references

Unknown Speaker  45:18
contact

Unknown Speaker  45:21
I've seen consider

Unknown Speaker  45:26
whether

Unknown Speaker  45:28
change also would need to change the

Speaker 3  45:44
okay so okay so that's this thing here and um email customer that was that that was the one

Unknown Speaker  46:01
and contact groups

Unknown Speaker  46:05
oh right which is just a standard list

Speaker 3  46:17
see contact groups, email contacts and email customer import so is it okay so that's option one

Unknown Speaker  46:34
okay the other way to do it that's actually now that's a better solution okay

Speaker 3  46:47
if you want me to share my screen so that you're not bored listening to me talk then I can or I can just you can just be bored Which do you want

Speaker 1  46:57
I'm not bored I'm working on other stuff here. Okay. Yeah

Unknown Speaker  47:04
you can keep going I'll have this ready for you in a bit

Speaker 1  47:08
Okay excellent. You drop briefly here we'll be right back Yep. That's

Unknown Speaker  47:25
it Are you the hostess see the host Oh, I

Unknown Speaker  48:09
think he's the host

Speaker 3  48:12
I won't do screen sharing and he hasn't enable it for me yet. Okay. Steph Yes.

Unknown Speaker  49:04
Which way to go

Unknown Speaker  49:37
check this

Unknown Speaker  49:49
out That one's fine?

Speaker 3  52:28
Okay I think we're going down the right yeah I think my design was headed the right direction

Unknown Speaker  53:12
options for

Unknown Speaker  53:59
medications that

Speaker 3  54:13
okay take a look at that see if the how that spec looks

Unknown Speaker  54:23
all right

Speaker 4  54:35
all right So, communication notice in SP schools school option for contact group on communication records for schools client is officially known as Pe communications that prompt for contacts if school is selected for record will show Additional high

Unknown Speaker  55:13
school

Unknown Speaker  55:16
so this would be on the on the Configure communication

Speaker 3  55:19
no not on the Configure this is over on the like if you choose the notice of state approval if you choose

Speaker 1  55:32
I guess when here yeah so when you actually go to send it

Speaker 3  55:37
yeah then if you prompt for a contact group okay schools and then there'll be an option for school like

Speaker 1  55:55
wait a minute this is so when I click on notice of state of approval received it shows soliciting applications up here that's about going around one there but okay so schools and then

Speaker 4  56:21
showing additional with the options all including SP eligible

Speaker 3  56:28
Wait a second that's a multi select thing that goes to schools we don't have we can't have a required thing driven off of multiselect now so that's a problem given let me take a look at the list of types that we have here

Speaker 3  57:10
I mean, I guess i Okay i can't i can't conditionally show it what I could do one of two things

Unknown Speaker  57:20
I'm the

Speaker 3  57:27
I wonder how many of these are actually

Unknown Speaker  57:37
sent to schools or where

Unknown Speaker  57:45
yeah

Unknown Speaker  57:49
let me let me find his what was his email subject

Unknown Speaker  57:57
that one should be communications note

Speaker 3  58:16
okay I archive that went let me find it here

Unknown Speaker  58:33
there we go

Unknown Speaker  59:14
okay

Speaker 3  59:18
Justin, we're working on details for design here which communication?

Speaker 3  59:53
The list of contact groups are these communication It is actually driven from the same list that we use on the contact record

Speaker 3  1:00:13
thinking of adding a separate drop list for school type with options for

Unknown Speaker  1:00:34
s p o Oh

Unknown Speaker  1:00:39
including preschool

Unknown Speaker  1:00:47
on sp

Unknown Speaker  1:00:49
sp eligible

Unknown Speaker  1:00:57
each of the

Speaker 3  1:01:08
menu items are coded separately which of these need options to only send to free schools or the only sent to an SPE or only to SP Okay?

Unknown Speaker  1:02:09
Think a bunch of these should never go to schools

Speaker 3  1:02:19
and actually, I guess we could just check do these all

Speaker 3  1:02:41
Okay, so those are two that prompt the notice of state approval? Do you wanna make a note that we should change that title? That's just wrong. The title is just wrong.

Unknown Speaker  1:02:58
On this one

Speaker 3  1:03:00
other notices state approval. Yeah, it should it should just be the title should be noticed the state approval received instead of soliciting? I think I mean, I guess unless we want to ask them but yeah, and just write it up market approved on both sides and assign it to Jonathan an email him he can do it sometime.

Speaker 1  1:03:20
Okay. Ben Darren didn't write that one up. Unless you're working on something else there. Yeah, it's

Unknown Speaker  1:03:24
a very simple one to do.

Speaker 2  1:03:27
Sorry, I was replying to a CWA a you know really quick, which we needed to do.

Speaker 1  1:03:35
So here in the city SFB. On the SPE side, when you go to when you select the notice of state approval received here, under communications, the heading here says applications, which is the which is the one for this one. So they're they're just duplicates, they actually have the same prompts. So it looks like they just duplicated them without updating the name here.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:07
Gotcha. Other prompts supposed to be the thing

Speaker 1  1:04:11
for now? Yeah. So it's just changing that that changing the title. So you can just write up a change request and mark it approved vendor and client and and send it out and as Jonathan to take care of it at

Speaker 3  1:04:27
his leisure? Yeah, it's not it's no rush. And in the in the dev spec, you can say just for LS, just change the title specified in the x 30. itself.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:49
Okay,

Speaker 3  1:05:12
We had concerns okay we had considered splitting

Unknown Speaker  1:05:20
school

Speaker 3  1:05:24
contact type into two options that will affect every single part of our system that deals with schools it's probably about 10x cost

Unknown Speaker  1:06:45
okay

Speaker 3  1:06:47
okay, so I sent another email on that one so it's I think it's back to me I'm sure he's he's faster on emails than I am so he'll probably reply fairly soon so I think that kind of clears up a lot of the

Unknown Speaker  1:07:04
yes

Speaker 1  1:07:08
I just I just sent over another x FB one the county bug one that's ready for your approval

Unknown Speaker  1:07:15
okay that should okay

Speaker 1  1:07:25
that's should pretty much take care of them I can review it here quickly check

Unknown Speaker  1:08:03
the county one is a top priority isn't it?

Speaker 1  1:08:08
Yes, I mean they have a workaround for that one as well you do okay. Okay. Let's see here fine find that can confirm that when well they can they can make it work yeah, because they can go in and change the county on the primary contact to match what what it should but sure yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:39
So pretty annoying

Speaker 3  1:08:47
I had not realized that the primary contacts are only used for email basically and not for print mail. I mean, it sounds like that's how everything works but but I would not have been able to guess that

Unknown Speaker  1:09:20
see, you approved that one already? Yeah, I'm just

Unknown Speaker  1:09:24
trying to decide who I'm gonna have to do this

Unknown Speaker  1:09:46
I love that Nick do it for loading him up too much or not?

Speaker 3  1:10:03
because it's gonna be a fair bit of explaining for Jonathan for this time I think I'd like to avoid Jonathan let me just send an email to Nicholas and well, now let me just text him

Unknown Speaker  1:10:33
and once

Speaker 2  1:10:35
the CWA just approved the Venn duplication thing, is that ready to be coded that?

Speaker 1  1:10:42
Yeah, that was his approval, then, which I think it does already. Yeah. Then you can just send out an email. Okay, yeah. You can just send out the email to the internal reply to the internal conversation good.

Speaker 3  1:11:25
