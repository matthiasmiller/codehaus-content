Unknown Speaker  01:21
Again, Hello, you. Again. You.

Unknown Speaker  01:44
Hey guys, you

Unknown Speaker  02:17
any brilliant Insights

Unknown Speaker  02:19
since we last stop. No, sorry,

Speaker 1  02:29
I did go to the state websites for filing these and Indiana is pretty clear bad debt adjustments would be reported separately. Otherwise you would just put it into current sales. So if we have a new invoice date, you know, because of, you know, a cancelation, or whatever, you know, if we have a sales, something to show that sales affected, it's just current sales. Virginia, North Carolina, also are including adjustments, and like, all adjustments in current sales, so, like, they don't have a separate place to write off bad debt or anything like that. Ohio says that they have a line for credits from the previous period. So if you're claiming a credit and you're claiming you paid too much for the previous period, then that's what you put in there. So it wouldn't necessarily be all adjustments from previous periods, but I would guess, if we, you know, bad basically, just treat this like the bad debt thing. If it's bad debt, we put it in there. If it's not, it's then a current sale, and it's not a previous sale, you know.

Matthias Miller  04:02
So skip the other adjustments.

Speaker 1  04:05
That's, yeah, the New York website was having fits and wouldn't let me get in very well. So so I think we can just do bad debt adjustments and then everything else just rolls into current sales.

Speaker 2  04:23
Are these the only states where we have nexus, like, don't know we Pennsylvania, South Carolina. Do you file taxes for anything?

Speaker 1  04:32
No. I mean, they're never on a report. Now, whether we should be filing zeros or, I don't know where the vendor account. You know if they have a vendor account in PA or in South Carolina or whatever, then we should be filing zeros if

Speaker 2  04:51
we don't have any reported for it. And you're getting this information from what we need used to you,

Speaker 1  04:56
yeah, well, and from the. Yeah, you know, it's just where the places are that are on the reports.

Speaker 2  05:05
So, oh, on the sales tax report. Got it.

Speaker 1  05:12
I have wandered already. Sometimes there are, it's like an Ohio building and it has an Indiana like, how does that work? Can affordable sell a building in Indiana, or is that automatically going to be a shed time sale? No, they can. But so then, like, affordable should be filing in Indiana. Then, you know, and shed time could possibly file in Iowa. But there's like, I mean, the ones that I saw the most were,

Unknown Speaker  05:53
what were they? I

Speaker 1  05:56
forget which way it was, but they just got rolled into, you know, if it was affordable, it got rolled into Ohio sales, so that probably should be looked into a little bit,

Unknown Speaker  06:07
but probably not something Well,

Unknown Speaker  06:11
I mean, for this design,

Unknown Speaker  06:13
no,

Speaker 1  06:15
because, I mean, the only thing that would have to do with this design would be no because all the states are there when you select for report. So if you decide that, oh, we're going to start selling in in Indiana, you know, or start you need to collect sales tax in Indiana for affordable then you just It should all be there

Speaker 2  06:37
well. But I think there's something with tax jars set up where you have to have if you have nexus in a state. I'm thinking that's probably something we should ask with Josh. And I'm wondering if states where we don't have nexus, if he's just defaulting to the Ohio rate or the Indiana rate. I my business. But, yeah, I don't think so. Were we ready to Okay? So we do have some examples or my jumping ahead here and you, you sent this to Matthias, right? Yeah, it's

Unknown Speaker  07:27
on that, sure, real bitch.

Unknown Speaker  07:34
So this is,

Unknown Speaker  07:41
is the old one? No,

Speaker 1  07:42
I just added it. Oh, I'm here down, got

Unknown Speaker  07:46
it so,

Speaker 2  07:51
but go ahead, drew you can you can explain what we have here. Well,

Speaker 1  07:54
so these are just different situations. So that's not wrapping very well. Where is that? Oh, there

Speaker 3  08:09
we go. That's that. It's this scary. No, this guy. Oh, yeah,

Speaker 1  08:18
I lose. Of all the symbols on these things, anyway, so tax rates increasing upon invoicing customer short pays using original sales tax amount company covers the difference putting it to bad debt expense there just shows the change, and then we have, here's what? There's payment discrepancy. We need more space here that's

Speaker 3  09:01
just the difference between delivery office and Google. Um,

Speaker 1  09:12
so then this is then on the right, we just have the accounting that happens, but column L, there is what AR would do. I You,

Speaker 3  09:20
so

Speaker 1  09:24
I don't know, Mark, were you thinking that's like a button they would click, or a process that they that we call resolving the tax discrepancy, which means they do this, this and this, I was thinking

Speaker 2  09:37
a button that they would click, since it's it seems to be pretty consistent on and I like your idea of so one, your idea of adding payment methods that are so Matthias, we talked about adding additional payment methods to handle these situations. But the concern is that it becomes we add too many payment methods, and it becomes difficult for users to know which to use. So it could we create payment methods that are conditional, based on on conditions, like, obviously, the the resolve tax discrepancy would be, you would only see that button if, or what would like the criteria would be, you can only see it if you have a tax rate chain

Speaker 1  10:36
I did up at the top. I think I have them straight. I put them in here that you know, if we're using this payment method situation or to resolve these things, then, if the invoice has, if the invoice has no change to the subtotal. But a change to the tax, then we'd have these two payment methods available in the drop down, which would be sales tax refund to customer, or then sales tax adjustment, which would if you know, depending if it's positive or negative, it would write one, and if it's if it's positive, would write one. If it's negative, it'd write a different one. Maybe that would be two, for example, no, well, it's up at the top of this Google page. Like it goes up a little bit. Oh, 20302030,

Matthias Miller  11:41
there. No change.

Speaker 1  11:47
So no change to the subtotal, but it changed to the tax. So these two payment methods would be all applied to sales tax change situations such as if went from taxable non taxable, if the tax rate changed because of location or because of date, then these payment methods would handle it, and they would only be in your drop down menu for payment methods if you have this case in your you know, if you have that case of no subtotal change, but a tax amount change in your invoice, and then if there's a change to both subtotal and tax, these two, we already have adjustment for customer overpayment, underpayment, and then refund to customer would be if it's that situation where you want, you know too much was charged, and you want to send it back, but it splits. These here are all a split of part of the accounting transaction goes to accrued liabilities, and part of it goes to sales. Then no change to the thing would just be, you know, the guy just plain paid too much and you want to give him some money back. Was what that overpayment refund would be, or just this regular one would also work. So these two are actually the same. The same thing should happen in both but the refunds would be slightly different if I haven't corrected my mind anyway. So

Speaker 2  13:24
why couldn't the refund to customer an overpayment refund to customer

Unknown Speaker  13:31
that couldn't be the same one the

Unknown Speaker  13:35
under the hood hit,

Unknown Speaker  13:38
um, what

Unknown Speaker  13:40
was I thinking? It's

Unknown Speaker  13:45
Oh, the refund,

Speaker 1  13:49
refund to custom, there was a change so that affected the difference in AR. So there's no ar to give back, um, whereas the second one AR was still down,

Unknown Speaker  14:03
you know, like

Speaker 1  14:06
the original invoice amount is $5,000 so there's no change. He just gave us an extra $5 if we want to send it back, we need to go to AR with that to correct AR,

Unknown Speaker  14:21
yeah. Whereas the other one only $480 is due in AR, and so now we need to, well,

Unknown Speaker  14:36
seems complicated back

Unknown Speaker  14:37
that's not in AR, but he paid it anyway.

Unknown Speaker  14:58
So I.

Matthias Miller  15:01
Uh, it seems to me like maybe just be maybe watching for changes to subtotal and tax both. Seems complicated. It seems like we should be able to do, do it all based on how much did the tax change. And so if you and this is really it's actually more more nuanced than This tax increase decreased less than overpayment or less. I

Matthias Miller  16:13
Okay, so if the customer overpaid here, let's do this actually, let's make these tangibles. So we're going to

Matthias Miller  16:32
existing spreadsheet right here. Me. Okay, never mind then don't so, so we're going to Say

Unknown Speaker  16:44
tax

Matthias Miller  16:49
here we're going to do, let's

Unknown Speaker  16:53
sorry I'm

Unknown Speaker  17:03
subtotal,

Matthias Miller  17:08
original tax, new tax, so we have a $5,000 invoice, and we started with a $500 tax, and the new tax is 250

Unknown Speaker  17:24
tax change

Matthias Miller  17:28
is minus 250 and then payments equals, okay, so I don't know, I kind of like this matrix, because it kind of helped.

Matthias Miller  17:55
Let me try this overpayment,

Speaker 3  17:59
payment, discrepancy, tax discrepancy We have. Let's try this. This might actually work. Um,

Unknown Speaker  18:52
all right, so

Matthias Miller  18:56
customer, overpaid, I

Matthias Miller  19:06
and then let's do this.

Unknown Speaker  19:21
Yes,

Matthias Miller  19:26
and then this is

Matthias Miller  19:38
oops. I meant to accept it. But anyway, all right. So here we have a scenario. Customer overpaid by $500 tax increase by $500

Unknown Speaker  19:53
nothing needed.

Matthias Miller  19:58
Somehow they magically knew the tax. Rate was going to go up. Customer overpaid by $500 tax decreased by $500 so we need to either refund $501,000

Unknown Speaker  20:19
or

Matthias Miller  20:21
pay state extra $500 and these are, obviously, that's an extreme example, but

Speaker 4  20:30
am I right up? You either refund 1000 or you pay state extra 500 and refund 500 right?

Matthias Miller  20:39
Well or not and refund, slash, write off $500 I mean, the extra zero makes it look like, yeah, we're thieves. But is that? Is this scenario right

Speaker 1  21:01
in the discrepancy is the payment is more than balance due and tax discrepancy is more than tax Well, in this case, less than the tax amount, right? It's not difference between the two,

Matthias Miller  21:19
right? The here, we could say it like this.

Matthias Miller  21:32
This is tax change. Oh so Oh, here, I think my Hang on. Sorry, I have a tamales delivery right here. I'll be right back.

Unknown Speaker  21:52
Nice, deliver or something, tamales.

Unknown Speaker  22:01
That's like a

Speaker 4  22:03
Mexican they're good. I'm trying to remember exactly what they are.

Speaker 4  22:12
Yeah, it's the ones they're in, like a what's a dough with meat inside, and then they're wrapped in corn husk or banana leaves. But you don't eat the corn house because that's just how they're packaged. They're good. I hadn't just eaten lunch. I would be jealous and hungry, but I'm currently full and satisfied. So

Speaker 2  22:36
do you also miss the food from Bangladesh or,

Speaker 4  22:39
Oh yeah, for sure, I mom makes it every week or two. So if now that I'm back at home, I have it more often than I did when I was at Faith builders. But yeah,

Speaker 2  22:54
I know your dad told me there was one of the dishes that he really likes. I forget what? Oh, boy, yeah. Yeah. I think there was, is it rice and goat? Goat meat?

Speaker 4  23:06
Oh, okay, that's one of the reasonable ones he likes. Yeah, he has some unreasonable ones he likes, too.

Unknown Speaker  23:17
Like, what, um,

Speaker 4  23:19
they have, it's fish stuff. One is just dried fish that's terribly strong, so they dry it, and then they mash it up with lots of spices, and you eat it with your rice just a little bit. It doesn't take much to flavor it. Or they have another fish one. So the first one is Shuki, and then they have Chapa Shuki, which they take fish, chop it up into fairly small pieces, put it in a pot with water and spices, bury it underground for two weeks to let it age, and then they make a similar pace out of that. And that is the fishiest smelling or tasting stuff you've ever had. So he somehow likes that. The rest of us ask him to leave the house when he eats it. It's so bad.

Matthias Miller  24:09
That was my farewell meal when I when my last my farewell meal, farewell meal at the office. Did you request it? No, it was one of those. You know, you only live once. You have to at least experience this

Speaker 4  24:21
guy with you. I thought you'd had that earlier in the time and have something better and more soothing as the farewell meal.

Unknown Speaker  24:39
But

Unknown Speaker  24:41
before you usually

Matthias Miller  24:45
or you have been working. Oh, this. This was when I was in Bangladesh. I was in Bangladesh for about a year.

Speaker 2  24:50
Oh, okay. Oh, you mean that, that the last meal Seth just described? Yeah,

Matthias Miller  24:57
right, that. Yes.

Matthias Miller  25:11
You raise a good question, the customer overpayment of, I think of the original Well, no, except I don't think, I don't know that it matters. We just need to know which one we mean, is it the new subtotal?

Speaker 2  25:37
Yeah. I mean, it would have to be the new subtotal, because, yeah, that's what we're so. So in one we're saying the customer overpaid by 500 on top of a

Matthias Miller  25:52
500 so Okay, so tax on that 500 so here, this is really re refund or write off $500

Unknown Speaker  26:11
no right

Unknown Speaker  26:13
four

Unknown Speaker  26:15
because, you know, on the top one, isn't it?

Speaker 1  26:19
Right? He overpaid by $500 of what it oh, $500 on top of the $500 ink. So he actually overpaid. In his mind, he was overpaying $1,000 right? He didn't know about the $500 Okay, yeah, I got it.

Unknown Speaker  26:40
So

Matthias Miller  26:46
all right, so then the outcome, or the action would be here. Let's just put this little space there. All right. So then so increased customer overpaid. So thought they overpaid $1,000 um, refund to write off the $500

Unknown Speaker  27:10
then

Matthias Miller  27:14
tax decreased by $500 customers still overpaid by $500 and It's still refunded right off the $500

Unknown Speaker  27:33
so okay, it

Speaker 2  27:42
it would be, I think it would be helpful to understand, to help me, at least to help me understand if we would have, if we could put subtotals, could we add a column with subtotal and, well, maybe That wouldn't do that much

Matthias Miller  28:00
good here, at least. I we could do a, let's do a. Well, okay, let's start with this. Oh, I have a subtotal

Unknown Speaker  28:13
and a payment amount,

Matthias Miller  28:17
and then we have a original total, then we'll have the tax change here.

Matthias Miller  28:33
So this is this plus.

Unknown Speaker  28:39
Now it's this.

Matthias Miller  28:44
No tax went up. Original total was,

Speaker 4  28:52
don't you want an original tax too? Yeah, because tax is on top of the subtotal.

Matthias Miller  29:01
So let's do like a $10,000 building, and

Matthias Miller  29:14
we'll do $750 of tax on it, and then the original total is this plus oops, equals this plus

Unknown Speaker  29:25
this.

Matthias Miller  29:30
And then tax increased, and then we have a new tax, which is this plus this, and then we have a new total,

Unknown Speaker  29:52
which is this plus this.

Matthias Miller  30:00
And then we have a

Unknown Speaker  30:04
did you put a payment amount? Yeah,

Matthias Miller  30:10
payment amount, which would be the original total. Plus, are we doing the original or the it doesn't really matter. But anyway,

Speaker 2  30:21
so you're doing now, you're doing the original total plus your payment discrepancy, right? It doesn't

Matthias Miller  30:29
really matter. Which one we do is it? Do we want to do it off the No, I think we want it off the original, because the discrepancy is based off of the original one. The tax change is based off the original, and let's do this off the original as well.

Unknown Speaker  30:51
So the 11, 250 you're getting that from

Speaker 3  30:57
this plus the new tax, excuse me, no,

Speaker 4  31:01
you're getting it. Aren't you getting it from the original total, plus the discrepancy

Speaker 2  31:09
it, yeah, the original for

Unknown Speaker  31:12
the payment amount.

Matthias Miller  31:14
Oh, the payment amount, the payment amount. Oh, yeah, sorry, I was answering the wrong question.

Speaker 1  31:31
So, so that is correct during the first line, then there's no nothing to do, because he he thought he was overpaying $500 but The tax actually went up, so he was not right.

Matthias Miller  32:05
This makes it really clear,

Unknown Speaker  32:11
nothing All right, chances

Speaker 2  32:13
of that happened would be, but yeah, but it's yeah, it's good or scenarios. All right.

Matthias Miller  32:30
So then it was 10, 750, the customer overpaid by $500 so here, this is the refund, slash, write off $500

Unknown Speaker  32:50
and

Matthias Miller  32:54
refund, slash,

Matthias Miller  33:02
pay state $500

Speaker 2  33:08
why are you paying state? If Didn't your tax decrease? Oh, you're right. Wouldn't you refund the full amount here? Refund or write off the full amount?

Matthias Miller  33:23
Yes, you're right.

Speaker 1  33:29
I mean, you could pay it to the state, but in this case, would be pretty ridiculous.

Matthias Miller  33:40
Okay, so then here the tax. That's the tax increased $250

Matthias Miller  33:49
so we can either pay new tax out of pocket

Unknown Speaker  33:57
or collect from customer

Unknown Speaker  34:07
and the customer, in this case, the customer tax increase 250 the customer overpaid by 500

Matthias Miller  34:19
Oh, never mind. Sorry, still not true. Going,

Speaker 4  34:25
don't you either refund them 250 or write off

Unknown Speaker  34:30
that's right,

Matthias Miller  34:33
because they paid for the new tax and then some

Speaker 2  34:36
they paid for the new tax because of their increase, because they overpaid 500

Unknown Speaker  34:43
Correct, yeah, okay,

Matthias Miller  34:48
so then tax decreased by 250 and they overpaid. Here's where we get into this issue. They over ended up they thought they were overpaying 500 They actually were paid 750 so here then we need to either refund, slash, pay state,

Speaker 4  35:09
250 No, you still don't want to pay the state if the tax decreases.

Unknown Speaker  35:15
I'm so sorry.

Matthias Miller  35:18
You're right. Still

Unknown Speaker  35:19
a refund to write off the whole thing.

Matthias Miller  35:23
Yeah, okay. Now here the tax goes up.

Unknown Speaker  35:31
And he didn't overpay enough.

Matthias Miller  35:34
He didn't overpay enough. So then here we write off slash, collect 250 here, let's do collect, slash, write off, since that's the order we're using everywhere, right?

Matthias Miller  35:55
So then tax goes down again, and we still this time, tax went down more than what he originally overpaid, but he still ended up,

Unknown Speaker  36:11
wait a minute,

Speaker 4  36:14
it's the same one as two rows above. It's just the tax changes more, but his overpayment is less. So it's the same answer,

Matthias Miller  36:33
right? And then we'll get to more scenarios where they

Unknown Speaker  36:40
underpay. 5500, I 100,

Matthias Miller  36:43
right? It's just swapping, right. Okay, so then tax went up. They underpaid. And then here we can either, okay, tax went tax went up, so we gotta figure out if we're gonna collect or write it off and we owe the tax. Tax went down. He underpaid. Well, Whoopty, doo. Lucky for him. Tax went up. Anytime the tax goes up, we just collect. We have to either,

Unknown Speaker  37:28
well, there,

Speaker 1  37:30
there is a nuance there, like for the one where we collect to write off 1000 the first one, if, like, there's two different things that happen here, because we only, we only pay into the State 500 of this 1000,

Unknown Speaker  37:54
right? So

Speaker 1  37:58
our liability is they as $500 to take care of. We're not. We're not writing this all like say we write this off. We're not writing all $1,000 off in the same way. I don't think

Matthias Miller  38:13
that's that is correct. So this one here would be so in a tax increase. We're so here we would pay state 250 I mean, we could get more nuanced here, refund. This is not really a write off. This is a because the tax increase refund or pay state, right? And then here it increased, so we need to

Unknown Speaker  38:51
collect,

Matthias Miller  38:53
collect 250,

Unknown Speaker  38:59
or

Matthias Miller  39:01
pay state $500

Unknown Speaker  39:09
well, it's always pay state 500

Unknown Speaker  39:14
Right? Not everybody.

Unknown Speaker  39:17
Well, no,

Speaker 4  39:19
because the tax went up 500 he didn't pay enough to cover that,

Unknown Speaker  39:27
right? So it's either write off or collect it.

Speaker 4  39:31
It's paid state 500 and then write off or collect the 250

Matthias Miller  39:36
Well, if we if the tax decreased, though, like in this case, we would have the option of paying 750 to the state.

Speaker 2  39:55
In that situation if we either have to return the money or. The 750 to him, or either return the money or pay it to the state, because it was paid to us as sales tax, we can't, we can't keep it

Matthias Miller  40:18
right, and because it's a sorry, I was just

Speaker 4  40:21
wondering. Do you want some examples where only one of them changes to that help clarify things a little or not? It might

Speaker 1  40:37
well, are we getting do we want to put our response to the customer and our response to the state, two different columns. I

Unknown Speaker  40:51
think that would help.

Matthias Miller  40:56
But we've got multiple options.

Unknown Speaker  40:58
Yeah,

Matthias Miller  41:01
so I think here, let's do so, all right, I'm going to move these over. So nothing, still nothing. Here we can say, Pay extra 250 original tax. Drop, pay extra $500 to state, plus refund, slash, write off 500

Unknown Speaker  41:31
or

Matthias Miller  41:34
refund 1000

Unknown Speaker  41:38
Well, it's really,

Matthias Miller  41:41
oh, I see, yeah. No, it's really this and refund, slash, write off $500 so tax decreased by $500 we could pay that $500 to the state. And no, it's, let me make this clear, or refund $500 to customer, yeah, and then refund and write off the last Yes. All right, so then here, anytime you have a tax decrease,

Matthias Miller  42:21
I mean, this is the same thing, tax decree. This is 250

Matthias Miller  42:34
I think, by the way, this would be easier if we would sort first by tax changes and then by because tax changes is really the big Okay, so we search first by tax change, and then let's do by

Unknown Speaker  43:01
payment.

Matthias Miller  43:09
Column, I, J,

Matthias Miller  43:21
okay, so tax decrease in the underpaid. So this is again, nothing. Now tax decreased $500 and they underpaid 250

Matthias Miller  43:42
so they overpaid.

Unknown Speaker  43:51
And

Matthias Miller  44:00
so because the tax dropped, we have to have to have to do so.

Matthias Miller  44:12
The customer thought they underpaid, then they ended up overpaying. I

Speaker 1  44:29
uh, well, if the tax, if, if the tax drops, but they've paid in the tax, we can do nothing, because that's thinking. We have already filed on and paid in on that original amount. The customer paid in that original amount, yeah, it turns out he overpaid. But we we've already paid it in. We can do we can just leave it you. Do nothing.

Matthias Miller  45:01
Okay, the customer thought they owed 10, 750

Matthias Miller  45:09
we said, No, you only own 10, 250 they paid 10, 500 i

Unknown Speaker  45:32
I'm liking one of these at a time for a little bit.

Matthias Miller  45:38
Okay, well, let's, let's, let's, let's do, let's stop jumping around this one here, we're clear. Tax changed. Customer thought they underpaid. The customer didn't actually pay the right amount. They should go buy a lottery ticket. Nothing to do. All right, here's the next one. Tax dropped by $500 they thought they were underpaying by $250 because tax decreased, they actually ended up overpaying $250 i

Unknown Speaker  46:27
we need to, but we

Matthias Miller  46:31
does that $250 go to The state or get refunded? Well, obviously,

Unknown Speaker  46:39
we build that was

Matthias Miller  46:43
they thought it was tax, right?

Speaker 2  46:47
Well, either, either we refund it to the customer, or we just keep it like 50 to the state, because, right, we're not, it wasn't collected as being sales tax like we didn't.

Matthias Miller  47:09
Well, was it they paid? They thought

Speaker 1  47:15
you're right. Dollar should go to the to the state, because no way, no this, Okay, nevermind.

Matthias Miller  47:32
They paid. They thought, okay, the original total was, was 10,000 they thought they were paying 500 $500 to sales tax. Then we said your new balance is 10 250 so only 250 of that went to sales tax. Should we give either send that 250 to the state, because that's what they thought they were paying towards, even if they underpaid.

Speaker 2  48:08
Yeah, because either we have to, well listen, we either have to send it back to the state or the customer. We can't keep that 250 Mm, hmm.

Speaker 2  48:25
But then drew, are you what we do with the Okay, how much did the customer overpay? No, the customer underpaid.

Matthias Miller  48:31
They thought they were underpaying 250 because of the tax change. They actually overpaid 250

Speaker 2  48:42
Yeah. Yeah, like you have it there. I think is, is the only two options we have, right?

Matthias Miller  48:52
I think so. Customers thought they were paying it towards tax, even if they under thought they were underpaying initially. They thought it was going to tax. I

Speaker 1  49:04
uh, but what I don't understand is the tax actually dropped in this case.

Speaker 1  49:17
So I mean, I'm saying, I'm assuming that we paid sales tax already on this Sure, so we paid $750 in why would we need to pay another 250

Unknown Speaker  49:33
Oh, well,

Matthias Miller  49:37
I mean, now We're back to some fundamental things about this spreadsheet.

Unknown Speaker  49:40
I mean,

Speaker 1  49:50
I guess that should be also clarified. Was it, did we pay? I mean, I guess are we assuming that we already? Filed on these or not, because that's going to make

Unknown Speaker  50:04
does that make a difference? Does it make it? Yeah, it does. Yeah. I think so.

Matthias Miller  50:13
Because they've got the

Speaker 2  50:15
that brings Well, or that really complicates this now, because now we're looking here. We're just looking at AR now we're

Matthias Miller  50:25
but they do, you know it doesn't I mean the pay extra 250 might mean we already paid it.

Speaker 4  50:34
Then you don't have the or option, because if you're if you already filed, you don't have the option of refunding 250 unless you can tell the state, oh, well, you could do an adjustment

Matthias Miller  50:45
to the threat.

Speaker 1  50:46
Yeah, right, right, that's what we're doing. So, so

Matthias Miller  50:53
Okay, let's do this extra 250 goes to state or extra 250 goes to customer, and what that means is, if it happened before filing, you pay less. If it happens after filing, you do a credit to get that money back. And the scenario is the same. I

Matthias Miller  51:31
does that make sense?

Speaker 2  51:40
I think it does. I think what we're getting, the whether we pay it to the state or not, is kind of, in some ways, kind of irrelevant, because we'll catch that on our reporting, on our sales tax reporting, what is it currently versus what have we paid?

Matthias Miller  52:00
Well, except the the subtotal, the we need to know, from a taxation standpoint, the sales order says that it's $250 of tax. But from a sales tax reporting standpoint, we need to know whether the it's a $250 or $750 liability. Do no

Speaker 2  52:27
from from a reporting standpoint, we just need to know, okay, we we know it's a $250 liability. What we need to know also is, have we paid? Have we already paid 750 to the state, or have we not paid anything at all? Have we paid 250

Speaker 1  52:54
Well, all of these first ones where the tax change is negative, if we assume that we have already filed on the $750 tax. Then all of these, we have the option to pay into the state. I mean, no, assuming we've already filed, we have already paid it into the state. So we can say, do nothing and just leave it the way it was because we paid the customers money in or we can give the customer a refund and claim it as, I mean, it's basically just a

Speaker 3  53:50
adjustment to sales, right?

Speaker 2  53:58
Well, yeah, an adjustment to sales or rate change.

Unknown Speaker  54:09
See, that's where we need to we would, we would refund, and it's 100 This is a refund that is 100% a tax we're giving your tax money back, and we're lowering our accrued liability account so

Unknown Speaker  54:43
right,

Matthias Miller  54:46
can we could we frame this as something like, can

Matthias Miller  54:56
we just say what is extra tax money and what is. Free For All. Do what you want.

Speaker 1  55:06
Extra tax money, as in, they extra tax money was paid like, right? It was extra. We passed it on. Yes,

Unknown Speaker  55:15
I'm here. I

Matthias Miller  55:27
i or i mean extra text tax

Unknown Speaker  55:32
received,

Matthias Miller  55:37
because what we really need to know is from the customers paying how much of this was for tax that was overpaid.

Matthias Miller  55:49
Because not every time the tax decreases does it result in an overpayment of taxes.

Speaker 1  55:56
Right? It might be a change to the invoice subtotal, and so therefore it's going to be lower,

Matthias Miller  56:01
could be any number of things. I mean, that's the other scenario we're not handling here, is subtotal changes, as

Unknown Speaker  56:11
if this wasn't complicated enough.

Unknown Speaker  56:14
Well, that's kind of why I was thinking you need to look At both.

Speaker 3  56:17
But, um, so Well, maybe you're right. I

Speaker 2  56:40
I wonder if it would be helpful to go through the examples we put together just real quick. I mean, these are really, really basic and not near as complicated, but they might help guide us in the right guidance in our next part of the discussion. What do you I mean? If we look at at that first one, we're just saying the tax rate increases upon invoicing customer short pace using original sales tax amount company covers the difference putting it event debt expends. You'll see there the two and a half is what changed the rate. And then, if you go over, you know the resulting over and op, those are the resulting transactions that happen. So we get a payment. We're still short $25 so we write that off to bad debt, you know, probably a month or two later,

Matthias Miller  58:02
right? Or no, in

Speaker 2  58:03
that situation, we wouldn't. We would just see it right away that, oh, there's a payment discrepancy. The Payment Discrepancies cost because of a tax rate change. So let's write it all. But we're not, yeah, because of the increase we're paying. Yeah, we already handled the increase in sales tax. Up in row, 1617, I believe where we a time of invoicing. We We increase sales and use tax by 400 instead of 350 i

Speaker 3  59:17
i think it's here. So

Speaker 2  59:20
the next example is just where it decreases. The customer overpays. The company pays the difference to the state, which is the most likely thing that's going to happen, because these changes are going to be, typically just quite minimal. And then the example right below that is where we refund to come the amount to the customer. And

Unknown Speaker  59:52
that's there's just

Speaker 2  59:55
a regular customer under Payment where we write it all as bad debt after filing. Now, if you look at that one. And that one requires a split transaction rose, 6978 71 where a portion of it, of that $75 using the tax rate needs to go,

Unknown Speaker  1:00:16
Yeah, to lower the tax or tax liability is now lower, right?

Unknown Speaker  1:00:25
And then forget, what? What is that? One

Matthias Miller  1:00:29
regular customer repayment, money refunded?

Unknown Speaker  1:00:32
Yeah, so it just goes back. Customer money not refunded. So if it's not refunded, well, same thing. We just, we just put it to bad debt. I mean, it's, it actually is a contra to that, but

Speaker 2  1:00:55
the the amounts that we're going to keep on overpayments are always going to be very minimal. So, yeah, so I don't

Unknown Speaker  1:01:05
know if that was so. So, I guess

Speaker 2  1:01:12
lead as I into a clear in a clear direction. Matthias, I think you have it all. You have a grasp on what where you want to go with this.

Matthias Miller  1:01:26
Well, I mean, I don't know if it's just a Thursday afternoon thing or if it's something else. It seems to me like this is more nuanced, because if you can have you have three variables, subtotal can rise or fall, tax can rise or fall, and you can have underpayment relative to the original, and all of those can be in differing amounts. And so you need to know when they wrote the check. Anytime there's an overpayment, okay, underpayment of final invoices always, always, always okay, like, that's just bad debt, and we don't care which they thought they were paying for one thing or something else. It's fine if they overpay the final invoice and tax dropped, then at least i The difference between the lesser of their overpayment and the tax drop needs to be handled as a sales tax refund.

Speaker 2  1:03:00
I realized we're at two already. We're good to go for a little bit. But if you guys need to drop

Matthias Miller  1:03:07
I can do another 1010. Or so. I shouldn't go too far past that. Okay, if the customer underpays final invoice amount,

Unknown Speaker  1:03:19
we don't care

Matthias Miller  1:03:23
about subtotal changes, tax changes. Well, we don't care about any any prior changes if the Customer overpays final invoice amount,

Matthias Miller  1:03:57
if the subtotal changes, I

Speaker 2  1:04:06
Well, I think the first question is, is, if they were paid, is, do we refund any money or not?

Unknown Speaker  1:04:20
I think

Matthias Miller  1:04:24
if the tax rate dropped, if the tax

Unknown Speaker  1:04:32
what happens,

Matthias Miller  1:04:37
if the tax line item drops, just straight up tax line item drops. At what point does that

Matthias Miller  1:04:55
okay if we issue an invoice and two things happen? One. They had a the dealer didn't put a discount on that they wanted to okay, we issued the initial invoice, then dealer adds a discount and the tax rate drops, and then they end up overpaying.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:20
Or am I just

Matthias Miller  1:05:23
overthinking it, or in that September, because

Speaker 1  1:05:27
in that case, you have both, you have a change to both. And so who's to know what they thought they were paying like they were just paying. And wouldn't that be, would it be okay, I guess, to just treat that situation just as if there was no tax rate change, but there was an adjustment to that invoice, so the subtitle change, so therefore the tax rate's going to change. So we just treat it like that,

Unknown Speaker  1:06:08
like we would all others.

Matthias Miller  1:06:11
That's That's a you question, compliance type question, not a me quit question, yeah, the most conservative approach is to say, take the lesser is basically min customer overpayment amount and tax decrease amount

Unknown Speaker  1:06:40
and

Matthias Miller  1:06:42
refund or pay to state.

Matthias Miller  1:06:50
So if they ever paid by 250 and tax dropped by 500 because of a rate change, then, well, all that whole 250 we can assume, conservatively, should go to the state who should be refunded because because of a tax rate change, if they were paid $500 in tax drops by 250 then we should assume that the 250 should be refunded or paid to the state, and we get To decide what to do With the other 250 you

Speaker 2  1:07:46
so, so why are we? Why would we ever pay the state more than we than the final invoice? It's only when it's not worth the hassle of refunding the money to the cost, right?

Speaker 1  1:08:05
No, the only time we would pay them more is it for a rate or the sale? No, no, I'm

Speaker 2  1:08:11
saying. I'm saying we, we get the final, final invoice, and we look at what the sales amount is, the sales taxes, and we, regardless of whether company or customer pays, why would we ever pay more than that dollar amount? I'm saying, the only time we were we are ever needing to pay more is if we see, yeah, you know what? These five bucks, it's not worth sending back to the customer, so we have to pay it to the state,

Speaker 1  1:08:45
not if it's your final and like if it's your final invoice, if you've paid the tax and they pay you extra, then that's like they've paid you according to the invoice. They pay you an additional $5 that additional $5 is your

Speaker 2  1:09:05
bonus tax or anything. Couldn't go up, couldn't we just always treat it like that? That would take out that one variable of like we in the end, we just paid the final on the very final invoice, whatever the sales tax is, we pay that, but we pay nothing more. And assuming tax rate drops and a customer legitimately, you know, let's say it drops $50 and they pay us in full, but $50 is extra because they thought it was $50 more. Well, either we we're either going to refund, we'll just refund that to the cost of always, and any of we don't, you know the few times where it's a couple cents. Does it really matter? Like,

Speaker 1  1:09:56
well, if our tax was cut, if the tax. Tax that we said that we collected on that thing, bringing the invoice was paid in. If they ever pay by three cents, there's nothing more to do. Just put it in your change drawer.

Matthias Miller  1:10:16
Well, we're issuing sales orders initially. With the tax if they pay off the sales order, that's not the invoice, as long as between the I don't know the technicalities of this, but the delivery guy is going to show up and he's going to ask them to pay. Is it a sales order at that point,

Speaker 2  1:10:40
yeah, because we don't invoice until after they're delivered, like the day after they're delivered in it. So we invoice

Matthias Miller  1:10:49
so, so realistically, this is a non issue. You'll invoice it. We'll update the tax rates, and that is the invoice.

Speaker 2  1:11:02
I think we're right now. We're just showing an estimated tax anyway. So if, if it does change, the only problem I consider if we, if they pay off the sales order $50 they pay us $50 more, and then the when we invoice, the rate drops, then we're keeping, if we would keep that money, we're keeping money that we portrayed to the customer, sales tax. But I think it's a non issue, because if it's any substantial amount, we'll refund at the customer, if it's a minimal amount of a couple cents, then, like you said,

Unknown Speaker  1:11:42
we'll just keep it.

Speaker 1  1:11:44
You're saying if, if the tax rate dropped, if

Speaker 2  1:11:48
the tax rate dropped, and because of that, they end up overpaying three or $5

Speaker 1  1:11:56
well, that would need to be paid in because it was collected as sales tax. Well, I'm just saying,

Speaker 2  1:12:06
if we would take that out of the equation, it would make this whole thing a lot easier.

Matthias Miller  1:12:17
Well, you just have an across the board policy that, I mean, we can detect tax rate drops. If it's if it's we'll write a one cent check to you. Or if it's stripe, a stripe refund would be it's pretty painless. So most of the time it's going into stripe and issuing a one penny refund. You can mail a check for that amount. That point you don't have to worry about, I mean,

Speaker 2  1:12:49
oh, you're just saying refund 100% of the time if it's because of that,

Unknown Speaker  1:12:53
right?

Speaker 2  1:12:56
But, but how are you going to know if it's if it's $1.50 whether it's just sloppy Jake writing or sales tax, you

Matthias Miller  1:13:04
you assume that if there's a sales tax, drop that and they've overpaid that, choose the lesser. So if it dropped by five and the overpaid by 10, pay five. If it dropped by 10 and the overpaid by five, like refund five, and you just always assume you have to issue a refund of a minimum of whatever they overpaid, and the then the tax drop amount, yeah,

Speaker 1  1:13:36
I mean the amount that's going to change. That changes our group tax liability is always going to be the change in the in the tax so the $5 if they still overpaid five, and you actually refund them 10, we're still just our liability only produces by file.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:59
Right?

Matthias Miller  1:14:06
The The other approach, I don't know this is appropriate,

Unknown Speaker  1:14:17
but I

Matthias Miller  1:14:23
you could find a reason. This is probably gray territory. You could find a reason for the customer to say, hey, customer, would you rather deposit a one cent check? Or can I put a line item on your on your invoice and amend your invoice?

Unknown Speaker  1:14:51
I don't

Matthias Miller  1:14:53
so next steps is for you guys to decide I. I mean, is it fair to say that you guys need to figure out whether you're always going to refund, if you guys are okay not refunding under certain certain conditions? Do you want the option to submit to the state?

Speaker 2  1:15:14
I think what we should do is we set a minimum amount, maybe $10 if it's if it's less than $10 we always just pay it to the state. If tax rate drops, $10 or less, we pay to the state $10 or 10 $10.01 or more, we always respond to the customer. Or, I mean, if we, if we set an amount with that, and then, right, we could automate that like it would

Matthias Miller  1:15:48
that then, then we need a way to say that we're going to pay this, we're going to pay the State extra tax.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:57
I mean, yeah, oh, and you

Speaker 2  1:16:00
could record that on that individual sales order, like on the RT, on that sales order, so that we would have track of

Unknown Speaker  1:16:11
you could,

Matthias Miller  1:16:13
You could have a, you know, sales tax overpayment,

Speaker 4  1:16:24
and that would only be if a sales tax rate dropped

Unknown Speaker  1:16:27
Correct.

Speaker 2  1:16:30
I mean, is that? Is that fair to say, or does that? Would that give you what you need? As far as next steps on, if we set a, set a an amount per company like this is the minimum threshold under this.

Unknown Speaker  1:16:49
Could we

Matthias Miller  1:16:51
so when Josh records a sales tax drop, could we just automatically save it dropped up to $10 we add a line item, and then they'll balance out the difference

Unknown Speaker  1:17:07
a line item on the invoice.

Matthias Miller  1:17:11
No, I'm sorry, no, a payment method. Oh, well, I

Speaker 2  1:17:17
think we, I think we could, if it's, let's say it's $10 or less, we'll just automatically pay it back to the state, like the action there would be recorded on the RG on the sales order, and it would increase our sales tax liability. And if it's more than $10 we we auto generate an invoice to be paid back to the customer. I think you want some manual,

Matthias Miller  1:17:51
manual intervention.

Speaker 2  1:17:53
I think you do there, but that would only happen once a month when you file tax. It's like you'd have two customers that, you know, reach out to whoever the sales managers, whoever would say, here's what happened, sales tax. Because of sales tax, drop refunds. We can issue these go. We need to issue these customers. And if they at that point they say, well, that's not, you know, $15 was a mess with it, then we could still go in

Matthias Miller  1:18:31
and are we sure that we want to automate this? And are we sure that we don't just want to report for Drew to see all sales, sales tax drops for the period?

Speaker 1  1:18:41
Well, we do need to record those, like, if it happened before we file, we just need the end amount. Like, you know if it was, if sales order was created in May and it was invoiced in June and later in June, something's discovered and it's changed, but we haven't. We have until July to actually file that. So any changes of June invoices prior to July, they can just go ahead and change and shift, and doesn't matter. It's then at July we we say, Okay, this invoice had this much tax paid on it. Now changes after that or that, we then need to say, okay, because of the prior payment, because of a new change, there is still this much due in tax, or there is this much credit because of an overpay.

Matthias Miller  1:19:49
Okay, so I'm not a lawyer, but to me, if you issue a sales order with estimated tax, it doesn't matter whether you filed it or paid what to the state. What matters is the customer thought they were paying estimated tax and the. Tax rate changed, whether there's a filing in there or not,

Speaker 1  1:20:05
right? But when you you're filing on invoices, so that point, it's not an estimated taxing, because it is an actual sale. That report does an actual like then it's no longer, it's it's an adjustment to your sales. If the thing changes, like you're not the only reason that the tax rate would change after that would be if somebody concludes that they put it on the wrong jurisdiction, or somebody concludes that we're refunding this customer, and we're canceling the sale. It was taxed and it was not supposed to be like some sort of a correction thing, not a rate change, because the county went up or down. I

Matthias Miller  1:21:03
Okay, well, I need a drop. I don't know why something doesn't this seems overly complicated. And I know sales tax is complicated, but it seems like we're over, unnecessarily, overly complicating it there, Mark, I think you might be onto something with having thresholds with what happens.

Speaker 2  1:21:29
Well, I'm wondering if we shouldn't start out with maybe some reporting on, like looking at what has happened so far this year. And I

Matthias Miller  1:21:44
um, how often realistically do tax drops occur?

Speaker 2  1:21:53
Well, that I think it'd be worth seeing if Josh could pull anything from tax char on that, and we could start off with that, because we're, yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:22:07
even if we did nothing, but look, we're going to do a manual process, and yes, we're going to have a way to, well, maybe we're just going to report on tax drops, and if it's one every quarter or two every year, then I don't know. It just seems very unlikely. So how often do across the board? And we could probably pull some data somewhere, I don't know how often, fundamentally, taxes go up, not down. So you're looking at 5% of tax changes, and for this to occur, you have to to take it, take an order and invoice it across a boundary of one out of 10 probability of, first of all, of a tax rate change, plus tax rate being reduced.

Unknown Speaker  1:23:11
Yeah, it's gonna be

Matthias Miller  1:23:13
so. So it seems to me like a policy that we refund and even if it's and even in refunds 80% of the time, or 60 to 60 plus percent of the time, it's going to be straight, and you can just go in the portal and issue them a refund. They're going to look at you funny for a five cent refund, but you're in the clear. So it's, I don't know, maybe I'm wrong. I still gotta drop we gotta pick it up then later. But I think we're optimizing for a very rare edge case, and I've got some questioning.

Unknown Speaker  1:23:51
Okay, well, let's

Speaker 2  1:23:57
clear our thoughts and we can, yeah, regroup, maybe Thursday for sure, if not, at least by email or whatever, before then.

Unknown Speaker  1:24:08
Sounds good. Sounds good.

Unknown Speaker  1:24:09
Yeah, thanks

Matthias Miller  1:24:10
guys. Bye.
