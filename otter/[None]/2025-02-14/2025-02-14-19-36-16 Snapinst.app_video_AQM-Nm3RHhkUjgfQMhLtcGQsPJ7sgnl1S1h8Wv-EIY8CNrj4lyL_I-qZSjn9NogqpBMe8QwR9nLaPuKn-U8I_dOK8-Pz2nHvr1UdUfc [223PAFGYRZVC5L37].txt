There's a guy sitting next to me who had a jet charter company doing 65 million a year. So he's like, how do I grow and all this, one of the first questions I ask him is, do you have a meeting once a week where you are sales people throughout the week write down all the objections they got, and more importantly, the number one reason why the person actually bought take that report and hand it over to your marketing department at the end of the week. And he goes, No. And I go, do you know why people buy? And he's like, Well, I haven't asked my sales people. And I'm like, Do you know what the major objections are? And he's like, Well, I guess I'd have to ask. I'm like, so let me get this straight. You're at $65 million a year. You want to grow to like, 200 you don't know what your major objections are you don't know why people buy, and you don't communicate this to your marketing team, which could then take it and every single week, make better and better and better marketing more tailored to exactly what people want. So basically, what you're telling me is you hate money. You're not doing 101, basic you guys could just all go away and I could still outsell you with a good marketing team. Marketing can exist without sales because marketing can handle sales by themselves. Yes, so you need to communicate what's happening to the sales people so they know what to do.
