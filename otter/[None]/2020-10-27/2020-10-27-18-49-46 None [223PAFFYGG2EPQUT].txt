All right, so here are a few thoughts about tomorrow I'm thinking we should probably do some role plays. One of the things I'm thinking about is doing some kind of roleplay centered around organic, perhaps organic tracking or some kind of lead tracking or perhaps something like that. So that could be one possible process. The other thing could be a way to track Colby emos for people, and be able to have some kind of a way to, you know, quickly pull those types of things up, or something along those lines. Those are both options that we could take a look at the other thing that we can take a look at would be okay there's a few other things I want to cover tomorrow. One of them is kind of following your own Colby mo pattern and understanding that a lot of what they're gonna want to do is first, get the information get the facts as much as they can and to kind of create structure it. And then, and then narrow the options and find out what's going to be the most risk proof against you know for for for all that stuff. Let's see. So, another, another thing with that is,

Unknown Speaker  01:16
there's some more pieces to this.

Speaker 1  01:28
Something else that could really be worth talking about tomorrow is talking about the definition, and instance model, because I feel like this is a really common model. This is a model that we use with questionnaires, and just understanding. First of all, that the model exists with an understanding of how do you actually approach this model. So, so maybe even the getting even some kind of core concepts, or data model patterns, could be really helpful.
