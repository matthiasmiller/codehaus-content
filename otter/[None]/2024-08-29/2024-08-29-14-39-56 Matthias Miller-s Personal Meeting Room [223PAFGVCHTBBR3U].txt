Matthias Miller  00:37
Okay, hey, what did you mean by spending a week in the manifesto,

Unknown Speaker  00:55
you're muted.

Speaker 1  00:59
I think of a manifesto is like a cornerstone, and that's not something that changes over time. So you so if it was going to be getting other people involved to do some edit work, I mean, obviously, you know, give feedback. I would want this to be, to have multiple passes, to be like, at the Sure, and in my mind, I was like, what if you just took the word manifesto off of it, but, but this is among, this is among friends. And it's, it's, yeah, I don't know. I don't know what. Maybe I'm putting too much emphasis on first impressions when it's like, no, they know you. They know you've they know the you behind the work. Right, right?

Unknown Speaker  02:01
Um, well,

Matthias Miller  02:06
I mean, but it's worth, it's worth asking the question, Do I really need this to close? Still goes back to overarching goal. Um,

Speaker 1  02:18
I, I think, I think you need something. You need a deeper why on your website. And I think what we have now is could easily, either as an opt in or just as as a blog format,

Unknown Speaker  02:42
page,

Speaker 1  02:45
I think, I think it's a very nice entry to request feedback and being in conversation like to me, that's, that's the best reason I

Unknown Speaker  03:06
um,

Speaker 1  03:13
and I don't think it, I don't think it necessarily has to be a branded PDF. I think it can create the Google Doc. But so if you want to levels of 8020, progression, I think the brand, it doesn't need to be

Unknown Speaker  03:35
the goal. So

Matthias Miller  03:40
can we, in two hours, get this to a draft that I can start sending out tomorrow?

Unknown Speaker  03:48
I think so. Okay, let's,

Unknown Speaker  03:51
let's, let's do this. I mean,

Unknown Speaker  03:57
we're already half halfway through, I think right

Matthias Miller  04:01
page. Three of 11. So what I'm on I see,

Unknown Speaker  04:05
all right,

Unknown Speaker  04:11
okay, let's go to,

Matthias Miller  04:17
well, I guess it's not completely 11. It's three of nine. So a third of the way through, maybe,

Speaker 1  04:27
okay, this is where we were. I think that ended well, lonely at the top two better. I

Unknown Speaker  04:51
I mean, in some ways you were doing better running your own business.

Matthias Miller  04:57
There are definitely ways in which I was I.

Unknown Speaker  05:01
Should I say running my own business?

Matthias Miller  05:06
But was it pride, or was it just accurate?

Unknown Speaker  05:12
Well, I think, I think it could be both. But, I mean, I, I've, I left my my day job because of, not for the best reasons, right? So it doesn't mean it's not the right move,

Speaker 1  05:38
but maybe, yes, the heart behind it, right? Because that's the double edged sword. It is a double edged sword. Here is I landed my whale client and settling green business. I started

Speaker 2  05:55
competing against my own client on speed, direction, compensation. Then I found myself,

Matthias Miller  06:10
how does this tie back into lonely at

Speaker 1  06:15
the top? Well, well, you you were now, you were now in a game where you didn't have anyone else to compete, right? But maybe, I don't know if your corporate audience is like, well, I'm I'm still in the hierarchy, but I kind of like that. It's like, you don't have any you're you're it. And that's something I something I realized on my own, it's easier to complain about something than to be the positive change. You know, in a company, I can do critique things right, and finding out, oh, actually, leadership is, is a lot harder. I didn't give them credit. It's, it's in some ways, like, Hey, you're, you don't have any other there's no person above you. There's no person above you for ahead of you for the next 10 years, right? You're,

Unknown Speaker  07:32
I mean, Let's just

Unknown Speaker  07:34
word vomit. I

Unknown Speaker  09:07
like, this is Yes,

Unknown Speaker  09:14
oh, I think, Whoa. It's up to changes.

Unknown Speaker  09:16
There you go. I

Matthias Miller  09:42
There's part of it where this whole thing was such a well oiled machine, except for me, in the middle of it, there really wasn't anything else to do, like,

Unknown Speaker  09:51
well running,

Unknown Speaker  09:55
you have. I.

Speaker 1  10:04
At some point, you talk about running the machine, right, and you realize you're not, you're not a machine, Right? You have a soul,

Unknown Speaker  10:19
Ghost in the Machine. You

Speaker 1  10:43
did you end up breaking with this partnership? What happened to the client? Or is that just the end of the story? Just

Matthias Miller  10:51
Well, I mean, ultimately, so between you and me, this is my brother, sure. He told me I couldn't pay him enough to buy the business from him. He didn't want the business. And I was this close to signing a long term arrangement, and everybody close to me was saying, Don't do

Unknown Speaker  11:12
it, and not

Matthias Miller  11:16
a long term kind of consulting arrangement with revenue upside and things like that. Oh, I see it, yeah. So I wouldn't have to run the team, but it'd still be involved. Everybody close to me was like, Don't do it. You need to get out.

Speaker 1  11:30
Similar to Megan, she had, she had her technical thing with website and with her brother

Unknown Speaker  11:42
and and

Unknown Speaker  11:44
she just kind of dropped It everything,

Unknown Speaker  11:56
even though, on paper,

Unknown Speaker  11:59
was a business,

Matthias Miller  12:02
yeah, I mean, there's a lot that on paper looked good about. I mean, I don't know, it wasn't anything extraordinary, but he's got a nine figure client in the wings. So that says something. He has a nine figure client. Say nine figure, I think he said 90 figure client in the wings. So there's a lot on paper that looks really good.

Speaker 1  12:26
Yeah, you could, you should put that on paper. Everything looked good. Something was being way inside of me. I

Unknown Speaker  12:40
but what was eating away inside of me?

Speaker 1  12:56
But something was eating away inside of me. Maybe M dash the need to feed the machine,

Speaker 1  13:16
or maybe it's to run the machine, and it basically, it's like you're the one who's being sacrificed, like, Who's Who's what's feeding the machine. Well, your soul, right? I

Speaker 1  14:10
I had, I had been maybe it's the competition as you win, but you're competing

Unknown Speaker  14:19
against yourself, so you're also losing. Is there a way of talking about like winning is losing?

Speaker 1  14:31
Another one way of describing this is arm wrestling. I was arm wrestling myself, so I was winning, but also losing. I

Unknown Speaker  14:46
Right one day, you're winning, but

Unknown Speaker  14:49
you're also you.

Matthias Miller  15:00
I had won every game except my own.

Unknown Speaker  15:08
You want to rename that but my own? I

Speaker 2  15:25
but, but it but a sense of dissatisfaction was eating away inside of me.

Unknown Speaker  15:38
Yep, doing that. I

Unknown Speaker  15:43
Eric, that's tight. I

Unknown Speaker  15:44
didn't want every game but my own,

Speaker 1  15:47
and I don't think you need how you lost the client or that slowly the top. I

Unknown Speaker  16:08
The truth was,

Unknown Speaker  16:13
the truth is, I, like, maybe this is where are you? Like, hey, the game is all artificial. Like, it's, it's, I made up this game.

Speaker 1  16:32
The only, the only way to win the game was to stop playing it maybe, or I on.

Unknown Speaker  16:58
Right?

Speaker 1  17:00
Something Doe says is, there's, there's different reasons why people quit. There's good reasons and bad reasons. One bad reason is if the work is hard, right? One good reason is you, if you find yourself you

Unknown Speaker  17:25
not really following your dream.

Unknown Speaker  17:31
I think you could own i

Speaker 1  17:48
But my own. And this is maybe this is creating the space for inner the inner truth, which I guess I

Unknown Speaker  18:04
that's at the very end. That's okay, all right.

Matthias Miller  18:07
Can we Nix, can I Nix all this?

Unknown Speaker  18:14
I don't know if this is important. Is like, hey, the reason why I I

Speaker 1  18:28
mean, the transition is like, Hey, I I'm not, I like that. Because it's like, you think other people are your enemy, but really they're your allies. You want to collaborate with that's deep, right? Your client was your ally, Right? Your brother? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  19:42
I

Unknown Speaker  20:40
And My

Unknown Speaker  20:48
allies into enemies.

Matthias Miller  20:55
I could never be sure what would be used.

Unknown Speaker  20:59
Never, yeah. Thanks.

Unknown Speaker  21:05
That's when I

Matthias Miller  21:18
this is a little bit of a bold look at my contribution to the problem kind of radical ownership here.

Speaker 1  21:31
Yeah, I think, I think, you know, it at least prepares some people for boldness and and obviously, anyone who reads this and is like, I don't, you know, this would turn off people who aren't okay with some level of self disclosure, yeah, so maybe that's I mean, maybe I'm Just being optimistic, but that this might be a nice, polarizing, a nice way of rocking the shotgun.

Matthias Miller  22:12
Okay, can we know Yank? I think you can. Yeah, I'm gonna throw it over in the just started a little scrap document, which I don't know that we need to keep, but okay, oh,

Speaker 1  22:30
the truth is, or the dragon Pete Turn my turn my allies into enemies, because, because I could, I could never be sure what would be used against me. Great, oh, this.

Matthias Miller  22:56
You could almost put that right up here. I'd

Unknown Speaker  22:59
rather do that because I want to end this. I want this to be the last line, because it goes into collaboration right after that.

Unknown Speaker  23:12
Wait, like,

Unknown Speaker  23:15
yeah, this.

Matthias Miller  23:19
No, like, this,

Unknown Speaker  23:22
that's better, yeah, yeah,

Matthias Miller  23:24
the only way to win the game is weird, how non sequential this stuff is, but changing the order makes

Unknown Speaker  23:31
such an impact. Yeah,

Speaker 1  23:33
she's this. You know, it ties it to the top. But this is nice to to. This is the epiphany. And it leads you to, Oh, does this? Should this go at the end on its own?

Matthias Miller  23:58
Oh, yeah. And then move that, move that, and then is,

Unknown Speaker  24:06
boom, that's tight. I like that.

Unknown Speaker  24:09
There are no enemies to beat.

Speaker 1  24:20
This feels a bit it shifted from like story to right,

Matthias Miller  24:25
no but the moment,

Matthias Miller  24:38
I think Kevin Thompson is one of the guys that jolted me loose of this stuff. I was part of his impact and legacy group for a little over a year, and then couldn't afford it when I started burning down my business and rebuilding I could see myself going back with more clarity, but um.

Matthias Miller  25:13
So that could be the moment. I mean, that could be the a another defining moment. I um, what's this, you know, it's the idea of, I met this guy who had built his entire life around collaborative strategy,

Speaker 1  25:32
right? It's the, I mean, maybe, maybe the appearance of the mentor should be like scene one. But that's okay, that this is fine. I think this, this is a right, and I like that because it's like you, you. It's like you needed some out, someone outside of you you need. You needed, basically a coach who would tell you the truth, who lived in a different way, right? So, in some ways, you've now become, the end of this is you've become. Kevin Thompson,

Unknown Speaker  26:15
right? Okay, so,

Speaker 1  26:29
I mean, impact a legacy is something everyone cares about. I

Unknown Speaker  26:43
maybe that's too much of his story.

Unknown Speaker  26:47
Truth is, there were no enemies to beat.

Speaker 1  26:57
So here's here's something about Silicon Valley. Is someone said this, you play, what is it? Long term games? It's like high trust long term games. So we don't have to. It's not about whether you get the deal today, because you know, two years from now, you might have a better arrangement, right? And you'll have that relationship, you can sit down and have coffee again, and they'll, they'll be there, you know, so, which

Matthias Miller  27:34
is very much a Kevin thing, um,

Speaker 1  27:37
maybe this is, I mean, this is good. It's a trust in the trust, but something, something in you needs to die. Maybe that's where

Speaker 1  27:58
maybe I discovered, I discovered there are no enemies. There were no maybe you should you just say that I discovered there were no enemies to be.

Speaker 1  28:17
It's not as powerful like maybe there were no enemies to be as a little stronger, yeah. Okay,

Matthias Miller  28:25
all right, so then how to transition into this next space? I

Speaker 1  28:48
I think this will be a way better lead than than this. I like the

Speaker 1  29:01
what, what was it that you saw in him or perceived in him?

Matthias Miller  29:08
The reason I joined that was because I felt like he has this ability to make friends with people, genuinely build friendships with successful people. And yeah, I mean, I realized

Unknown Speaker  29:36
I This is basically I was getting in my own way. I needed someone to unblock me.

Speaker 1  30:31
I needed, maybe it's I needed someone to show me a New Way. I

Unknown Speaker  31:01
I just wanted to find one I

Speaker 1  31:27
I mean, this is kind of where you See what you want for 100, 100 proof Man, I

Unknown Speaker  31:46
successful is just weird, but I

Matthias Miller  32:14
I don't even know It'll stuck.

Speaker 1  32:19
Well part, okay, maybe this is it. Their impact and legacy is about a their custom designed life. It's about them, whereas you were playing a competitive game about other people's outcomes. Yeah, this is now maybe a shift to an internal outcome, like an internal vision, Yeah, what

Matthias Miller  32:59
if he calls it a master. You call some roundtables that the lead in ones

Speaker 1  33:07
you could Yes. You could say there were no I joined, I joined a roundtable

Unknown Speaker  33:15
where I experienced, i

Unknown Speaker  33:29
a i

Unknown Speaker  34:23
The legacy they wanted.

Speaker 1  34:32
And they and yeah, we supported each other to that,

Unknown Speaker  34:38
to to

Unknown Speaker  34:41
to find and fund our dreams.

Matthias Miller  34:50
It's not our dreams, even I.

Unknown Speaker  35:36
Okay,

Speaker 1  35:38
where I could, where? I joined a roundtable, where I where I began.

Unknown Speaker  35:49
Maybe it's where I showed the chinks in my armor. So is like your self disclosure, and you could do it because you were shoulder to shoulder with people you could trust,

Unknown Speaker  36:14
right Where I let the chinks in my armor show. I

Speaker 1  36:33
instead of my my vom

Unknown Speaker  36:39
will be used against me. I began to receive,

Speaker 1  36:47
right? What's What are you receiving? I like the paradigm of using and receiving. We're always either Am I approaching someone to use or to receive and receive has A gift in relational

Unknown Speaker  37:03
dimension,

Unknown Speaker  37:14
I received.

Unknown Speaker  37:16
I received, i

Speaker 1  37:23
i received support and strength,

Unknown Speaker  37:30
generously.

Speaker 1  37:36
I I was understood. I was maybe there's like an empathy component you could highlight, like it's

Unknown Speaker  37:55
with people who understood me, who had and who

Matthias Miller  38:03
wanted my best for me?

Unknown Speaker  38:04
Yeah, there you go. There you go, great.

Speaker 1  38:12
I think we can start dropping. We can just, I almost want, I almost want to drop. Talking about competition now, like, altogether, yeah, because we've it was, it's almost like a little too much, yeah, I think people need a and maybe that they'll feel like, by the absence of talking about competition, you'll they'll feel like more life is the other section was, was a lot. So let's pretty intense, yeah, so let's, let's just drop it all together, and self disclosure or healing or support, I

Matthias Miller  38:55
mean, but I'm it's not quite well, it kind of is self disclosure. Yeah, I guess it is

Speaker 1  39:15
right. Instead of tearing you down, They built you up. I

Unknown Speaker  40:04
They saw the good.

Speaker 1  40:16
They became fierce advocates, or go.

Unknown Speaker  40:35
When I lost i

Speaker 1  40:51
i Yeah, I almost want to say when I struggled to believe in myself, They saw The good I

Unknown Speaker  42:22
there's receive help,

Speaker 2  42:35
Find have released resistance give generously to all. Oh, yeah, receive help from others. Give generously to all,

Unknown Speaker  42:51
not to all, though, give generously

Unknown Speaker  42:56
to your people, to you,

Unknown Speaker  43:00
to your tribe. Yeah, there we go.

Matthias Miller  43:06
Can we just embrace resistance?

Unknown Speaker  43:16
There's a much better section

Speaker 1  43:21
we can get away from talking about traders, uh, or cowardly.

Matthias Miller  43:34
And then are you need anything from here?

Speaker 1  43:36
Um, maybe save it elsewhere.

Unknown Speaker  43:40
Yeah, I'll throw it over

Unknown Speaker  43:47
there call you a word hoarder. What's that I'm going to call you a word hoarder,

Speaker 1  43:55
hoarder? Oh, I really only wanted one, one or two lines from the whole thing.

Unknown Speaker  44:04
Do you still want some of that?

Unknown Speaker  44:10
This? This line. I got it. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  44:22
oops. There you go. Paste it.

Speaker 1  44:28
And I am not sure this doesn't need to go there, but, but

Unknown Speaker  44:38
then the outcome is, I

Matthias Miller  44:44
um, when, as I stopped, yeah, I diluting my actions by chasing other people's outcomes. I got to double down on the things that i i. I was specifically meant to build. As I stood shoulder to shoulder with my comrades, I found something I had wanted all along.

Unknown Speaker  45:21
Dude, that's

Speaker 1  45:24
weird. You're working in, I think you're working in a different sections, little epiphanies. Those are,

Unknown Speaker  45:33
that's the, that's what you want to impart. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  45:41
there we go. You have shoulder to shoulders. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  45:47
that's that's the one as I walked alongside my comrades,

Speaker 1  45:54
my brothers in arms. And that's maybe the ties back to the earlier, right, although maybe you don't want brothers and arms

Unknown Speaker  46:11
because of Gender.

Speaker 1  46:16
You say I call the arms earlier, right? I mean, you can say brothers in arms like they're these were the guys.

Unknown Speaker  46:29
It's true they were. I don't think I ever was in a in a pod with any of the ladies who remembers

Unknown Speaker  46:42
collaborative strategy.

Unknown Speaker  46:49
Okay,

Matthias Miller  46:53
so then this is the loop back to failure and financial

Speaker 1  46:58
maybe you could say you this has a I had learned, I had learned an important lesson, and now you can now that gives you, like, permission to be

Unknown Speaker  47:13
teachery,

Unknown Speaker  47:22
which is what? What's that I'm

Unknown Speaker  47:52
what? Yeah,

Speaker 1  48:08
okay, I like this earlier.

Unknown Speaker  48:16
Like this. This feels like the

Unknown Speaker  48:21
the bold lesson,

Unknown Speaker  48:22
it's this,

Matthias Miller  48:26
what if we just do this? I learned, yeah, yeah, exactly. I had found the unreasonable, by the way, one of the things that I don't know how often it should be, but somewhere in here, maybe it's one's perception. There should be like a call out, which is the and I think this could be it, the

Unknown Speaker  48:46
bold, the highlight, this is

Unknown Speaker  48:54
what I

Matthias Miller  49:04
and then we, I don't know that this is necessary. I don't know how to wrap it. Do you Do you want to keep anything here?

Unknown Speaker  49:17
Well, I, if

Speaker 1  49:22
I think, okay, if this was the PDF, you have a box with the Sun Tzu quote, right? So this is like,

Speaker 1  49:38
right? I don't think you, I don't think this is I don't think this is relevant.

Unknown Speaker  49:49
All right, so there you go.

Speaker 1  49:55
Okay, where did you get a signature victory? I. Um,

Speaker 1  50:08
like, I other than, is there an external result that shows it? Yeah, people can point to, I know there's an internal shift.

Matthias Miller  50:18
So, I mean, we can point to a number of things when I tell the story of firing my not the same client, but my other big client, biggest client, actually bigger than this one, when, while we were in the middle of getting a mortgage and with the baby on the way, I so that's kind of a when a client engagement took a sudden turn for the worse. I'm gonna get more watermelon, okay? I'm gonna go grab some water and some tea stuff too. I'm

Speaker 1  54:09
Um, oh, okay, How about this? I don't. Okay. If imagine, tell me if this is true or not. Did you notice your client competing? Like, imagine what if it's your client now you've, you've learned the lesson. You spot it in others, and you're like, I'm not going to play the game.

Matthias Miller  54:42
Okay? Well, let's, let's unpack it, see if it's true. So the guy told me afterward that it's only ever his his engagements have only ever worked all or nothing. So either he is super hands on. Rolling everything or completely hands off. And there is no in between. He replaced, he replaced his brother who was a partner on the sales calls. He wanted me to stay on for tech and basically wanted to take over. Okay, here's one way, rather than then address my shortcomings, he gave me the boot and said, I can do better than you, but not my shortcomings. I had asked him. I had asked him specifically for support early on. Fun fact, I had another free call that I extended a little bit today from a guy who's done memos and has not had any success with which, shockingly, is because he's running from the very thing,

Unknown Speaker  56:06
like, you offered a free call. And this guy

Matthias Miller  56:10
No, like, I No, no. I mean, I offered a free call. He's got memos for forever for all this stuff. And it's like, here's the path he should take. He's like, I think I'll go over there. Like, maybe if I get a job, I can do some of what I want to do and get promoted. I don't know why even saying this. You

Speaker 1  56:30
don't what? If you don't talk about competition, you just talk about a controlling client. Yes, and you had the current courage to confront and say, No, you walked away Right,

Speaker 1  56:54
even though it hurts you, personally, like, financially, um,

Matthias Miller  57:05
okay, so, how do we say this? Oh, hang on, I gotta, I gotta figure out.

Unknown Speaker  57:18
I need, I

Unknown Speaker  57:31
um, reconvene, uh,

Matthias Miller  57:32
no, give me one second. I'll put in in uh,

Matthias Miller  57:44
I just need to I need to have my pick up lunch For me somewhere, and I'm not sure where yet.

Unknown Speaker  58:02
I okay

Unknown Speaker  58:53
all right, so

Speaker 1  58:57
all you need to say is, when I, when I my past cons, like your past competitive self, you were a because of your past competitive self, you were able to identify this controlling element in a client.

Matthias Miller  59:21
Okay, so, how do we how do we frame this? I

Matthias Miller  59:47
um, learning. Um, because I had untangled myself from the game of competition, I immediately recognized when one of my clients I

Matthias Miller  1:00:23
turn the tables and started to use their power. I don't know that that whatever, it's something Courage. I

Unknown Speaker  1:00:59
What if you say this,

Unknown Speaker  1:01:11
Mr. Miyagi,

Unknown Speaker  1:01:15
what's the Miyagi card?

Matthias Miller  1:01:20
I mean, it's the whole, I'm gonna beat you into smithereens versus,

Unknown Speaker  1:01:26
sure.

Matthias Miller  1:01:27
I mean, I don't know that that's completely right, but it, you know, it's Something like that. Yeah, I saw hyper control, and I

Unknown Speaker  1:02:12
Okay,

Matthias Miller  1:02:17
you know, I don't know it's something like this. I to rebel from the unreasonable courage to rebel against the fear of failure.

Unknown Speaker  1:02:28
You could take this out.

Matthias Miller  1:02:31
Yes, I agree to rebel against fear failure to rebel against the to step away from the isolating game of competition and to lean fully into collaborative strategy. When a client engagement took a sudden turn for the worse, I I recognized the fight for control and chose not to take part,

Speaker 1  1:03:00
their their fart, their fight, or just the fight for control,

Matthias Miller  1:03:04
I recognized, oh, I don't Know, the fight for control, their fight for control. I

Matthias Miller  1:03:29
The ego response is Oh. And then, by the way, I walked away and helped another plane in their same industry. And you know, we had this exceptional result, which is all very ego driven, but it's not the lesson we're trying to

Unknown Speaker  1:03:50
maybe that's What you say is,

Speaker 1  1:03:57
I didn't, I didn't know that. Doing, doing the right, the right thing, like, basically, a a good, a good client, was around, was around the corner, and I think you talk about this later, is like, if you, if you move forward, you'll find that your trust is met with everything you need is met. If you meet Okay, when you move forward courageously in trust, your needs get met. Some you have that later on, right? I do

Speaker 1  1:04:55
was waiting, waited, just run. Us wait around the corner.

Matthias Miller  1:05:04
I didn't know great client waited around the corner. I only knew this was the new game I was playing,

Unknown Speaker  1:05:19
waiting for me, waiting for me. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:05:23
around the corner.

Matthias Miller  1:05:25
Oh, okay, any of this seem to

Unknown Speaker  1:05:30
keep waitin.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:35
I love this. I

Unknown Speaker  1:05:55
I only knew something about

Speaker 1  1:06:08
the only game I wanted to play was collaboration, the only game, the only game worth playing was if was shared collaboration or was,

Matthias Miller  1:06:36
I only knew, didn't know a great I just knew The only game worth playing was one of shared collaboration. I'll go strongly, one way or the other. If you like it,

Speaker 1  1:06:50
I like it, yeah, I think, I think we can go to the next,

Matthias Miller  1:06:57
any line number two, pressures and obligations.

Speaker 1  1:07:01
Okay, now, is this, this is, is this timeline wise, or is this just concurrently?

Unknown Speaker  1:07:10
Well, this is,

Speaker 1  1:07:11
I feel like this is, this is a three evils that are mixed and tangled,

Matthias Miller  1:07:19
right? Yeah, I think so. I think we could go, why wouldn't we go straight back, make it super clear, right?

Unknown Speaker  1:07:40
You have,

Speaker 1  1:07:43
that's your first line, and on enemy line number one.

Matthias Miller  1:07:46
Correct, what I'm doing is I'm anchoring everything back to there in the depressed meant one thing,

Speaker 1  1:07:58
if you say my early life in In the Midwest and the depressed, there we go. I

Speaker 1  1:09:10
I'm not sure if that I think you're stealing thunder from do whatever It takes.

Matthias Miller  1:09:19
What if? Oh, okay, let's do this. I

Unknown Speaker  1:10:00
I don't know i

Speaker 1  1:10:25
Okay, well, let me, let me read through it, and just remember what this is about. Okay, hey, look at this. Okay, family, you just finished with the family. Move here, right? What if you don't? No, no, you don't need to talk about you don't need to talk about that. What if? What if the family move, or the brash move, you did the brash thing right? Because you left the client, right? You took the personal risk. That's the courage. That is the courage. What if that flows from the previous, yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:11:12
okay, well, you could say this.

Matthias Miller  1:11:22
I mean, that's kind of lame, but

Matthias Miller  1:11:38
I think I think it's almost like

Matthias Miller  1:11:48
there's almost this way of thinking in which the pressures and obligations are the things that keep you

Matthias Miller  1:12:00
alive. And you could also talk about tornadoes in this space.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:17
I like this line

Matthias Miller  1:12:19
downward pressure, obligation was familiar to my life in the press Midwest.

Speaker 1  1:12:34
We knew, we knew tornadoes like you wouldn't want to step outside, right? It's like you don't you want to stay where you are. You don't want to take risks.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:46
That's fair.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:56
How long were you in Kansas?

Unknown Speaker  1:12:59
20 years.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:01
Well, how are you doing? Something? Touch,

Unknown Speaker  1:13:04
what? Okay, so, get this. We didn't talk about this. This is weird. I worked eight summers in Inman, Kansas,

Matthias Miller  1:13:18
so my parents, my parents, only bought food and bookstore in Pleasant View. Do you know where that is? Yeah, yeah, the bought food and bookstore.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:28
I don't.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:28
I Dutch kitchen.

Speaker 1  1:13:31
I wasn't as I just stayed at the farm, really, like, I drove places. I mean, Hutch. Hutch was the only, like the only, not that I really cared about this, but outlet, like they had a movie theater and and a restaurant we could go eat, and like my boss's wife was so against pork, like we we brought food back from the restaurant and put it in the fridge. And she was, like, appalled. But anyways, I did. I did the wheat harvest for eight summers.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:13
That's crazy. That's crazy.

Speaker 1  1:14:17
I also worked in Salina. This is the first, first job I ever had, painting. I don't know I was. I guess it started with painting, but contract stuff, and then I did a summer working at a geotechnical probate company. They do like they do soil strength testing for like they do testing for environmental animation and anyways, I had a good time in Kansas.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:59
The. Crazy, but

Speaker 1  1:15:01
I'm like, I'm not an engineer. I'm like, I don't I just, I'm not a farm boy. Like, I don't I. I probably overstayed my time. Like, I had a great I loved it. Yeah, they're just built different. Like, everyone there's like, man, these guys are

Unknown Speaker  1:15:23
tough.

Speaker 1  1:15:26
They can solve any. They can solve anything. Maybe, maybe, maybe, that's maybe, that's what you talk about. Growing up in the Midwest, you're on your own. You have to tough it out and solve everything yourself. There we go. Sam, talking about background would help. Growing

Matthias Miller  1:15:47
up in the mid Midwest, you were on your own.

Speaker 2  1:15:51
You had to pass it out and solve and solve problems, right

Unknown Speaker  1:16:12
on your own. You hadn't we had no you had no one else. Yeah, I

Unknown Speaker  1:16:24
Yes, sorry, that's, I guess that's repetitive. Here.

Speaker 1  1:16:36
You were on your own. I I

Matthias Miller  1:16:46
mean, it's a little, it's a little, it's a little different, though, because there's also very strong sense of community. So it's not like,

Speaker 1  1:17:02
well, maybe this is the positive. Maybe that's, I don't know if you want that. This is the negative part section, but this is kind of, if it's community, it's collaborative, and it's even if it's hard, it's shared. It's it's not isolation,

Matthias Miller  1:17:24
um, that pressure in the Midwest. Um,

Speaker 1  1:17:32
maybe this is you talk about rugged individualism, right?

Unknown Speaker  1:17:40
I'm trying to,

Speaker 1  1:17:48
I had a very like, I think I had a very unique experience, and everything about it was good, like, I just,

Matthias Miller  1:18:01
well, I mean, you have to bring my, the religious upbringing into this as well that you didn't. I

Speaker 1  1:18:10
was just there for work summers, like I didn't live. The site of Kansas I saw was

Matthias Miller  1:18:22
great. Well, if I wasn't doing, if I wasn't in a religious environment that was suffocating, in a job that was in the line, I mean, apart from that, it was really,

Speaker 1  1:18:35
and, but, but those are, like, the main parts of life, your family and work. Well,

Matthias Miller  1:18:40
yeah, plus family dysfunction, but I mean, besides that, it was excellent trying to take a step back. I don't know how to Okay, here's one way. But this, this wasn't the way I had been trained to do it. You could go more the authoritarian. When a client asks you to do something, tells you to jump, you ask them how high when the boss tells you to do this.

Speaker 1  1:19:11
So that's your last line. It's not about the Midwest, it's about when they say jump or turn you turn you jump. So maybe you want the section to be about clients and not the Midwest. May just say before,

Unknown Speaker  1:19:41
seems giving me grief.

Speaker 1  1:19:42
Maybe you talk about, hey, what gets, what the challenge and like, what do you have to be courageous with? You have to be courageous with obligations and pressures. Right? I.

Matthias Miller  1:20:02
But it's like it's one layer deeper, because wasn't just about the allegation, the pressure and courage, it was about what it was shaping you into

Unknown Speaker  1:20:21
here we go. Let's try this. That's better.

Speaker 1  1:20:31
Well, I like this one line. If I had to pick a line this, this is pretty good. Let me i is,

Unknown Speaker  1:20:46
I feel

Speaker 1  1:20:49
like I was going to copy it. Yeah, you corrected it, yeah, yeah, great. So

Unknown Speaker  1:20:57
that's a good one.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:01
Obligations.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:14
I think this is a better starter. This is risk

Unknown Speaker  1:21:23
kind of life

Unknown Speaker  1:21:26
has not prepared me

Unknown Speaker  1:21:29
success.

Matthias Miller  1:21:32
Well, I mean, it's more like I had, I had been conditioned to accept it. The downward pressure was familiar to my life in the Midwest, yeah, the moment I got elevated to a a position of status and success, I stepped into The battle against pressures and obligations. Um, if

Speaker 1  1:22:01
that maybe you could say the the external force of pressures and obligations multiplied,

Unknown Speaker  1:22:15
instead of the,

Speaker 1  1:22:18
no, it's, it's like you, you grew up in that kind of environment, but now that you had success, it's like you had more weight to carry.

Speaker 1  1:22:40
Right? That's what that's what Josh says, is people, entrepreneurs think, Oh, if I just had this revenue, it would solve my problem. It's like, now you, your problems get bigger

Matthias Miller  1:22:54
on The stakes, and also, same problems higher stakes. I

Unknown Speaker  1:23:15
um,

Unknown Speaker  1:23:38
I don't know if it's worth

Unknown Speaker  1:23:42
We weaving in

Unknown Speaker  1:23:53
at different points,

Unknown Speaker  1:23:58
talking about I

Speaker 1  1:24:08
we did competitive strategy, and we're now we're doing the false self Right, right? So maybe, maybe it's worth incorporating real and false self language. I I

Speaker 3  1:24:31
mean, it's a little bit, I mean, but that's a little bit of do whatever it takes.

Speaker 1  1:24:36
Like, yeah, that would go later in the next slide, in the next section, ladies,

Matthias Miller  1:24:41
but, but how does false self not tie into the do whatever it takes, and real self?

Unknown Speaker  1:24:48
How does it not? How?

Matthias Miller  1:24:51
I don't see how it ties in.

Speaker 1  1:24:53
Um, I think you. Right? I think the false self is controlling, right? The real Self is courageous,

Unknown Speaker  1:25:09
okay, the false self is isolated. The real Self is collaborative, or maybe is competitive, collaborative. The false self is hustle, grit, pushing, whereas the real Self is, this is my language. You're pushing or you're pulling right? You're pushed by fear, until you're you're pulled by vision. That's, that's my, my quote language. But

Speaker 1  1:25:49
so I think there's the real, the real self, I don't know, has more flow to it. The false self is like grind, grinding away. But maybe, maybe you don't need to work it in.

Matthias Miller  1:26:10
This is bad wording, but I

Matthias Miller  1:26:29
Okay, this is like, not whatever, but

Speaker 1  1:26:42
you could say, well, when did you leave Kansas? When did you Well, hey, can you say, like, when you left Kansas, you taste the success like your pressures multiply. I

Matthias Miller  1:27:08
Okay, so you would kill this, yeah, it wasn't technically tied to when I left Kansas, but that's

Speaker 1  1:27:22
so one, one, something, you know what they say in NLP, like you can't really make behavioral change, environmental change, I should say, because Wherever you go, there you are.

Unknown Speaker  1:27:41
It This means, you know, if you took on, if you took on a more role responsibilities,

Speaker 1  1:27:59
it's almost like, here's the thing. Think of it like the Atlas Shrugged, okay, and you're, you're, you're, you're finally standing up. You're getting on, you know, you're getting stable, but, but as you're doing that, you're carrying more responsibilities. So it's like you're, you're standing up against gravity. It's harder. It's easier to just stay in a crouch position than to stand against

Matthias Miller  1:28:30
a fair but how does it translate into i

Unknown Speaker  1:28:49
Okay, let's

Matthias Miller  1:28:57
if you wanted to also tie it in this is it could be something like this symbolized a, you know, second,

Unknown Speaker  1:29:09
well, look, go to unexpected defeat,

Speaker 1  1:29:14
right? Yeah, and maybe you don't want to rob material from here. But this is, uh,

Unknown Speaker  1:29:23
let me go front door. I

Matthias Miller  1:30:08
Can you hang on for a Few minutes? We'll Be right back. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:33:29
I'm eating breakfast and lunch right now, so, And dinner and well, dinner's coming. So no, um, I

Matthias Miller  1:33:50
think the only thing that we're trying to convey is like it's always, you're always at odds trying to ward off pressures and obligations. I

Unknown Speaker  1:34:05
Okay, then this paragraph works.

Matthias Miller  1:34:19
If you had a family, you couldn't make any brash moves. Wasn't really about cars

Unknown Speaker  1:34:32
the business. You couldn't

Unknown Speaker  1:34:39
risk taking extra time off without paying for it

Unknown Speaker  1:34:54
couldn't speak truth

Unknown Speaker  1:34:57
to i.

Matthias Miller  1:36:00
I mean, I think this is a little bit of a I would love to universalize it, but it's a little bit of a Midwestern thing, perhaps, but where you're leaning on like this is Just what you did, but it's a little bit, I

Unknown Speaker  1:36:44
you could say,

Unknown Speaker  1:36:52
I like that. It's like, it's

Speaker 1  1:36:56
you didn't question, you didn't question what you grew up with.

Unknown Speaker  1:37:01
It's all you know.

Speaker 1  1:37:15
I think you could still say, Yeah,

Speaker 1  1:37:35
should you Say mentality or mindset? I

Unknown Speaker  1:38:00
Well playing field.

Unknown Speaker  1:38:17
Awesome. Appreciate it.

Unknown Speaker  1:38:42
I never thought this is where you put anybody here. Question, what I learned, what I grew up with, I

Unknown Speaker  1:39:03
right?

Unknown Speaker  1:39:13
Everything became i

Unknown Speaker  1:39:24
i would put it like this. I

Unknown Speaker  1:39:43
can we mix this? Yeah,

Speaker 1  1:39:50
yeah, so that's okay, this is your environment. And now here's here's a life scenario. Oh, no, no. Now this is the life scenario. The next one is the life scenario. Well,

Unknown Speaker  1:40:08
I don't know if this works now.

Speaker 1  1:40:18
It's more like the pressure made your beliefs. It's not chipping away your beliefs.

Unknown Speaker  1:40:31
This could go elsewhere. I

Unknown Speaker  1:40:52
I think, I think that's a little bit repetitive,

Unknown Speaker  1:41:01
by the way,

Speaker 1  1:41:02
can you say my life was about grit, hustle and motivation?

Unknown Speaker  1:41:12
Please.

Speaker 1  1:41:19
It was about winning and doing whatever it takes. It was about doing whatever it takes to win. I don't

Matthias Miller  1:41:31
think it's about winning. It's about doing

Unknown Speaker  1:41:37
you do you do whatever it takes. I

Unknown Speaker  1:41:48
period, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:41:54
no matter the cost personal,

Matthias Miller  1:42:14
I mean, there's this little thing, like, I never thought to question the hustle culture either,

Unknown Speaker  1:42:21
yeah, that's really what I like, right? Yeah, that's, that's something I, I want to tear down.

Speaker 2  1:42:34
Show up, trade shows. Now,

Unknown Speaker  1:42:51
what if you just

Matthias Miller  1:42:58
it's almost like then I stepped into the business world and I discovered I discovered I wasn't actually alone, or like Italy, it validated and affirmed it you were what like it validated when I stepped into the business World. It validated and affirmed. Heard that

Unknown Speaker  1:43:17
right. I

Unknown Speaker  1:43:22
think you can say, I

Unknown Speaker  1:43:56
no voices. Voices.

Speaker 4  1:44:02
I don't

Unknown Speaker  1:44:22
know if you need this on i

Unknown Speaker  1:44:52
i think,

Unknown Speaker  1:44:58
okay, yeah, I.

Unknown Speaker  1:45:28
Yeah, I

Speaker 1  1:47:09
there's true self, yeah, that's, That's what you talk about. I

Unknown Speaker  1:47:23
I'm not sure if you need these.

Matthias Miller  1:47:25
No, I the three is the one. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:47:29
I thought so, yeah, Skype,

Unknown Speaker  1:47:32
it's, it's more true and more succinct. I

Speaker 1  1:47:53
I think you could, I think, I think you just end with this, because doing the opposite means you've lost your compass. I just like

Unknown Speaker  1:48:03
that, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:48:07
see that works

Matthias Miller  1:48:10
nice had been reduced to a simple rule.

Matthias Miller  1:48:22
This was an infuriating session. I bought a John Benson celery package way back in the day, and got a free consult with the Tony Robbins certified coach, and our conversation consisted of, all, right, so what's your why? And I would throw something out, and he's like, that's a what, not a why. What's your why? I'm like, throw something that's, that's a what, that's not why. What's your why? I'm like, Dude, I You're supposed to be the one helping me find my why. I like, what are you asking for? Like, anyway,

Unknown Speaker  1:48:53
not helpful. No.

Matthias Miller  1:48:56
Nothing against, I mean, whatever. Nothing against John, nothing against Tony, sure, I may have been a fluke. Coach may have been, you know, probably some of both.

Speaker 1  1:49:07
Well, they they have to pay, like, a lot to become a coach, as

Matthias Miller  1:49:13
it was, like a $500 you know, or some kind of high, yeah. I

Unknown Speaker  1:49:24
my why?

Unknown Speaker  1:49:28
Because I couldn't find one.

Unknown Speaker  1:49:34
I do need. I do need to. I do have an obligation. Now. I um, can you drop off now? We can meet at four, if you want.

Speaker 3  1:49:48
No, meet him out of the office by four your time.

Speaker 1  1:49:51
Okay, give me, give me. Give me a second. Okay.

Speaker 1  1:52:45
Okay, I I can stay till you leave. Okay, all right, where are we at?

Unknown Speaker  1:52:58
Okay, calling.

Matthias Miller  1:53:08
Alright, so there's a question, what broke me out of this? I remember there's a few defining moments. One is when I first watched Marcus Buckinghams. You know, play to your strengths. DVD, um, there's this Tony Robbins thing where, you know it's and then There's the binging on the on the personality profiles. I

Matthias Miller  1:54:05
i We could say this, I didn't know how lost I was. Yeah, I got angry with my Tony Robbins coach, who asked me about my why, um, some ways to be fun, to extern for me, to externalize it here, who asked me about my why? Because he couldn't help me find one. Show me the game. Show me what it takes to win. Don't ask me who I am. It wasn't that I had lost my internal compass, truth be told, I never found it. But it's not even unique abilities and superpowers. This feels like,

Speaker 1  1:54:49
well, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's down below,

Unknown Speaker  1:54:52
yeah, so can we just Nix this?

Unknown Speaker  1:54:55
I never

Matthias Miller  1:54:56
found it interesting, and even if I had it, wouldn't have. Mattered. Spaces I was in. I needed

Unknown Speaker  1:55:12
to be

Matthias Miller  1:55:15
what I needed to do, whatever it took. I

Unknown Speaker  1:55:23
to run the mission to,

Unknown Speaker  1:55:34
what to run the machine.

Unknown Speaker  1:55:36
To, okay,

Speaker 2  1:55:38
I like run the machine, sorry, yep,

Matthias Miller  1:55:43
all good, Ah, sorry, my bad. I didn't know anything was amiss till I found myself burned out with no sense of direction.

Speaker 1  1:56:03
I think you can just say this, this all led to burnout, because he's always talked about, you've already talked about, no sense of direction. This led to massive burnout. I

Matthias Miller  1:56:35
i did face to face with the frightening questions I

Unknown Speaker  1:56:53
who Am I? Really? I

Unknown Speaker  1:57:42
what working genius wasn't around at that time.

Unknown Speaker  1:57:55
Those only scratched the surface. Yeah, i

Unknown Speaker  1:58:22
By the way,

Unknown Speaker  1:58:31
Okay, nevermind you Do talk about sanctuary. I

Unknown Speaker  1:58:57
Well,

Unknown Speaker  1:59:02
This might be the last line i

Unknown Speaker  1:59:24
I see, I see a rewording. I

Unknown Speaker  1:59:41
think you just say,

Unknown Speaker  1:59:44
I suddenly came alive.

Matthias Miller  1:59:54
There's a long pause before the sudden I. Point.

Unknown Speaker  2:00:05
It's yeah, you could say, you could say,

Matthias Miller  2:00:10
I mean, no, the shift, if it was a sudden, it was committing to show up as my real self and only my real self. When I finally committed to show up as my real self,

Speaker 1  2:00:26
nothing else. Yeah, I when I finally committed to show up only as my real self,

Unknown Speaker  2:00:34
show up

Unknown Speaker  2:00:37
only as my real self, nothing. I

Unknown Speaker  2:00:44
You could say nothing else.

Unknown Speaker  2:00:58
I came alive. I

Speaker 1  2:01:07
What if you just say, what if you just say, I committed to show up as my real self and nothing else. It's a decision point.

Speaker 2  2:01:19
Yeah, that's, that's when I came alive. Yeah, there we go. It's fine. We actually have a very similar thought process.

Matthias Miller  2:01:32
Love it, mind meld. Um, okay, I think

Unknown Speaker  2:01:40
this. That's not needed,

Matthias Miller  2:01:45
that's you can almost go in the signature victory, though, go for it,

Speaker 1  2:01:52
because it's, it's decision point, and now you're talking about your real self.

Matthias Miller  2:02:01
All right, signature victory when I stopped pretending, I found the unexpected gift of connection others had tried to befriend my

Speaker 4  2:02:26
facade and had failed. I

Unknown Speaker  2:02:44
You could say that the facade crumbled.

Speaker 1  2:02:58
Who? Who could? Who could? I mean this, the people I collaborated with, maybe you could tie it back, is like they, they saw more than you were letting on, right? I

Speaker 2  2:03:24
my friends and collaborate, my friends and partners and friends, my my peers,

Unknown Speaker  2:03:37
my colleagues, my i

Speaker 1  2:03:49
The People who walked close with Me, you could say, I

Matthias Miller  2:05:02
Okay, then what's the bold explosion? The lesson?

Unknown Speaker  2:05:15
Well, earlier it was about, I

Speaker 1  2:05:16
think this is, this is the bold, but I don't like the got the taste of serving others with I found, I found the 100 booth

Unknown Speaker  2:05:33
version myself. Right, right.

Matthias Miller  2:05:43
Well, I mean, kind of sort of because we're talking about the real self pillar, but

Unknown Speaker  2:05:55
I was, I was, I mean, maybe this is where you say the 100 proof.

Speaker 1  2:06:14
Okay, okay, so something, Dallas said I was listening today. He said, Why Jesus talks about like, Hey, if you're my friends, you'll like, If you love me, you you'll obey my commands. And it's not like he's setting up this rule. It's more like love is what you keep, what keeps you,

Unknown Speaker  2:06:54
ooh and

Speaker 1  2:06:55
so what if the connection is what keeps you until you find your real self, right until you until the until, until the 100 proof you love. The connection with your real self is what keeps you until that part flourishes. Oh.

Unknown Speaker  2:07:20
Ah, it's like it keeps you grounded,

Matthias Miller  2:07:34
right? But I mean, this is, this is not

Unknown Speaker  2:07:40
grounds your identity,

Unknown Speaker  2:07:47
watermelon juice.

Unknown Speaker  2:07:52
This is not how I want to say it, but I need,

Speaker 1  2:07:56
I need the I have zero proof right now.

Unknown Speaker  2:07:59
I need zero truth? This is empty,

Unknown Speaker  2:08:11
okay, I mean, this is,

Unknown Speaker  2:08:22
I don't know.

Speaker 1  2:08:22
I Okay, what if you talk about, it's not about, um, more than my my work, my talent and my book, blah. It's like I found what uniquely made me make what made me unique, or what I found my uniqueness, my uniqueness, and maybe this is where you say it's not just it's always there, right, but appreciation for it, right? And what you place value in what you're grateful for. I

Speaker 1  2:09:29
I felt gratitude. I felt great. I felt gratitude for who I was, right. You're not having to compare yourself against other people or compete against other Okay, here's here's your quote. This is one of my favorite quotes from Naval escape competition through authentic. City, so we

Unknown Speaker  2:10:04
were not going to bring up competition again.

Unknown Speaker  2:10:07
Ah, yeah, you're right.

Unknown Speaker  2:10:11
I found it. I,

Unknown Speaker  2:10:17
I, I

Matthias Miller  2:10:20
finally felt it was like to be accepted for who I uniquely was.

Speaker 1  2:10:31
I think it's more like I finally accepted myself for who I uniquely

Matthias Miller  2:10:35
was. I finally accepted myself who I uniquely

Unknown Speaker  2:10:43
was,

Matthias Miller  2:11:02
and then there could be this, okay, can I kill this? Yeah, and then there's this,

Matthias Miller  2:11:16
like we did earlier, kind of proof point. I

Unknown Speaker  2:11:25
I'm gonna have to dive and dive. You can dive. I mean, I can talk for like 10 minutes if we got something to talk about.

Matthias Miller  2:11:41
I think I have a relatively open day tomorrow, so we have another two hours to wrap it all up. I think I really well it's could be more like three. I'm really pushing pretty hard to

Unknown Speaker  2:12:02
I mean,

Matthias Miller  2:12:06
I mean, this is way tighter. It's crazy. This

Speaker 1  2:12:09
is, this is worlds apart. That's why I felt like we need a week like it, it will only get better. But, I mean, maybe you don't eat a week now. Well, my,

Matthias Miller  2:12:23
my question still remains, path to cash.

Speaker 1  2:12:33
I thought, I thought the the manifesto critique made a lot of sense, which

Speaker 3  2:12:40
means we can get it out tomorrow. The issue we issue

Speaker 1  2:12:44
is, I wouldn't release this to all three communities at once. I'd pick one.

Unknown Speaker  2:12:53
Perry would be the most obvious one.

Speaker 1  2:12:55
What Tim Francis has a great illustration. He's like, you don't want to build Three Gumball Machines at once. You want to build one so you learn you can iterate, right? And then you can do, you know how to do the others, like.

Matthias Miller  2:13:18
So would you completely buzz LinkedIn?

Speaker 1  2:13:22
Oh, no, you can do LinkedIn. I'm just talking about your community. Perry, reach Peter, what's name? Pete Vargas. Pete Vargas, thank you, right. It's on the referral sheet. It's on spreadsheet.

Unknown Speaker  2:13:47
How are testimonials?

Unknown Speaker  2:13:51
Point out I need to

Unknown Speaker  2:13:55
Brian testimonials, see if any New shooter,

Unknown Speaker  2:14:03

Unknown Speaker  2:14:19
