Unknown Speaker  00:50
Good morning.

Unknown Speaker  00:51
Hey, good morning. Drew, how are you doing?

Unknown Speaker  00:54
Doing? Well. Mark you. Pretty good.

Unknown Speaker  01:14
We're looking forward to

Speaker 1  01:19
my mom coming up for the week. The weekend. So, yeah,

Speaker 2  01:28
it's kind of a is your your dad is isn't in the best health anymore? Is he not able to travel? Or no,

Unknown Speaker  01:34
he's not. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  01:38
yeah, it's

Speaker 1  01:40
health has declined significantly over the last, over the past few years. So there's, there's a wild end where it was even tough for tough for my mom to to kind of get away. So he's, he's generally over the last, over the last year, he's generally been, been better than before. But yeah, morning Seth,

Unknown Speaker  02:01
morning. Mark,

Unknown Speaker  02:02
Good Morning, morning. So,

Speaker 2  02:05
Seth, you're, you're close by your grandparents there, right?

Speaker 3  02:09
Yeah, about a mile and a 10th or so,

Speaker 2  02:15
yeah, Dwayne. Dwayne told me the other day that they're celebrating his grandma's 100th birthday later this Wow,

Unknown Speaker  02:26
that's impressive.

Speaker 2  02:29
Well, I don't know. It didn't sound like she thought it's all that impressive, like, well, she just, she said, though one of the hardest things is all the people that she knew that she grew up with, all her friends, she's outlived all of them, so

Unknown Speaker  02:47
she's hanging out with young spirits,

Unknown Speaker  02:51
the younger 90 year olds.

Speaker 1  02:55
Well, I mean, at that age, you could, you pretty easily get into a one to two generation gap.

Unknown Speaker  03:00
It's true. Yeah,

Speaker 1  03:04
think about how much, how much generations have changed, at least from, I mean, maybe they haven't quite hit the acceleration of change as some of the younger generations have, but be daunting if you think about being, being in that age and having had lifetime friendships and looking to rebuild, not sure who's going to be in it for the long haul,

Unknown Speaker  03:30
Just get on social media

Unknown Speaker  03:32
that'll solve everything. Yes, so like,

Speaker 2  03:45
Isn't isn't that what part of what this was, Jason Saul from jet strike was saying that, Oh, this is quite a while back. I asked him about the the whole Metaverse thing, and he said he thinks a lot of people are going to go for that, because he said there's a lot of unhappy people in the world. It's like, you, we didn't talk about a lot, but like, I think his thought was there, you kind of build your own fantasy world empire or whatever.

Speaker 1  04:29
Yeah, the I find, I find human nature fascinating, because while we we decry the metaverse. We have a long history of people escaping into work, religion, church, all kinds of other, other places as an escape for so that they don't actually have to. Friend reality, yeah, that's true. So we just, we just have new, more addictive ways to do it, sadly, not sadly, somehow

Speaker 4  05:12
feels less productive. You know, the other escapes might actually feel a little bit productive,

Speaker 2  05:19
yeah? Yeah, yeah, it's that's true. It's going to make the it seems like figuring out what is truth is going to be really hard, or is harder than ever, like the ability to just like that, that video that showed us that a guy created where Trump was talking about this Mennonite church like it looks so real. Yeah,

Speaker 1  05:53
I have a friend. I have a friend of mine who's consults with a lot of corporations on AI, and he's been saying that for a year. I think his biggest surprise has not been that he was accurate, but how, how quickly it's been happening. But it is a, it is an increasingly big problem of I mean, trust is going to be, I think, I think trust and ways to verify trust, whether that's through, you know, I don't know the full implications of it, but in person, events, referrals, the networks that you have, the people that you literally know, I think, are Going to substantially increase in value, right result. But, I mean, there's also a thing circulate, circulating social media recently about Kamala Harris and this big crowd of people waiting to greet her coming off the airplane. And it was really poorly done. It could have it could have been photoshopped, not AI, but there's no reason why, with the tools that we have, there's no reason why there was any question in anybody's mind whether it was real, like somebody could have made it look real.

Speaker 2  07:12
So was so poorly dominant, it's

Unknown Speaker  07:16
obvious. Yeah.

Speaker 1  07:18
Look like there was an issue with, well, okay, I mean, one of the issues challenges with AI is, I mean, you have to have a good model. The biggest thing is hands. Hands are really tricky to render, yeah,

Speaker 1  07:37
because hands, because, I mean, it's, it's for whatever reason. So it's not uncommon to get people with, you know, extra fingers, or too few, or whatever. Getting the right number of fingers in the right places is a challenge.

Speaker 3  07:53
But the guy, one of our pastors, had a sermon at our church recently in one of the pictures he had in his slideshow, just sort of as a background picture, like, Oh, my word that has to be. Ai, one guy had three fingers, one guy had six it's just the faces were barely faces. It was just really bad. Ai,

Speaker 1  08:13
funny. The Kamala Harris photo, we gave it away. Was the reflection in the in the airplane, the jet, people weren't weren't reflected in there. It was reflecting an empty, empty tarmac. So, I mean, so that one was pretty obvious, but the small amount of data that you actually need to replicate, replicate someone in video and images is

Speaker 2  08:43
now the skeptical side of me asks the question, like in that case, so how do we know that that it wasn't a Republican that created that to make it look shy, they like to make

Unknown Speaker  08:58
exactly

Speaker 2  09:00
was it somebody in her team trying to prop up her campaign?

Speaker 1  09:06
Exactly me? Neither party, in my opinion, is exactly prove themselves to be above board in everything that they're doing. So yes and yes,

Speaker 2  09:21
yeah. Good. Well, should we jump into our agenda? Sounds good. So I feel like we don't have a ton of new things added, or a lot of things. So maybe you have some things that'll lead to longer discussions. But I'm also, if we get done early, then that's, that's fine as well. We've got lots of other things to do so, so the first three items, what I've titled big projects. Are from last time. I thought there was a yeah, those three are from last time. So I think those just all we really need is a quick update on where those are at and if there's any questions. So I'd say, just

Unknown Speaker  10:20
to start from the top.

Speaker 1  10:23
We had, I'm trying to remember where we left. Number one, I thought we had a solution, and I started digging into it, and it looked more complicated than I thought, and I had it in the back of my head that Seth had sent you some information on what we need to do. And then I'm looking back and I'm like, I don't think I ever, we ever talked about that. I i think so if you get time after the call, let's maybe just see about peer programming blocking out some time and peer programming that,

Speaker 3  10:56
yeah, I have, I should have space. Okay, the next one should be done.

Unknown Speaker  11:06
I think, Okay.

Speaker 1  11:08
Was that? Was that? Is that? Did you code it last week or this week?

Speaker 3  11:12
I think, well, let me check. I think I did last week. Well, for some reason, whenever I come back in the morning, I can't get into client scope until I reboot, and I don't want to reboot right now. So glad

Unknown Speaker  11:32
I'm not the only one who has that issue. Do

Unknown Speaker  11:34
you have the same problem?

Unknown Speaker  11:36
Yeah, but I've always blamed it because I've got a Mac and

Speaker 3  11:39
virtual machine. I definitely don't have a Mac or a virtual machine, so you should complain about it. Yeah, fixed it just started in the last week or two for me, anyway, so I'm not quite sure I Well, let me I think I emailed Matthias a little bit about it. I can see I bait. I think I did it either on Friday or Saturday. When was yes? Update, Saturday? What time Saturday? I don't know. 435, 435970,

Speaker 2  12:29
well, I mean, is it safe to is it more true? You could, you could recreate the issue. So if it works, or should we just

Speaker 4  12:38
Yeah, well, here's my report. There's nothing on that report of unpaid invoices in accounting that you attend to me.

Unknown Speaker  12:49
So okay,

Speaker 3  12:53
I think it's should be in live already. I had, I know I had it coded by about noon Saturday, but I'm having trouble seeing exactly when

Speaker 1  13:13
we had but there was one remaining issue on that I

Speaker 3  13:20
made the change you said to make, but that, I think it'll still include lines for non po purchases.

Unknown Speaker  13:37
Po purchases,

Speaker 1  13:42
well, that's fine, excuse me, that's fine because those lines are what pushes it to AP. So I think, I think we're good,

Unknown Speaker  14:00
that is so we'll expect and

Speaker 1  14:03
they'll also get cleaned up when we clean up the consolidate the types,

Speaker 2  14:11
because so if we'll consider it fixed, and then if it, if the issue surfaces, You'll see it, and you'll let Yeah, if nothing, it would run into an issue. Yeah, if,

Speaker 4  14:27
if I gave tabs on this report that should let me know if there's anything like that, would this report still function the same way, and it would still give me a valid list if there is something that's looking through,

Speaker 1  14:45
which which report is, oh, the is the report that we made for you. Yeah,

Speaker 4  14:50
just last week. It's 20, 2408 22 unpaid vis and accountants.

Unknown Speaker  14:58
Yes, it. It should,

Unknown Speaker  15:03
yeah, I'll go

Unknown Speaker  15:04
down. Okay.

Speaker 2  15:09
So three updates to vendor, invoices, meeting, payments, paid. So Drew, and I have not looked at that yet and then, but I don't think that keeps us from working on creating the remittance, even though so any any updates on on that?

Speaker 1  15:35
No Seth that I dropped the ball in that Seth was asking for specs, and I did not get it To him,

Unknown Speaker  15:43
so let's see.

Speaker 2  16:00
So four is a new did you have anything else on three guys?

Unknown Speaker  16:19
I am I and

Speaker 1  16:26
so this is going to be a separate, separate report vendor invoices recently paid versus needing payment. And it will, yeah,

Speaker 4  16:41
I think were you going to put it as a third

Unknown Speaker  16:46
box

Speaker 4  16:50
or something, or was that the more developed? Like there was going to be a lower right pain that was going to show all the stuff you paid something like

Speaker 1  17:00
I was going to wait to use that space for when you're generating e payments, yeah, so that those e pending e payments can show up before they're executed. And I think this is just a temporary report anyway, that once, once we have E payments, right, mostly goes away. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  17:19
that's true, so report would be just fine, too.

Unknown Speaker  17:34
All right, deleting i

Unknown Speaker  17:44
right?

Speaker 1  17:52
Let me see what that permission is, user, group, administration, accounting. I'm confused about how you guys have your permission set up, because there's an accounting admin group that's got a lot of people with, if Francine and Whitney, I guess, would be the main ones who have access to that

Speaker 2  18:20
Whitney, Whitney, um, Francine, you're saying, Yeah, she does. I don't know. Does she she does rent to own contracts the bourbon for purple. Man, I don't know. Does she need that?

Unknown Speaker  18:40
Finally let us

Speaker 1  18:49
go away. I think what permission would be appropriate here. I mean, we could just limit it to Administrator type users, which probably would be fine, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  19:11
let's just do that here. Let's

Unknown Speaker  19:20
do

Unknown Speaker  19:23
and there's also a i

Unknown Speaker  19:47
that deposit that he deleted

Unknown Speaker  19:49
account, which

Unknown Speaker  19:50
is, do we not want to just

Speaker 3  19:52
add, prevent deleted, referenced or not, like I said,

Unknown Speaker  19:57
just broke its new. Eric,

Unknown Speaker  20:00
when I went to

Unknown Speaker  20:02
That's right, oh,

Speaker 4  20:07
right, right. And the new one is like, Oh, this amount of missing and what there is, so

Unknown Speaker  20:13
there really was not far.

Speaker 1  20:22
Um, um So Drew. Which payment methods are you having trouble modifying? Is it? Is it the new ones, or is it

Speaker 4  20:31
what I'm actually wanting to do is I want to make the um financing fee, financial premium and customer underpayment to be the same as that adjustment for, like, basically put that adjustment for in front of them so They're a little bit more intuitive.

Unknown Speaker  20:55
Okay,

Unknown Speaker  20:59
so, yes,

Speaker 4  21:05
like I set the I can set the name when I create a new one.

Speaker 3  21:10
These are, this is, these are ones we define on the software side.

Speaker 1  21:16
So somewhere we've got special handling for them, like that,

Unknown Speaker  21:23
true, yeah,

Speaker 4  21:24
like that. And then the customer underpay. I think it's underpayment as well

Speaker 1  21:31
that one, that one says adjustment for customer. You said customer

Unknown Speaker  21:38
underpayment down just a little bit. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  21:43
That one you can Okay,

Speaker 1  21:53
I don't remember specifically why we've got special handling for the financing fee and premium, but we do. So there you go. Needed them. It

Speaker 2  22:05
was easy. So this is an easy update that Seth can do that does, does this need to go through an update cycle? Yes, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  22:16
but it's about five minutes of work. Okay?

Speaker 2  22:21
Um, deleting deposit records you're saying. Have we resolved that? How are we resolving that

Speaker 1  22:31
if you have administrator privileges in the system, which means that or you are a administrator, administrative administrative type user with accounting. I mean, I think we also lock down by accounting privileges. I don't know for sure, but that would mean that Whitney would be able to delete them. Because, for some reason, and I don't know why, she's an administrator,

Speaker 2  22:58
I think all the people that are listed there are that's fine if they can, if they can,

Unknown Speaker  23:05
my witness, basically, not even anything.

Speaker 1  23:12
No, I guess the question is to, well, I don't know that this works, though. Can I just ask why. Like, this seems like overkill to have 36 administrators.

Speaker 2  23:30
Well, like, okay, and that's we're also, I think our our monthly billing is based on users. So we have, this was something I was going to bring up to Josh, but we have a lot of people here that some people that are no longer with the company that should be,

Speaker 3  23:51
I don't know, should be removed. It can be deactivated, then it shouldn't

Speaker 2  23:54
So what happens if we just deactivate them? They

Speaker 1  23:58
just won't be able to log in if they were to try which, I mean, I think

Unknown Speaker  24:04
not with the company anymore, would seem reasonable.

Speaker 1  24:06
It would seem reasonable. I would just if it were me in your shoes, Daniel, or Leanne, or whoever handles the exit process somewhere, there's an exit process where you shut down the email accounts and lock them out of the company. And part of that process should be, go close out their accounts. But somebody like Daniel or whoever should should be it can just go through and deactivate, just hit account disabled.

Speaker 2  24:36
Now could, could you create a report that one thing that would help is if you could put together a report that shows user activity, like all the all the active accounts, yeah, when they last, probably when they last.

Speaker 1  24:57
Let's do this, user profile, user. Necessarily

Speaker 2  25:00
all in well, there's a lot of people outside of purple management, so it'd be helpful, though, ideally, just by oldest, whatever, like,

Unknown Speaker  25:20
oh, no, this won't work, because these guys don't we would need to have A audit.

Unknown Speaker  25:38
Yeah, that's

Speaker 1  25:41
what I was thinking. NDX, I I don't even know show

Unknown Speaker  25:44
less common my help. Oh,

Speaker 5  25:47
thank you. You're welcome. Audit user,

Speaker 1  25:56
new field, no, let's use that's literally the user file. That's level. I don't think we have anything for it'd be surprising that sorts first by user. I mean, that's good. Well, we can also do a model. We could do a here. Let's do this new model activity, and this would be maxed, and this would be activity date. And I mean, this is going to be ridiculously slow if we do it like this, it would have to be something

Speaker 3  26:39
like and you NDX on a date range or not. Do we not have any first by date? Do to get a range from just this year or something,

Speaker 1  26:50
or even the last 6090, days or something like that? Audit date nd X find still level first, though it's still level first audit ID, you could do an ID, but everything's

Unknown Speaker  27:04
level first.

Speaker 1  27:08
Oh, okay, well, Seth could give you a report. I mean, could pretty easily, it would require an update, but could pretty easily give you a report where we get the this would be a great use of totals to record totals.

Speaker 3  27:26
I don't want to add record totals. I don't like the slowdown they can potentially have. Fair enough. I mean, they're all cool, but sorry, go ahead

Speaker 2  27:37
if we just use the land login date that would like, what are we missing if we

Speaker 1  27:43
people, like the fax users? Oh, but we can group by people, with effect, go ahead,

Speaker 2  27:54
I think just if you could just sort by last login date, and then that would put all the people like Aaron and those at the top of the bottom, I think that would be there's a handful that we could probably

Speaker 1  28:17
I love taking I love taking things like This and take them, the monthly fee multiplied by 12, divided by the amount of time that you took it, and that's pretty good return on investment for effort invested.

Speaker 2  28:32
You're saying like the amount that Apple's like the charge for

Speaker 1  28:38
if you if you spend 10 minutes saving, saving $1,000 a year, that's a $6,000 in our task, you should go do it.

Speaker 2  28:51
Sure. Yeah, just if you send me that report, that's that's fine. That's all I need. Like, do

Speaker 1  28:56
you just want a PDF of it? Or no, send

Speaker 2  29:00
me an Excel Sure. Alright, and inactivating them is is the correct thing to do, like inactivating won't delete anything. Won't cause any it'll leave everything intact, and they just can't log in anymore. Am I correct that that will that if we, if we cut, if we inactivate, 20 that would like on our monthly invoice from Apple, correct

Speaker 1  29:38
the all the CCI users are excluded, so you don't have to worry about sure about those, okay, although realistically you could actually, I'll just go ahead and do this. Audra really doesn't need access to this anymore. I.

Unknown Speaker  30:02
Cool.

Speaker 2  30:04
So okay, we were talking about deleting deposit records, and we went off on which I think this was good.

Unknown Speaker  30:14
Where were we

Unknown Speaker  30:15
going with that? As far as deposit records, we were I

Speaker 2  30:24
so you're saying deleting a reconciled deposit is a permissions level thing?

Unknown Speaker  30:34
Yes, go ahead

Speaker 2  30:35
that the reason Dwayne was able to delete it was because of his user level.

Speaker 1  30:40
Well, Seth, do you want to, can you usually look up the deletion rule for, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  30:46
those are assist deposits, right?

Unknown Speaker  30:48
Yes, sure.

Unknown Speaker  31:19
Them, a whole track.

Speaker 3  31:24
It looks like right now? Well, the can delete, says link ones with Link payments can't be deleted. That's about all I'm seeing.

Unknown Speaker  31:38
How did he

Unknown Speaker  31:43
is there something wrong with the logic to get link payments?

Speaker 2  31:49
You're saying that should be in place regardless of the user level, like you'd have to get, yeah,

Speaker 3  31:55
that's what this is. I mean, that's what it's trying to do anyway. I

Speaker 2  31:59
don't know. Can you see modification history? What happened when he it was earlier this week, I want to say Tuesday, at like 1010, 30. He was taken late. He was trying to make an update. So he deleted the deposit record 623, and then just recreated a new deposit record type that I

Unknown Speaker  32:23
Okay, so here

Speaker 1  32:28
we had deposit ID, then we would also be looking for activity history for the sales order. Where the old, you know the new value? Sort of the new value modified field, the So, payment positive ID. Let's go find where this was set.

Speaker 5  33:00
So let's also go find where this thing was cleared.

Speaker 3  33:33
Oh, if the sales order didn't have a where is it didn't have a payment date. Well, I mean, would you expect that to have a payment date? Yeah, yeah. If it wouldn't have a payment date, then it would, the whole logic would return a blank string. But that doesn't

Unknown Speaker  34:01
Okay. So here's where. Why did we do it like this? Okay, here's where I modified. I took it, cleared off, deposit, three. LinkedIn, down to another row or something. And then Dwayne linked created a new 145,

Speaker 1  34:39
so we have it. It was sales order hanging out with an invalid deposit ID.

Speaker 3  34:44
Is it? Did you check for Didn't you just look at new value or not?

Speaker 1  34:54
Yeah, and that's where he blanked it out on a notable report. You're right. I. I'm not sure why you created a new one instead of just changing the deposit, indeed, but

Speaker 2  35:06
wow, he was taken look, deleted the deposit and then just recreate. And then said, Oh, the only way to fix my mistake is to create a new deposit and then buy the payment to

Speaker 1  35:28
you. Yeah, there we go. He blinked it out, then he said it again. So the real question was, though, why was he Seth, do you have the expression? Can you send over the expression?

Speaker 2  35:57
Yeah. The real question is, why was he able to delete the deposit record, I think, like this has all been fixed, right? DREW This specific one has all been fixed. Reconcile the way I understand that.

Unknown Speaker  36:13
You know what? I have an idea. I'll bet you this thing's No, let's even better. I

Speaker 5  36:40
Where's it like this?

Unknown Speaker  36:51
Okay, we grab the

Unknown Speaker  37:02
um.

Unknown Speaker  37:09
The test system is showing

Unknown Speaker  37:10
that it would block

Unknown Speaker  37:20
you. Okay, activity history on that sales order

Unknown Speaker  37:25
from the live system.

Unknown Speaker  37:26
Yeah, from the live system. So the

Unknown Speaker  37:34
two things we'd be looking for would be payment date and yeah, and potentially deposit ID

Unknown Speaker  37:44
payment date is blank. Is that one?

Unknown Speaker  37:46
No? Because here it's subsequently set, somebody added a new row. But the other thing that could do is the payment, deposit ID,

Unknown Speaker  38:03
all right, well,

Speaker 1  38:06
on the 30th Hazel removed it from the deposit at 1036 at 1038 she added it again.

Unknown Speaker  38:20
When did

Speaker 1  38:34
eight? Hang on, this would be too crazy if this were actually true. 827, 1035,

Speaker 3  38:40
those are different months. No,

Speaker 1  38:43
completely different. Okay, so it would have been present in 35

Speaker 3  38:54
Wait, once he or he unlinked it from the and then deleted it. Oh,

Speaker 1  39:00
it is not everything's working. Oh, he, he unlinked the deposit, deleted the unlink the sales order, deleted the deposit. Got it. He went like, two and six, one, but okay, yeah,

Speaker 3  39:15
so he tried to delete, got the message, went and unlinked it, deleted it. Or maybe that's my hypothesis. Looks like it

Speaker 4  39:23
tended to do something else while it was unhooked and accidentally deleted it. But

Speaker 2  39:28
should we, should we allow unlinking it? Is that situation for you? It's like so this deposit was reconciled. Should we allow unlinking it?

Speaker 4  39:40
Yeah, because if it was the wrong payment, you know, like there were two payments for $500 and somebody accidentally hit the wrong one, and this one over here, never, we never, actually something was wrong with the one we selected, or something. So

Speaker 2  39:57
after looking at this. And in depth, we we discover that it's, it's all working just like we like it's supposed to.

Speaker 1  40:06
The The only exception is Steph. Do we have the accounting impact effects reconciled transaction checks and on deposits?

Unknown Speaker  40:18
I don't remember. Let me check. Do? Act,

Unknown Speaker  40:34
check. I

Speaker 4  40:36
mean, it really should function the same way as those under invoices. Yeah, we do.

Speaker 1  40:46
So okay, but then that wouldn't have happened, though this would have gotten unlinked on the sales order side. Yeah, there's some limitations. As far as the warning with modifying reconciled deposit records. So I don't know how much you care, but

Unknown Speaker  41:10
what is the what would you do to improve it?

Unknown Speaker  41:18
I think I

Speaker 1  41:25
when you modify a sales order,

Speaker 1  41:41
you would have to off the cap. I would say you'd have to go hunt down the deposit records and see if the deposit records are linked to any

Speaker 1  41:59
reconciled transactions, and that lets you change the

Unknown Speaker  42:05
No. I

Speaker 2  42:06
mean, are you? Are you? You see a reason to make this more robust than what it is.

Unknown Speaker  42:19
I don't know. I mean,

Unknown Speaker  42:28
almost feel, I

Unknown Speaker  42:28
don't think it's really worth spending a ton of time on.

Speaker 2  42:34
Then let's, let's leave it as is. If it does become an issue, we'll

Unknown Speaker  42:38
bring it up fair

Speaker 2  42:41
enough, good. So 5b Can we inactivate the checkbox? Option payment is right? Oh, so the only option is easy, is to use the payments RG. Think it might do the same thing, but it's just make it A little less.

Speaker 1  43:06
Can Yes, this is my proposal. Usually,

Speaker 1  43:29
can we lock down any existing payment stuff? Sorry, any existing write offs? Do you want them to be editable?

Speaker 4  43:46
I mean, yeah, I don't think we're quite are we are actually done and good going through all that stuff Well, I

Speaker 1  43:56
mean, at some point we want to migrate it all over. We could just hide the checkbox if it's not checked, which means that you could still uncheck it, and you could still modify the write off reasons and stuff like that.

Speaker 4  44:13
Now, doesn't the checkbox thing do the exactly same, isn't it? The same function as just in the payment RG line typing in that, here's my write off, and it's this amount and so and so. Yes,

Speaker 1  44:28
the issue was that we was to really completely get rid of it, which is the right thing to do. We would need to migrate all of the historical write off roads to new new rose. And I basically called an audible on it and said, Yeah, I should be spending my time on that.

Speaker 4  44:58
Yeah. So. So we could maybe do something like, once we've closed out this year, then go ahead and just lock all that down and not like, can we, could we get rid of it at a point without migrating them when we're ready to say we're not changing anything,

Speaker 1  45:22
or isn't that you're okay losing history on the sales order, about write offs?

Unknown Speaker  45:28
Is that what it would be?

Speaker 1  45:31
I mean, you could check activity history, but nothing on the sales order would indicate that you had a write off anymore.

Speaker 2  45:41
So what you're one option you're suggesting is just basically inactivated or hide it on all sales orders, all, all sales orders, unless, unless they do, unless they have a check then, then show it and make it the editable, correct. So, so that would mean moving forward, nobody would ever use it. Yeah, they wouldn't use

Speaker 4  46:11
the check box. But the the RG line has the same options, and you could type it in. It

Speaker 2  46:16
would force them for all new ones, it would force them to use the the RG line. But for old ones that have the check box there, it would allow them to to use it and edit it.

Speaker 4  46:26
Well, it wouldn't force them to correctly use what. What we're trying to get them away from is putting it right off in the same line as the paint, and we want them to use a new line. So we can't get rid of the inline option, but we can hide the quick and easy checkbox. Way of creating that inline option,

Unknown Speaker  46:56
well here, I mean, you can simply say here, let's do another sales orders.

Speaker 1  47:17
I mean, this checkbox can become disabled if it's never checked, or hidden, really hidden if it's not checked. So the only issue is, anything where you have an existing write off, people can change the date and the amount and the reason, and they could disable the write off. Or we could say the only thing you could ever do is take a write off, off and and you can't change the date and amount of the reason. And so if you have to fix it, then you're gonna have to add a new row with the new date the amount in the payment

Speaker 4  47:54
method. I like that. That would work. Yeah. Further to the right, yeah, to the right. There's options to just put it in the line like this is that's all the same as as the write off box down here. This is a quick and easy way. You just enter it down here and it throws it in.

Speaker 2  48:13
And you're saying to to do this correctly, we also need to do to inactivate the functionality up here.

Unknown Speaker  48:22
It would automatically

Speaker 3  48:25
saying that you would just disable the checkbox. From now on, would never be you can never check it if it's unchecked. And that would that would work for both of them, yes, and so you wouldn't actually be able to add new ones to existing lines.

Speaker 4  48:45
Oh, it's the same track. It is okay, got it. Got it.

Speaker 2  48:51
So the only thing you can do with these is existing ones where it's checked, you can uncheck it. That's all you can after this change. That would be all you could do.

Unknown Speaker  49:01
Correct. Okay,

Speaker 4  49:02
good, yeah, I didn't realize that was the same, the same check mark function there,

Speaker 1  49:10
yeah, um, so we'll leave a back door so that Dwayne needs their eye or Seth, or somebody needs to create an editable report to go clean it

Speaker 3  49:17
up that we said I was just going to ask, do you care if there's that back door,

Speaker 1  49:21
no, that's, yeah, we are planning that. Okay,

Speaker 3  49:26
so I was just working with ISI, so I'm currently thinking very locked down everything as much as possible. Now I'm coming back to the SPS

Speaker 1  49:36
we have, we do not have that advanced users who will create editable reports to get around it. We keep them too busy to get them to you.

Unknown Speaker  49:49
They're not that advanced either.

Speaker 1  49:53
All right, so that's easy. I like it good.

Speaker 2  49:58
Is that a quick. Change as well. Just for an idea of size, okay, hour,

Speaker 3  50:06
half a day, 15 minutes. Yeah, 15 minutes.

Speaker 2  50:16
So Revised Standard cost percentage. This is more a question than anything else. Back on 612 I think I had an email where we from you, Matthias, where you talked about this giving, drew a way to revise standard cost percentage for historically built buildings.

Unknown Speaker  50:40
Might even have actually run through how to do it.

Speaker 2  50:43
My question was, just, is that functionality? Did we build that functionality then or not?

Speaker 1  50:55
Standard percentage settings as well as the values on No, we didn't standardize it. It was just a one off. Okay,

Speaker 2  51:03
you You did it as a one off. And then I think somewhere later, you asked the question whether we want to create a standard report, which I don't think it's, I

Speaker 1  51:22
don't remember how it works, but there's something here.

Speaker 2  51:27
See what happens. This is your one off, right? Yeah, okay. The chances of ever needing that are relatively small, and if we do, then I'd say we could, could come to you and ask for this again, but it's okay, then we're going to say no standard report and no need for one, okay, for the sake of time, I think seven. We talked about that already, but that's a nice to have. It's not, let's ignore that. I mean, it takes a bit of your time to it, but not major the raw materials and

Speaker 4  52:12
selling itself, yeah. So that could actually just go on the paper cut thing, maybe. So

Unknown Speaker  52:22
then paper cut projects or things like add sales order notes to this report. Except, you know, do

Unknown Speaker  52:34
you know what needs to happen here?

Speaker 3  52:39
I mean, if it's just adding sales order notes, then it, it's, what are the it's those, okay, so it'd be by date you're getting the two most recent, just concatenating over the line, or what,

Speaker 2  52:53
I think we have go to that demons aging report and and open, also open a modification instrument

Unknown Speaker  53:05
of on a building. This is, it's still

Unknown Speaker  53:18
so, but Dwayne said it's sales order notes or so notes?

Speaker 2  53:29
Yeah, we had some that, obviously this one, yeah, that's it, just the last two sets of notes.

Speaker 1  53:39
So the last two, the last two lines in the oh,

Speaker 2  53:48
well, okay, but we also have, okay, the notes were showing,

Unknown Speaker  53:54
oh, this is a different report. Never

Speaker 2  53:58
mind. We want to keep the payments note, payment notes and add the sales order notes, because it's helpful to diagnose.

Speaker 3  54:06
I think it's you're in the wrong report then. But wait, this is the undefended staging. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  54:17
and the positive deposit got

Speaker 1  54:21
it. We have the payment notes here, and the sales order notes, most recent two dates. Okay, um, well, I mean, Seth, I would just do a list, the pipe list, remove blanks and grab the last two lines. We don't, I mean, it's okay if it's not formatted right. Just

Speaker 3  54:47
so there would you want notes on why this was removed and or is it you want the whole thing there?

Speaker 2  54:58
I. So here we have two sets of notes, like, Uh huh. But here we would want both of them. Now some of them we have, like, 10 or 15 sets of notes, but like, I would count this as Leanne's set of notes was the most reason, and then second most reason was Hazel's notes. That's what we want to show there.

Speaker 1  55:22
Let's just, let's just throw this in there and see this is what you what you're looking for.

Speaker 5  55:38
Remove links from pipe list, and then

Speaker 2  55:45
how much? How much harder is it to learn to write this code than it is to do formulas and spreadsheets? Is it the difference between riding a bike and a unicycle or

Unknown Speaker  55:57
that's not good.

Speaker 1  56:01
I think, I mean, Dwayne, and Dwayne did a two hour session with us, something and somewhere. If you ask Tim or Ben or even Dwayne, maybe you could probably hunt down the recording of it where we just walked through a lot of the basics. But I mean syntactically. The biggest thing with this in formulas is you can, you can save variables, which is an assigned variable, name equals, and then the expression, and then, and then. The other thing is just learning all the different function names. So I wouldn't say it's I don't know. I never learned to ride a unicycle, so I can't

Unknown Speaker  56:50
neither did I.

Speaker 3  56:56
There's also just a big difference between the Duane level and a Matthias level's

Unknown Speaker  57:09
down wires.

Speaker 1  57:16
Okay, so these will not be don't have the bold labels, but this grabs the last two lines in here,

Speaker 3  57:22
although, if someone has a if someone would have a multi line note, then we would not get all of it. But there's just nothing we can do about that. Not grabbing it from a memo like this,

Speaker 2  57:39
what you have here is fine. So this also, yeah, this is a standard, is this a standard report?

Unknown Speaker  57:46
Uh, yes,

Speaker 2  57:48
it is now, okay. So this would need to go through an update.

Unknown Speaker  57:54
It's another, like, 10 minute change. It's hard.

Speaker 1  58:00
I'm doing all obsessed figure out, if anything, well,

Speaker 3  58:05
I still I need to find control C and V on my keyboard, and then I'm good to go.

Unknown Speaker  58:12
I'll send you a picture of where they are. Like, he sounds good.

Speaker 2  58:18
I think the next one falls into the same category. The AR report is adding a day's outstanding column,

Speaker 1  58:32
which is today minus, well, it's the as of date minus the invoice date. Yep. I mean, Seth, I think you can, I mean, I think it's clear enough. In the there's, there's an as of date as prompt, it's just invoice date. I think it's pretty clear from the instructions, good. Also, in other

Speaker 2  58:54
words, starting with, okay, we're already sorting by invoice date. So, yeah, good. Yeah.

Speaker 3  59:00
What's the priority on things like this? Is this, I'm trying to figure out how to prioritize. Basically, let

Speaker 1  59:11
me throw out my proposal and then mark and drew. You guys can weigh in my proposal is so you've got, you can talk to your dad about exactly where this is at, but you got a certain number of hours, zfp, hours every month. Yeah, what I would do is I would black out half a day a week, or something, or like 1010, to 15% maybe of that time, just to knock out these things. Sure. That

Unknown Speaker  59:37
gives me an idea.

Unknown Speaker  59:40
Mark and drew. Does that sound good to you guys?

Speaker 2  59:44
Yeah, I would say so you're saying blocking out. Are you taking these projects, talking just about the paper cut projects, or about he was

Speaker 3  59:53
saying to block a half a day for most of it, and then 10 or 15% of that time you knock out a few of these small ones. I. Yeah, right. However

Matthias Miller  1:00:01
much time you block out you would spend, okay, using round numbers, I don't know what it is. If you're working a week full time, which I don't know how this all comes out, you would spend four days working on the big projects, and one day on the paper cuts and and you you spend, you get through as much of the big projects in the 80% time as you can, and then in the 20% time, you could work through as many of the paper cut projects as you can. And if you get caught up in paper cut projects, you can fill the rest of your time with big projects but but never spend more than 20% of your time

Unknown Speaker  1:00:37
on paper cut projects. That

Unknown Speaker  1:00:40
seems right is that

Unknown Speaker  1:00:41
the order on the list? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:00:43
we have them prioritized, true,

Speaker 2  1:00:51
good. So three, this is something that maybe this is a not sure. Is this a Josh thing? Currently, it has been this way all along, but it's just something that kind of bugs us, because it seems redundant where so we Yeah, just, let's just look at one kind of injury invoice. Just, we

Unknown Speaker  1:01:22
just find a PO that hasn't been invoiced yet?

Speaker 2  1:01:37
What is something that's real common, like, I don't know which company you're in, but

Speaker 1  1:01:45
let's see. Here is one for so this would be final structures, Danville, okay, and you check the box, good,

Speaker 2  1:01:58
and then it forces you to or it asks you to enter the received quantity again. Is there a reason? Okay, so we already, that's already entered over on the purchase order. Is there a reason we need to to enter it again on the invoice?

Speaker 1  1:02:18
I would, I mean, this lands in Josh territory. I would start with him. Okay, we'll do

Speaker 2  1:02:28
payroll module changes. So I didn't describe this very well, but what I recall was that you were going to write up a this was probably two months ago, a scope on changing, fixing some small like, mostly around properly inactivating former employees. And then we do a quick review, and then go ahead with that. But what, what do you have on that? Or what mean, like I said, I'm going from memory, from quite a while back,

Unknown Speaker  1:03:09
I know I sent, I know I sent a I

Unknown Speaker  1:03:24
employee company history.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:38
So what's the problem?

Unknown Speaker  1:03:41
The problem is that the,

Speaker 2  1:03:47
I mean here you can just problem is that, no, I can't straight face, I was going to say the problem is that that the calculations on payroll module don't, aren't,

Speaker 3  1:04:03
yeah, well, how's your pocketbook doing? Do you want to help fund fixing

Unknown Speaker  1:04:08
it? No, that's not the

Speaker 3  1:04:12
Okay, good. I if I would go back, I would try to force us to go with something simpler, but I think we got it working then,

Speaker 2  1:04:25
yeah, working real. Well, honestly, we, we're doing a bunch of different things every week with different companies, you know, to pay different methods, different ways, and it's, it just works week after week. Well, that's good. It's really kind of boring because it just works. No, that's what

Speaker 3  1:04:46
software's supposed to be. Once it's going hopefully it's boring. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:04:51
that's true. Um,

Unknown Speaker  1:04:52
I don't like that. He's not.

Speaker 1  1:04:55
We have here's, here's an employee with an inactive date. Um. But the context for an comp end date is blank, okay? And so I think we'll just

Speaker 3  1:05:06
add validation that you have to set the end compensation date. Can you not or not? I don't remember.

Speaker 1  1:05:13
There is no the end compensation date calculates from the prior one, so we need to get off the adaptive date. Gotcha, I think that's required.

Speaker 3  1:05:22
It should, okay, yeah, should be pretty easy. I think

Speaker 2  1:05:25
so. One way, one place where we could check this Dwayne is, or is if, if you go to payroll module, the shed, time payroll for this week, the verifications, I think, open up all three of the verification reports for this week. Let's just

Speaker 3  1:05:58
why do we have an exclamation mark is a title for that report.

Speaker 1  1:06:01
I don't know if you want to fix it. You might guess

Speaker 3  1:06:07
why. That does not look like a thing Seth does, but

Speaker 1  1:06:13
it's probably me somewhere, alright, so

Unknown Speaker  1:06:16
somewhere on this report, it's, it's, I think, okay, like this one. I think does Abraham Yoder had no hours like he Okay, he would be one that

Speaker 2  1:06:32
we need to turn inactive or to inactivate. Now, don't we also have employees. There's on this, this prompt or this error,

Speaker 1  1:06:48
yet that the the payroll exceptions report, the shed time, Abraham, Lavon and Paul, which, I think this is all tied together,

Speaker 2  1:07:12
okay, exceptions, takes that appears on these reports that, and it's also okay, it's also creating time cards for these employees, I believe,

Speaker 3  1:07:28
or which, if we, if we do this, the fix, I think the fix is another 10 minute fix, and then I think everything should Just work.

Speaker 2  1:07:39
Okay. Well, let's, I'm going to prioritize this. I would say, Make this number one on the list of priorities, just because it's, it's something that folks just the managers, because they're like, Well, this guy doesn't work here anymore, and he's getting, I'm seeing his name, and he's so

Speaker 3  1:07:57
that should be pretty I mean, it from Matthias is right, and I think he is, then it should be very fast fix and just work. Okay,

Speaker 2  1:08:04
so let's move that up to the very top of the big prize. I'll update my notes after the meeting here and send it out. But sounds

Unknown Speaker  1:08:13
good, good.

Speaker 2  1:08:17
So five was something drew mentioned transactions by contact report. Can we add the available filter by contact on that report? The use type would be where we say, Okay, I want to see everything related to Sherwin, Williams, Danville, or whatever,

Unknown Speaker  1:08:37
just Yeah,

Speaker 3  1:08:39
is the, this is, is the account of the contact stored once on a transaction, or is

Unknown Speaker  1:08:44
it a relaying item? Okay,

Speaker 3  1:08:48
if we don't have, uh, index for them, that better have an index, because I don't like making accounting reports slow. I don't like how slow they already are.

Speaker 4  1:09:00
Well, they are mightily faster than they used to be. I mean, I can actually use the Transaction Search function now, nice, yeah, blazing fast compared to what it used to be. I don't think

Speaker 3  1:09:14
I'm going to be able to do quite that level of speed increase that easily again. But,

Speaker 4  1:09:21
yeah, definitely, definitely worth using now

Unknown Speaker  1:09:26
that's awesome. Also,

Speaker 4  1:09:28
also do the same thing to the cash and credit card transactions report or cash and CC trans, I think what it's called,

Unknown Speaker  1:09:40
yeah, that one.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:53
Okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:09:58
Seth, if you include.

Speaker 1  1:10:07
If you include blank contact items, it was a little weird, but blank contact items, then you can do an NDX, fine, and just using the XL keys, if the s prompt is blank,

Speaker 3  1:10:22
sure I Sure. Is that faster than NDX skip? Oh, India. I think India faster.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:34
I Okay, fine. You win. You. Be better. And then you wouldn't have to include them in the index at all. Your index would be smaller. Okay, look at you. Good.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:54
Must have had good, good teachers.

Speaker 3  1:11:02
That's great. That's not quite fair, but I have access. The whole time I've been working, I've had access to dad, like, not quite all the time, but pretty much. And that's just well or the year, there was one year that I was not but then I had access to Matthias. So I've had an unfair leg up compared to most people

Speaker 2  1:11:23
does. Does your dad still do a lot of development, or is he? No,

Speaker 3  1:11:27
he just does design and management and stuff, but he, I mean, yeah, he's not bad at what he does, and he's not bad at coding either. So

Speaker 2  1:11:41
good. Um, good. And then you were looking at this functionality for notes and attachments on recurring,

Unknown Speaker  1:11:50
yeah, my big question is, these will not be copied over to the vendor invoice, right,

Speaker 4  1:11:56
right? Yeah, it's fine. It's just for, like, proof of why the thing is what it is, you know, I get an email from somebody saying, Hey, make a recurring vendor invoice for this with X dollars to these people for so much and, you know, and that way I have something. If I go back to it, I say, Well, okay, here's why it is set this way. So now I know whether I want to change it,

Speaker 2  1:12:21
oh, you're saying we're on the setup of the you want to be able to say, here's why you started paying, yeah,

Speaker 4  1:12:30
$500 Yeah, yeah, it's, it's only just, it's just for Why is this thing set up here and recurring? So. Seth, nothing to copy over to the actual invoice. It creates Fair enough.

Speaker 1  1:12:50
Seth, what I would do is just create a notes, you know, notes and notes and attachments memo, make sure you allow archive documents and so theoretically, we should push it to s3 sometime, but you and I don't have that capacity, so yeah.

Speaker 3  1:13:11
How are these? I'm still trying to catch up. This is vendor invoice. You're wanting to pull the notes,

Unknown Speaker  1:13:20
just add a memo. That's it. That's

Speaker 3  1:13:24
it. So I'm not trying to keep stuff synced, or anything, or no syncing, no

Speaker 1  1:13:29
nothing from the vendor. Invoice. You can

Speaker 3  1:13:35
why that detail screen is making me feel sad because we have two different header colors and it's just ugly.

Speaker 1  1:13:45
Well, if it's in your heart to fix it, I'm probably to blame in the I mean, just FYI, if I don't know this is too much information, but there's a link from from the vendor invoice back into here. Somebody needs to figure out what's going on.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:12
So sweet, yep.

Speaker 4  1:14:13
Well, that was, Do you have time for more paper cuts? I

Speaker 4  1:14:24
um, we can put them on the list then, but I um, one of them goes back to that thing of the uploads disappearing, my transaction uploads that I had done so Seth, what you figured out on the on that one, I think, is only pertaining to that particular issue.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:48
Okay, I just

Speaker 4  1:14:51
where, where it had the same key, the same Max key, and we wrote over top from a total different transaction. So just. Last night, it was reconciling, and there were again, two payroll sheet uploads that were just totally missing. So I thought, well, I can upload them. If it's a match key issue, it will load on top of the original that was there, and I can see transaction history, yeah, but it created something entirely new. There was no transaction history prior to that on these now, so I don't know. Can you just take the user and just see what kind of uploads this user do, and find out if I actually uploaded it or if I didn't actually upload it sometime prior

Speaker 3  1:15:43
um, if you send me the send me the links to the ones that you just uploaded, I can look at values on there and look and see if you, anytime recently created Something that matches those values that I can do.

Speaker 4  1:16:01
Okay, okay, so I could just send you those sheets that were uploaded. Okay, um, can you add, like, if you open up a reconcile? Um, the title on the reconcile page, reconcile transactions. I can maybe show you one right here

Unknown Speaker  1:16:27
quickly. Yeah,

Speaker 4  1:16:36
so can you add the as of date into this title? Is what I'm hoping for. What's

Unknown Speaker  1:16:42
it's just an ass prompt.

Speaker 4  1:16:45
Yeah, so like right here statement, end up, end date would be what it would be, because Sure, I have no way of knowing which one this is, unless I open that back up.

Speaker 3  1:16:58
Would that get added to the paper cut list. Then, yeah, we'll add, no, that's another 510, minute change. Okay, great, um,

Speaker 4  1:17:09
and then another one is so if I, if I download, say, a PDF or an Excel file of a balance sheet, income statement. Any of those, is there a way to add to the name that default name that it gets, and add, like an end date or an as of date? They should all be asked phones like the balance sheet, throw the as of date in there. Income Statement. Throw an end date in there, because I've been downloading reports, downloading these Excel files and stuff, and then suddenly I just have a whole bunch of standard balance sheet, you know, downloaded, and I can't tell which, without opening them up and looking at my date and all that.

Speaker 3  1:18:00
Besides, do you remember offhand, what? Because it's just running Excel on a normal Excel export, on a normal report, I'm assuming,

Speaker 4  1:18:11
yeah, it just comes from, like the the little drop down, yeah, corner.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:21
Sorry, I spaced a minute. I

Speaker 3  1:18:23
was trying to update file names on a so just from a normal like the balance sheet, when you export to Excel, I I'm thinking that that's like a no, but missing something,

Speaker 1  1:18:44
I don't know what to tell you, besides figuring out how it's how we're determining it, I would think it's report title, but that's

Speaker 3  1:18:50
what. Well, then let me look at balance sheet. Balance Sheet is, looks like balance sheet should include as of and company and stuff also, unless it's just the like, the report name

Speaker 2  1:19:18
Josh bill, it's so excuse me, so that we can bet those around last week, which is we could pull now. So, so I think that eliminates the need for five of

Speaker 4  1:19:31
them at once. Yeah, well, that would, I mean, that would make a difference. You'd still be it'd still be nice, because anything that I say that way, or whatever, when you send, I mean, doable. Let's do it. If it's not, we'll keep dealing with it.

Speaker 3  1:19:50
I'm just, I would have thought, Do you what exactly is it pulling? Is it just saying? Saying. So my guess is it's either saying something like, probably see standard balance sheet right, exported as of, okay, yeah, and that would be that's, yeah, no, sorry, unless empathize, unless we'd be wrapping we could theoretically call it now you would have to have another report to wrap it if you wanted to export with a nice name, right? Yeah, yeah. No,

Speaker 1  1:20:36
we've got so many prompts to duplicate exactly that. So sorry, but

Speaker 4  1:20:44
that is fine. That's it for now that I've got, okay,

Speaker 2  1:20:52
we'll repriorit Or we'll, yeah, clean this up. Send you the list and like something like this. Should I start always sending it to the inside it. What is it

Unknown Speaker  1:21:05
support?

Unknown Speaker  1:21:06
Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:21:11
I don't I'm trying to think

Unknown Speaker  1:21:13
the email Josh had sent out sure support items.

Speaker 3  1:21:20
Yeah, I know. I know what you're talking about. I'm just trying to think that it actually needs is this, this list is just stuff for, basically, for me and Matthias to be working on, basically me to be coding, I think. But I don't think it needs to, okay, clutter their inboxes. But I think so, because otherwise, it's just going to a few more people that aren't actually wanting to see it, not specifically. Okay,

Speaker 4  1:21:51
that that helps clarify for me, too. So this, when we send some of that email, it goes to everybody's individual email. It's not like it's a place that if you're needing something from us, you go there and you look for it there, um,

Speaker 3  1:22:06
I mean, it will send our individual emails. It also goes to a like a shared inbox, so we can see everything that's come to that address. So I guess I should also just ask Ellis and Josh, what? What all they want going there, in general, I think they're wanting just most stuff to go through there. I would think this one, this specifically. I don't think would have to go there, but I don't know that I have it. I don't know. Matthias, do you have more of an idea on their what workflow they're wanting or not really.

Speaker 1  1:22:44
I know. What do we do this one, why don't you they're, they're the ones owning it. So I would Seth, why don't you check in with, yeah, with Yeah, with your dad on that.

Speaker 5  1:22:59
Um, good, good. That's all we had any

Speaker 1  1:23:09
nope, Seth, give me uh, five minutes to regroup and we'll tackle the duplication warning. Yep, sounds good.

Unknown Speaker  1:23:19
Okay, cool.

Unknown Speaker  1:23:20
Thank you guys. Bye.
