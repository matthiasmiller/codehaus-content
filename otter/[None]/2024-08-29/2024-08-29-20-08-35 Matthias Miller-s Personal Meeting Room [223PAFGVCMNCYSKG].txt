Unknown Speaker  00:39
Hey, yes,

Speaker 1  00:42
good luck. Little rain. Nice evening. Yeah, in Colorado, you celebrate that. Not everywhere in the US do you do that, but at least where I'm at,

Unknown Speaker  00:53
here's something so calming about you said you were in the rain. Good for you, like, just t shirt, jacket,

Unknown Speaker  01:02
t shirt.

Speaker 2  01:06
I always could go out as a kid just a t shirt, until my mom told me to put a jacket on, and then I started getting sick. I think there's something to, yeah, to that being rugged, you know, not, not necessarily a David Goggins thing, but Right? But

Speaker 1  01:35
when I first moved here, I would jog in single digits in a short sleeve shirt. So

Unknown Speaker  01:44
I was thinking about how this guy named Graham Cooke, yeah, he he's a, he's a pastor out in Santa, Barbara, okay, well, he talks about, he doesn't pray when he has anxiety.

Speaker 2  02:15
He's like, That's not he said, you stop having and then it's like, in the wrong spirit, yeah, and I thought that was kind of fascinating. I was like, he basically, he's like, he doesn't, because God doesn't operate through anxiety. Now I don't think he's saying, never pray if you have anxiety, is that, like the Psalms, is kind of clearly you see the arc of prayer. But I thought that was the right thing is, is that's not the main channel

Unknown Speaker  02:57
for communication

Speaker 2  02:59
and inner doubt, is fear, anxiety. It's, it's,

Speaker 2  03:10
it's not like a listening, posh posture. It's, maybe it's like a, it's a, it's an obsessed posture around, you know around yourself,

Unknown Speaker  03:21
it's a forced outcome.

Speaker 2  03:27
Instead of opening your hands right, you're grasping It's like opening your hands.

Unknown Speaker  03:38
Anyways. Not sure if that ties in, but

Speaker 1  03:41
I took a spin on this. It's a little might be over the top, but

Speaker 2  03:52
I think, I think you could say, I, I, I I trusted, I trusted these experts. And that's a good like, that's a good thing, but you became Reliant and dependent on them, and now that's not good because then they're taking, they're taking a different position in your life, right? Right? Like, what's, what's the proper role of you're not, these aren't bad words, no, it's just they don't, they're not primary, or they don't take press, right? I

Speaker 1  04:47
mean, it's kind of like the idea that during the formative time you need experts. It's kind of what Peter talks about, to break the rules. You need to know how to abide by the rules. Yeah. I mean, you don't get permission to. Of the rules until you've done that. So I think there's a sense in which

Speaker 2  05:08
you were already apprenticed. Now it's now it's go after your own craft,

Speaker 1  05:13
right? Yes, yes, yes.

Speaker 3  05:21
I had spent I been,

Unknown Speaker  05:37
yeah, I like, I like Tom Francis treat the master,

Speaker 2  05:56
and He gave me a good language for Messiah making. Well. Well, you Messiah make, oh,

Unknown Speaker  06:05
Messiah make,

Unknown Speaker  06:05
right, right.

Speaker 2  06:17
Oh, there you go. That's good. I spend so much time, right, right? It's like now you're supposed to join, you're supposed to become a peer to the Masters,

Unknown Speaker  06:30
right? Right?

Speaker 3  06:39
I um,

Speaker 2  06:48
and I mean, what Perry said about Megan is like he how special it is that when a student of yours teaches you, right? So maybe you, maybe there's room to say, like you, you didn't see the thing, hey, part of, part of moving beyond apprenticeship is you have a voice and can even instruct the people that you hold as mentors, right? It's like a two way road to right. Move from I maybe a good word is over reliance. I

Speaker 1  07:44
um, I had unconsciously become over reliant on these voices in the moment that I heard my own voice. Okay,

Speaker 2  07:57
maybe, maybe we need to distinguish between there's only voices, maybe say experts or Expert voices, or

Unknown Speaker  08:16
on these experts? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  08:21
um, and, and it's almost you. You outsourced. You outsource the most important work to them, which is like holding space for who you are.

Unknown Speaker  08:41
Okay?

Unknown Speaker  08:45
Not sure if that's a line, but I

Speaker 2  09:05
Oh, you know what, maybe on this to the point, to the point that i be i i mistrusted, I miss I mistrusted my own,

Unknown Speaker  09:28
my expertise and experience

Unknown Speaker  09:31
expertise. Yeah, I you. Downplayed my I

Unknown Speaker  09:48
diminished. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  09:49
there you go. It's like you subordinated. It's you. You made a second. Dairy,

Unknown Speaker  10:02
finished,

Unknown Speaker  10:04
my own expertise and experience great,

Speaker 2  10:12
my own, My own, with uh. Being A student, a student of

Unknown Speaker  11:00
uh, not sure If I like

Speaker 2  11:18
following the voice of experts. I I didn't recognize my own, my own growth, my growth and transferring. It

Speaker 2  11:40
was time, it was time, time to move.

Speaker 2  11:57
Maybe it's like become, becoming A leader, not Just a follower,

Unknown Speaker  12:47
there you go.

Speaker 2  12:59
Yeah, this is, actually, this is, you know, the Dunning Kruger thing, like, at the beginning, you're confident, but you have, you know nothing, right? And then as you go down, you actually know things. You know a lot more things, but you're you you

Unknown Speaker  13:23
you're just aware of so much so you doubt yourself.

Unknown Speaker  13:32
Um,

Unknown Speaker  13:36
so

Speaker 1  13:40
I began to rationalize my decisions, to rationalize and I began to rationalize my own choices,

Unknown Speaker  13:54
to defend

Speaker 1  13:55
against my own doubt. However even reason,

Unknown Speaker  14:02
can you say I rationalized my doubts,

Unknown Speaker  14:12
my doubts,

Unknown Speaker  14:13
I justified my doubts

Speaker 1  14:16
with I guess what I'm trying to say is, okay, I have a friend of mine. There's a train that goes through town in the middle of the night. It's honking the horn inordinately long when there's nobody around. And my friend jokes that it's the short man syndrome. The guy who blows the horn the longest is the shortest man. It's akin to that. It's, well, not quite tall poppy, but it's, it's overcompensating for your perceived weakness. Not even a weakness, perceived weakness. So

Speaker 2  14:53
that's Megan's storyline. It's overcompensating. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  15:01
I've never done that. Ever in my life.

Unknown Speaker  15:08
I overcompensated eating pasta is like way too much I was trying to eat fast.

Unknown Speaker  15:22
Got it? Sorry,

Speaker 2  15:23
I have no that was good. Yeah, sometimes it's nice to have a reason to exit. So you did me a favor. Good.

Speaker 1  15:38
I'm glad, because this is what worked best for

Speaker 2  15:44
me. Oh, here's, here's the thought you there's still pieces to the like pieces you don't understand. And it's easy to look at only look at the things you don't know, the unknown and forget that you have actually mapped out. That's the you've actually mapped it out like quite a bit, and maybe celebrated, celebrated what you've what you've achieved and accomplished, and I know

Unknown Speaker  16:28
I'm

Speaker 2  16:35
not giving you anything. I'm just just throwing things. That's what I do. I throw spaghetti on the wall.

Unknown Speaker  16:44
See what sticks. It's good dinner meal

Unknown Speaker  16:47
that has chili, chili.

Unknown Speaker  16:51
Okay, so Chris, I didn't

Speaker 4  16:55
I, I

Speaker 1  17:06
I understand the I rationalize my doubts. That's too simplistic for me, but maybe there's

Speaker 2  17:17
I didn't I didn't have okay. So this is me, being my background in philosophy as a major in college. We, we had this kind of running joke when we because of we live in an age of skepticism, and it's fashionable, and it's, it's harder to say the true thing than to, you know, shoot shoot people down, shoot ideas down, right? And so we as students, we, we, I don't know who did it, but we came up with this. When you raise your hand to object or comment with the teacher. You don't raise it. You don't go, like this. You kind of like, it's like a backhanded like, like this is, I don't know the it was pretty funny, but we, I don't know if it was this faculty of everybody. He says,

Unknown Speaker  18:24
basically, you have to, if you're going to doubt, like you have to apply doubt also to the same measure, to your own doubts,

Speaker 2  18:41
like you doubted everything. You doubted everything, but your doubts, right? I think, I think that's what, that's what a world without truth does is you fly upside down and you're you rash, right? Like, what's up is down, what's down is up, and you've lost your your your, your instruments, right? You're in the file if

Unknown Speaker  19:16
you're going to doubt,

Unknown Speaker  19:19
doubt, your doubts.

Speaker 1  19:23
There's my random late night Facebook post that people will eat up. Is it worth inner doubts? I guess my thought is what I'm wanting to do is express how it played out.

Unknown Speaker  19:42
Okay to

Unknown Speaker  19:57
to.

Unknown Speaker  20:03
Competition again

Unknown Speaker  20:08
to justify

Unknown Speaker  20:13
path

Unknown Speaker  20:13
I wanted to go,

Unknown Speaker  20:20
use an argument. I don't know that's Um,

Unknown Speaker  20:28
okay, here's a thought.

Speaker 2  20:36
Okay, taking a shortcut is maybe, maybe cutting the meat off of what could be said. But if you skip down to the true weapon, union with the truth, it's this. This past took me outside the bounds of business as usual into a very personal and spiritual journey, which is maybe you just connect it to you. This is your journey to mastery. Now you're needing to master something spiritual.

Unknown Speaker  21:08
Um,

Unknown Speaker  21:25
oh, also,

Speaker 2  21:29
this is where you could say. You could say the one, the one voice, or the one expert

Unknown Speaker  21:38
that did help

Speaker 2  21:40
was the one who told me to not niche and to break rules, which is basically your category of one, like, don't, don't. Yeah,

Speaker 2  22:18
drawing your own maybe it's drawing your own boundaries,

Speaker 2  22:27
settling into your own mind, to

Speaker 1  22:31
chart my own course, even if it meant breaking the rules of business. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  22:43
yeah, exactly, even if it meant breaking all the, the best practices, Advice,

Speaker 4  22:48
the rules from the experts, right?

Unknown Speaker  23:01
I'm gonna Oh.

Speaker 1  23:20
I don't know this is too much, but there is this thing where I was the one expert. I listened to everybody, to the all the experts except one

Unknown Speaker  23:51
myself, right?

Speaker 2  23:55
That's that. I mean one, one way of looking at it is the round table. Okay, that you were looking at all these experts, not realizing. Look, you're looking out and seeing experts, right? You're not the way they look out. They also see experts, right? But from where you're sitting, you don't, you don't see yourself.

Speaker 1  24:31
Okay? So this, this is for you to I need your editing. This is super crisp, and I mean, super short. I

Unknown Speaker  24:37
hope it's Chris. What Yes,

Unknown Speaker  24:46
I came so engrossed in the journey that I

Unknown Speaker  24:57
see that I overlooked, overlooking. Overlooked, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  25:11
so, so, this is my

Unknown Speaker  25:16
transformation. Yeah, sorry I was gonna you might appreciate this as a programmer or as a person of sanctuary, I should say this is like a weird rabbit trail I got into was getting like a different keyboard.

Speaker 1  25:44
That is awesome. Okay, split mechanical.

Speaker 2  25:48
It's split mechanical, but it's got the it's got the thumb and enter right? It's great. So the backspace of my thumb anyways, so I've used the Kinesis the ergonomic keyboard for his carpal tunnel runs in my family, so but this, I changed the I started to use. I'm even forgetting the name of it. It's not your Qwerty default

Speaker 4  26:22
direct, no, no,

Unknown Speaker  26:26
it's an it's like, it's this other one.

Speaker 2  26:34
Maybe it's colmac. I forget anyways, like I researched, like a bunch of them, and I programmed the keys and and there's, there's, like, one or two letters I keep messing up. And so when you see me, when you see me, you know what's happening if I mess up. That's funny. I overlooked my transformation. I had moved from apprenticeship to mastery, by the way, that was like, that was me really going, kind of doing away with convention. And it was, it wasn't, it wasn't like an accelerant, like when you're going off the off the proven path, you're, you're, you know, you're both

Unknown Speaker  27:32
Yes,

Speaker 2  27:36
yes. And it was slow, like I I went from I was pretty fast typer, yeah, and now

Unknown Speaker  27:48
back to 30 words a bit,

Speaker 2  27:53
but all the keys are arranged close to my hands, like The most, right? So it's like there's a payoff. But you kind of have to go through the no I see walking outside of bounds of,

Speaker 1  28:13
can we just take shorten this down to I became, oh yeah, I became overly reliant on these experts I listened to. There's actually experts again, all the experts except one myself.

Unknown Speaker  28:33
Maybe, maybe this is like a nice conclusion.

Speaker 1  28:39
The one expert who did help advise me to chart my own course, even if it meant breaking the rules of business. I had listened to all the experts except myself, which is a TF for Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  28:55
So this I'm

Speaker 4  29:02
your Um, can I just cut all the just cut it all? Yeah, show it over the next,

Unknown Speaker  29:12
I Guess I can move these.

Unknown Speaker  29:21
Okay, so

Speaker 2  29:32
I'm I think maybe it's you had the capacity to. Right?

Speaker 2  30:06
Explain, no, the capacity for the truth channel, oh, like you just had to change to a different frequency.

Speaker 4  30:18
Yes, yes, yes, yes. As I move, oh,

Speaker 2  30:28
I forget what Graham Cooke says. He just changes from am to pm, but he calls it anxiety, if something and then presence something, I

Unknown Speaker  31:06
I mean it's It's

Speaker 1  31:09
modulation. So I mean anxiety modulation, presence modulation. I

Unknown Speaker  31:31
I think as the voices I

Unknown Speaker  31:45
as I tuned out,

Speaker 4  31:48
as I tune out, uh, voices,

Speaker 2  31:55
voices. The problem is, it's there is a voice of truth. So at some point I feel like you want to say just experts, or

Speaker 4  32:07
turn as a tune out the experts. It turned into something far more nuanced, even my own voice. I

Speaker 2  32:23
it's more, I think it's more that this is get that that that gave me my own voice,

Unknown Speaker  32:31
or more new ones

Unknown Speaker  32:39
here that gave me my own voice?

Unknown Speaker  32:42
Yeah,

Speaker 2  32:53
oh, I guess maybe I'm not making the point you want, which is there's something more than your voice. I

Speaker 4  33:09
and my voice alone. I hadn't only been looking for truth. I hadn't only been looking for my voice. Okay,

Speaker 2  33:25
so you're saying, you're saying myself about it. This is experts, this is yourself. You're saying it's not even the experts or myself. It's union with the truth.

Unknown Speaker  33:40
Yes. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  33:48
books, podcasts or mentors, I don't know how to

Unknown Speaker  33:59
maybe, maybe you need, maybe you need a line.

Unknown Speaker  34:10
You

Speaker 2  34:12
You might call this god. I don't know if Perry has like a line where it's like, whatever you want to call it, if you want to go there,

Unknown Speaker  34:32
all right, you Know, Like you personally call it God or you, you

Unknown Speaker  34:54
um.

Speaker 4  35:07
I have been looking for I've been looking for My voice. Me is restricted, More than just Okay, I

Unknown Speaker  38:07
thanks for tuning In. There's

Unknown Speaker  38:08
Something

Speaker 1  38:22
really okay, let's do This more than voice alone, my spiritual journey brought me to learn the sound of truth.

Speaker 4  39:14
How I been taking something up brought me to know, to know the sound of truth. You might call that Spirit, God, universe,

Unknown Speaker  39:32
love, head office

Speaker 4  39:36
or um,

Unknown Speaker  39:45
I don't know how else to or

Unknown Speaker  39:47
encounter an experience I.

Unknown Speaker  40:00
I'm gonna say Goodbye real Quick. I'm

Unknown Speaker  41:20
Okay, thanks.

Speaker 2  41:39
Well, something. Something Perry calls, like Renaissance time important for getting clarity and discernment. So I think that's and that that can be about anything right. It can be about your your strengths, your identity, your path, your projects, your but I like, I like the language of sharpening your intuition or

Unknown Speaker  42:18
your your I them,

Speaker 2  42:23
your ability to discern, and I think he calls it the gray areas, right? Like, these are the higher levels. Like the experts can tell you, how should I put it? Someone said this, like, hey, experts like doctors, are great at solving known problems, right? But if there's anything unknown, new, whatever's new on the horizon, it's like a toying costs.

Unknown Speaker  42:53
Yes, it's like coin toss, and it's like, you know, because they're not the experts there. So you need, you can't just pattern match, because it's, it's something different, right?

Speaker 2  43:18
So that's, that's why the gray area and like listening to the voice discerning through the fog or through the

Unknown Speaker  43:30
right, right, right, right, right.

Speaker 2  43:31
But it's a, it's, it's, maybe this is worth saying union with truth like that. This is a this is a person, a relationship, a conversation, and then we can get to what you like, which is a creative partner,

Unknown Speaker  43:56
right? I

Unknown Speaker  44:10
and that that presence is what I don't know, what you say soothes or calms the inner doubts, because you're not alone, right? Maybe you don't have to fight and compete, right? You're not, because you're not isolated,

Unknown Speaker  44:31
right? I like, I mean,

Speaker 1  44:39
I mean it was the it was, it is, it was the ultimate strategic

Unknown Speaker  44:46
collaboration,

Speaker 2  44:49
yeah, I'm was the ultimate, yeah, the master strategist, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  44:56
Um,

Unknown Speaker  44:58
okay, this one. I don't know. I'm just going to this is this is too much. This, this gets to go.

Unknown Speaker  45:13
That might be okay. Let's kind of becoming a little one,

Unknown Speaker  45:19
okay, well, take your ax or your

Unknown Speaker  45:23
tune into something far more. I tuned into,

Unknown Speaker  45:33
tune into other voices.

Speaker 2  45:39
Wait, maybe, maybe it's, maybe it's as you attend to your own voice, you realize there's something to that as you listen to your own voice. And so Bob HAMP said, he says,

Speaker 2  46:02
the kind of mistaken way of going about it is trying to connect with God. You first have to connect with yourself, yes, and then you can connect with God. And that's similar to the anxiety thing. Don't break out of anxiety, yes. So maybe if, as you attend to my your own voice, you find there's an inner voice. You find the voice, right? Capital,

Unknown Speaker  46:32
okay, let's, let's try this.

Speaker 2  46:39
And by the way, if the voice isn't speaking inside you, is speaking inside you, there's a union there,

Unknown Speaker  46:46
right? Yeah,

Speaker 2  46:55
I I'm not sure if you need to say buried in books and stuff, because, because you already covered that in the inner doubt and the double edged sword. I mean, you could, you could put that out there. The double edged

Unknown Speaker  47:13
wasn't out there. Um,

Unknown Speaker  47:17
the buried in books and, okay,

Unknown Speaker  47:26
I wasn't out there, but closer to home and closer to my heart out there.

Unknown Speaker  47:40
This is prime stuff to tick off a whole bunch of

Unknown Speaker  47:44
religious folks

Unknown Speaker  47:54
close to my heart, I

Speaker 1  47:56
kind of like the idea of bringing in the I I

Unknown Speaker  48:09
don't know how to do this.

Speaker 4  48:16
It's close to my heart. I realized it wasn't about seeking to wasn't about a spiritual journey to hear truth.

Speaker 4  48:41
It was about finding union with the truth,

Unknown Speaker  48:49
with an instruction right put a person.

Unknown Speaker  49:00
I Okay,

Unknown Speaker  49:14
I'm importing a lot of my philosophy so, so, right, whatever I say, Well, I

Speaker 1  49:20
mean, I don't disagree that's a person and just it's not the

Speaker 2  49:25
angle you want. Angle, um,

Speaker 2  49:45
the angle is union and creative partnership. There's an inner voice, and that's what gives you the inner knowing. So the inner voice is. There's your voice, and then there's a there's a

Unknown Speaker  50:11
I would love to

Speaker 1  50:20
you could almost up in the devil edged sword. You could even talk about the people who was whatever,

Unknown Speaker  50:32
the outside voice of memos,

Speaker 1  50:39
prophetic insight that doesn't come from place of union, which means there's distorted interpretation, or distorted understanding.

Speaker 2  50:50
I feel like, if this, if you're going to be that direct, like most of this is, is very indirect, and it's a little like

Unknown Speaker  51:03
out there, but maybe you, maybe you do want to be a little more direct.

Unknown Speaker  51:11
I don't know. I don't know.

Speaker 1  51:13
I turned into my own. The truth, I've been singing wasn't out there. I'm not quite sure if it was close to my heart. It wasn't out there.

Unknown Speaker  51:21
It was in here.

Speaker 2  51:23
It wasn't, it wasn't, it wasn't my own, but it was, it wasn't mine, but it was, it was like it wasn't mine, it's not mine, but it's for me.

Speaker 1  51:45
Well, but here's where I would probably take a little bit of a different bend, which is, I think the whole point of union is that it's not just, there's

Speaker 2  51:57
a belonging. When I say it's not mine, it's it's not your voice, like it's not,

Speaker 1  52:04
well, I would actually, you know, I don't know if there's union. There's two voices that blend and harmonize. Sure, that's what I'm trying to get after.

Speaker 2  52:17
But you, you're, the way you're setting this up is you're separating. There's the world's voice experts, there's my voice, and then there's the voice of truth, and union with the truth,

Unknown Speaker  52:35
correct?

Speaker 2  52:36
So before you blend them, you're setting them up right

Speaker 1  52:42
tune into my point. Okay, so help me out. Well,

Speaker 2  52:57
I think you're drawing. I think it's helpful to delineate, to draw a distinction, and maybe you say there's three there's three voices, there's external Voices,

Unknown Speaker  53:20
there's your voice, and then there's the voice, the voice, the voice of the world, or the voice of

Speaker 1  53:40
Well, okay, so, but then I had listened to all the experts except one. Sounds like a great line, except it's not true. I listened to all the ex, all the experts, except two, myself in truth,

Speaker 2  53:58
except my own and and accept my own and my Well,

Speaker 2  54:11
it's almost like you're introducing two voices all at once, which is a little hard. The

Speaker 1  54:20
only way to do it with with double edged sword is to introduce the voice of truth as an outside advice.

Speaker 2  54:29
But I think this is where it's not an outside it's an inner, yes, inner, inner voice, and that's the inner knowing, right?

Speaker 2  54:53
And when, maybe when you have an inner knowing, you're hearing the voice of truth, your union. In with the truth. It sounds in your own voice, right? Like it's blinded.

Speaker 1  55:08
I tuned into my own Okay, as I tuned out. Then I tuned into my own voice. I discovered the truth was truth I did seeking wasn't out there.

Unknown Speaker  55:19
In fact, you

Speaker 2  55:44
maybe, is it worth drawing a like a this is probably too complicated for people, but like a material versus a spiritual, I

Speaker 2  56:06
What Dallas. Dallas calls it the still small voice. So I think when I when I attended to my soul and found found my own voice, I

Speaker 2  56:26
uh, you encountered a you encountered maybe this is how you describe the you just describe what it's like to hear the voice of truth, which is, it comes with peace, it comes with power. It comes with right

Unknown Speaker  56:47
is it to know? And

Speaker 2  56:49
so it's like, well, these are different voices. One causes anxiety. One doesn't. Maybe that's maybe that's something. One causes inner doubt, and one gives, one gives peace into the voices and assurance. How about that peace and assurance

Speaker 4  57:12
discovered one voice that brought me inner doubt. Other voice brought me inner knowing.

Unknown Speaker  57:23
Well, that was your own voice of inner doubt.

Unknown Speaker  57:29
So I have two voices.

Unknown Speaker  57:34
That's where I'm that's where I feel like you're not. This is like bad, bad thinking. This is like, this is, this is like, distinctions matter.

Unknown Speaker  57:51
Yeah,

Speaker 2  57:55
there's, there's, I think philosophically, there's distinction by Essence, okay,

Unknown Speaker  58:04
the

Speaker 2  58:09
quality of being okay, there's a distinction that's mental, which is it's not actually real. It's just an abstract. So I think the sky is blue, right? And the sky isn't, it's it has its own identities. Then there's a distinction. It's called modal, but it basically means,

Unknown Speaker  58:41
uh, is it

Speaker 2  58:44
a property of the thing, right? Uh, it could be a union of two things, but, but if one is taken away, it, it's, it's a property or quality, or in if, if the main thing doesn't die, right? So my arm isn't me, but it's like property of Marcos, right? So this is where, this is where I want. I think, I think the voice isn't just a mental distinction,

Unknown Speaker  59:34
right? No, it's not,

Unknown Speaker  59:35
and it's not, it's,

Unknown Speaker  59:39
it's not modal either,

Speaker 2  59:42
right? It's, it's, it's, uh, it's like an essence. It's okay. I

Unknown Speaker  59:47
have a proposal.

Speaker 1  59:50
Strike this sentence into a very personal and spiritual journey. It sounds so good, but it's, it's, it's screwing up the T up. Except.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:01
Yes, except, except one dealing with the truth, yep,

Speaker 2  1:00:19
except for the voice, what if you say the voice of truth? Or just except, except the one, okay, and maybe you skip over yourself. What's What's tricky about this is you've already talked about real connection, or your real self, right connection with your real self. So that's kind of, to me, that's kind of the your voice part, right. Okay,

Speaker 1  1:00:58
right, right, right. Okay. So as a two note, the experts,

Speaker 2  1:01:08
I was just thinking I was slowed down and lean into and leaned into my real self, and I

Speaker 2  1:01:23
I found I found I found a a still small voice,

Speaker 3  1:01:35
voice that

Speaker 2  1:01:46
and that came from my soul. It's like a deep part of you, just from deep within, from deep within.

Unknown Speaker  1:02:02
I discovered wasn't out there. It

Unknown Speaker  1:02:15
this, this voice had been with me. I

Unknown Speaker  1:02:23
and guiding me all along,

Unknown Speaker  1:02:28
when guiding me, remember

Speaker 2  1:02:36
offering offering guidance, offering guidance from the beginning, sure the beginning, if It didn't, it didn't produce and adapt.

Unknown Speaker  1:02:52
Well, this,

Unknown Speaker  1:03:02
yeah,

Speaker 2  1:03:07
my my inner doubts. The might be inner doubt. Can be inner doubt, or do you just want inner doubts? My

Speaker 1  1:03:16
inner doubt is an i, because it's a it's tribal language. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:03:22
look at you. Look at you. Talk. There you go. Yeah, see,

Speaker 1  1:03:26
I'm getting indoctrinated. I slowed down and leaned into my real self. I found a still small I'm not completely sure about the still small

Speaker 2  1:03:37
voice, yeah, that's okay, a voice spoke to me from within. Well, okay, what if? What if it, what if it's just, I just that wasn't out there

Unknown Speaker  1:03:57
to I.

Speaker 2  1:03:58
A voice had been with me, offering

Unknown Speaker  1:04:04
from deep within it had the voice the truth.

Speaker 2  1:04:16
This is amazing when I edit and when you edit, and when I command Z, it doesn't undo your edit, it undoes mine.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:29
It's nuts. That is, you know, crazy. Do you

Speaker 1  1:04:33
Do you know how complex multi user editing is? I mean, it's especially when it's asynchronous, like this, like you have connection blips and like, It's insanity and it's it's free. Oh, and by the way, this text editor, everything is custom built from ground up, like it's. A custom built web page for editing text. It's the only way they could get high fidelity text editing. All the browser tools are horribly non compliant with each other for editing these types of things. It's the only way to do it. So

Speaker 2  1:05:18
sounds like there's a asynchronous voices.

Speaker 1  1:05:23
So okay, I'm not quite sure where you're going with this. I lead, that's okay. I discovered the truth. I've been seeing him wasn't out there.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:38
Instead,

Speaker 1  1:05:40
I heard its voice from deep that what if you say, yeah, the truth, yeah. Have been with me, offering guidance from the beginning. Its voice quieted the inner doubt and gave me peace, groundedness and courage.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:11
I think that's two separate sentences. Okay, I received

Speaker 3  1:06:18
peace. I peace. I

Speaker 2  1:06:43
Yes, you actually had some good lines down there. Forgot about this.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:53
It's presence,

Unknown Speaker  1:06:56
no Susie ended out. Presence, beat

Unknown Speaker  1:07:09
I don't know. I don't know what down here. Do you want to

Unknown Speaker  1:07:15
grab? What's that? Yep, I

Unknown Speaker  1:07:23
I'm not sure if it's here,

Unknown Speaker  1:07:32
maybe,

Speaker 1  1:07:40
as I invited me into a dynamic conversation, relationship, in creative partnership. As I stepped into, stepped into the end it's voice quieted the my, my inner doubt.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:59
I discovered. Found, received

Speaker 2  1:08:09
its voice, its presence gave me peace, groundedness and courage.

Speaker 2  1:08:29
Uh, imparted peace, gave me peace. I don't know if groundedness is you could just say it's gave me peace.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:47
Isn't that quieting in or doubt?

Speaker 2  1:08:53
Well, yeah, that's just like the poetic wave of this day I marry. You know that, man and woman, it's like it's just the poetic wave, repeat, repetition, redundancy.

Speaker 1  1:09:11
There's only two. Um, my it's voice quieted my inner doubt. It gave me presence. Gave me peace. I found belonging in its presence.

Speaker 2  1:09:23
Look at that. Now you took you took the poetry to another level.

Speaker 1  1:09:31
All right. I found belonging in its

Unknown Speaker  1:09:34
presence.

Speaker 2  1:09:36
We're doing philosophy and poetry all at once. Look

Speaker 1  1:09:39
at the poetry and sales and marketing and consulting. This has got

Unknown Speaker  1:09:46
nothing on me. Yeah,

Speaker 1  1:09:50
you've been trained well. It wasn't about getting flashes of insight, although it happened with increasing frequency. It wasn't about learning what to do, although that happened. This. Well,

Unknown Speaker  1:10:02
it was about

Unknown Speaker  1:10:10
the transformation. I was

Unknown Speaker  1:10:12
about union with the truth. Yeah, truth

Speaker 1  1:10:20
had been with me. From beginning, offering guidance. Have been with me. It's voiced quite a minor doubt I found belonging in His presence. It wasn't about getting clash. It's about union. Is the truth. It was

Speaker 2  1:10:32
we say instead of, it's what if we say the voice, the voice in the presence, and

Speaker 1  1:10:40
it's yeah, in you could even say in present, there we

Unknown Speaker  1:10:45
go. I like that. There you go.

Speaker 1  1:10:51
This is just borderline, like, sorry, this is, I'm thinking of my most fundamentalist friends. This is like, borderline slipping by them and making them happy. I'm not optimizing for that, but

Unknown Speaker  1:11:06
Oh, you're saying making them happy. They're

Unknown Speaker  1:11:09
like, then being okay. Oh, you're okay. Well, that's turning into the angry line.

Speaker 2  1:11:16
That's the thing is, you're you're stepping out enough to come back and be like, Aha, gotcha.

Speaker 2  1:11:32
I think this was great to not to separate our own voice. I like this a lot, not having to figure out all

Speaker 1  1:11:43
of anything you want to rescue yet from what's about to disappear.

Speaker 2  1:11:50
You might keep this elsewhere, I mean, like on your notes.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:56
I mean, I'll put it in my notes, but okay, no, no,

Unknown Speaker  1:12:00
okay, so

Speaker 1  1:12:01
as you step into the ignorant signature victory, there's also something. When I finally wondered outside the bounds of what I'd known, I found the very thing

Unknown Speaker  1:12:16
you know, you know what that is, is you find God in the desert.

Speaker 1  1:12:23
Uh, that's exactly it. Kevin and I have this great term, the when you go through the valley of the shadow of death, there's always people at the top of the mountain that are like, you don't want to go down there. You're going to die down there. And by the way, when you get down there, you need to do X, Y and Z. And my term for them was the armchair Sherpas. They've never been to the desert, but here's how you should manage it.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:01
Yeah, okay. Now,

Speaker 2  1:13:05
what that is just like a very departure from the flow, okay, we've rejected this so that so much that it didn't even follow, okay,

Speaker 1  1:13:17
what if we did this? This could actually be the lead in for this guy? Yeah, it's fine. When I finally wandered outside the bounds of what I'd always known, I found the very thing I hope to find in safety. Yeah,

Speaker 2  1:13:28
the unknown is there great next step, right? Because you don't, you're not given the full picture. You're just given, you're given the next step.

Speaker 1  1:13:39
And I think this is the takeaway, because truth, when you lean in, will respond back with exactly what you need, when you need. It never really, rarely early, but always on time.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:54
I said truth is always on time. I

Unknown Speaker  1:14:09
um,

Unknown Speaker  1:14:25
I didn't have to see the destination. I only needed to know that I you know,

Unknown Speaker  1:14:34
I told you, it was three pages.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:38
You lied. No,

Unknown Speaker  1:14:40
I told you. I told you, hey, just have a three page thing.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:44
Yeah, you did. I can't write three page things. This is, uh,

Unknown Speaker  1:14:50
this is a lot. This is This is

Speaker 1  1:14:53
wild. This is meaty, 10 pages. Okay, it's. Dense, 10 pages. Like you could take any one of these, like 100, the 200 word sections, and we could do a two hour podcast on it.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:16
Not today.

Speaker 1  1:15:18
No, not today. Sorry, let's, let's get this you can get to bed.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:24
You're pushing it. I'm fine. I'm okay. Oh,

Unknown Speaker  1:15:27
good, you're good, I'm good. I didn't have to see the destination.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:34
I didn't

Speaker 1  1:15:36
need to answer all the questions. I really needed to know that I had found union with the truth. Great, great. I like that. And now here's the thing I thought about on my walk. It would be great in the introduction to do a little bit of a cliffhanger about sanctuary.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:56
Well, that's what you have later invitation into

Unknown Speaker  1:15:59
this. Finally, I meant the Inter.

Speaker 1  1:16:08
Okay, so Well, let's, let's wrap this up. It'll need another is that is that it, is it,

Unknown Speaker  1:16:14
there's war below.

Unknown Speaker  1:16:17
This was the i

Speaker 2  1:16:29
Um, now, now, I think truth is found in the sanctuary, and the sanctuary is where you get the 100 proof you

Speaker 1  1:16:49
truth is independent sanctuary, which you me, You reader, you

Unknown Speaker  1:16:58
all, you all y'all,

Unknown Speaker  1:17:01
all, y'all, y'all,

Speaker 2  1:17:13
okay. Sanctuary is a place of inner knowing and union with the truth.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:22
I could say sanctuary is the place of union with the truth. This is where your inner knowing, yeah, let's see I mean,

Speaker 1  1:17:40
but it feels like sanctuary, Okay, now here's sanctuary. Just like,

Unknown Speaker  1:17:45
yeah, we I

Unknown Speaker  1:17:47
don't think you need this.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:50
Okay, let me nuke it

Unknown Speaker  1:17:54
the invitation. Because, okay, so, so you know the sanctuary sessions. The headline is, enter the sanctuary. The

Unknown Speaker  1:18:10
headline is, what? Invitations, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:18
This page,

Speaker 2  1:18:21
it's enter the sanctuary. So it's invitation to Sanctuary, and it's

Unknown Speaker  1:18:32
all right now this one is

Unknown Speaker  1:18:41
basically, it's a, okay, I've told you my journey.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:48
How about yours? And I think this whole, yeah, this is the story. This is the this is mice,

Speaker 2  1:19:06
your, your your growth story, your growth journey. No,

Unknown Speaker  1:19:25
I think you say proof version,

Speaker 2  1:19:37
and then you say the 100 proof version, the 100 proof view. And I'm here with

Unknown Speaker  1:19:50
your journey to your 100 proof.

Speaker 2  1:19:57
I honestly. I still don't think we even talked about 100 Well, no, no, the introduction, the introduction you, maybe you need to summarize the 100 proof you. Maybe, maybe this is where I bring the triangle, right? We can do that. Can totally do that to becoming

Unknown Speaker  1:20:21
the 100th version of me.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:25
This is where

Unknown Speaker  1:20:42
you know what the true weapon? Yeah. Is it inner knowing, or should your union with the truth? Because I need to change that union

Unknown Speaker  1:20:56
with the truth. Okay,

Speaker 2  1:21:02
then it's not inner doubt. Do you see

Unknown Speaker  1:21:07
union with the truth? The expected defeat is

Speaker 2  1:21:15
the inner doubt, inner knowing, false self, real self, competitive, collaborative, those are nice switches. We don't need to do that now, but

Speaker 3  1:21:41
I hundredfoot version of me,

Unknown Speaker  1:21:54
I gave up competing with others and went all in on the game of,

Unknown Speaker  1:22:08
I don't know what

Unknown Speaker  1:22:14
Broke the facade.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:19
I think this is where you.

Speaker 2  1:22:41
Yeah, yeah, that whole paragraph is good. I don't know why. Just yeah, better.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:56
Battles, victories in the path. I

Unknown Speaker  1:23:06
um, well,

Speaker 2  1:23:18
no, I think you already invited them to the sanctuary about just say the sanctuary is A dynamic experience. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:23:38
it's where you it's where you it's where you do do your deepest work, or it's where you do deep work, where you do

Speaker 2  1:24:08
here, here, maybe, maybe, instead of those three, the sanctuary gives clarity to your biggest question, gives connection, gives courage. Yeah, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:24:37
you'd like my lowercase,

Unknown Speaker  1:24:41
yeah. I mean, it's a continuation

Speaker 4  1:24:52
designed to lead you directly to your 100 proof you.

Unknown Speaker  1:24:56
It's the direct path. Yeah, it's. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:25:01
direct. I want

Unknown Speaker  1:25:03
to talk about direct path in a really indirect

Unknown Speaker  1:25:07
way. Sorry, go ahead,

Unknown Speaker  1:25:08
that's good.

Unknown Speaker  1:25:09
Let's see late next. Sorry, your

Speaker 2  1:25:11
100 proof, by the way, I at some point the quotations, I don't know. There's just too many quotations around 100 review like it should stand. It should stand on

Unknown Speaker  1:25:25
its own. I mean, do you sort of kill all

Speaker 2  1:25:27
the well, we don't need to do that now, but like, like in the in the like in the heading or the front page, right?

Speaker 2  1:25:47
Oops, we can get started. Started over here, you

Unknown Speaker  1:26:09
make it more direct

Unknown Speaker  1:26:11
start here, I

Unknown Speaker  1:26:24
anything here you want to

Speaker 4  1:26:31
rescue? No, that's 15, by the way. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:26:36
it's funny, right?

Unknown Speaker  1:26:38
Aren't you doing good? Yeah, I'm doing 20. Oh, no, there's

Speaker 2  1:26:42
sanctuary. The connection call is 20 minutes.

Speaker 1  1:26:49
Are we? Are we doing a are we doing a 20 call? A 20 minute call. I thought we said everything's 15. Everything's going through here, right?

Speaker 2  1:26:58
Well, okay, first I free. This is a discovery call, but it's and that's the question is, yes, all the manifest is go straight to consult. Consultation call, yeah,

Speaker 4  1:27:19
can I kill the stuff top. Do you need it? Kill what at the top, the very top of the

Unknown Speaker  1:27:30
step? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:27:35
yeah. I want this visible somewhere. This looks like, let's

Unknown Speaker  1:27:39
at least get rid of this. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:27:46
awesome. Okay, so a solid eight. That's a solid eight pages.

Speaker 1  1:28:01
But realistically, if you publish this in a booklet form, each one of these could be like three pages plus the intro, plus the outro invitation

Unknown Speaker  1:28:13
and visuals,

Unknown Speaker  1:28:15
actually more than that,

Unknown Speaker  1:28:17
this could be maybe 18 pages,

Unknown Speaker  1:28:26
probably, yeah, 12345,

Unknown Speaker  1:28:31
so, I mean five times, 315, 1617, was the cover.

Speaker 2  1:28:38
Yeah, testimonials, if you Oh, this is something I wanted to bring up. If you find, if you have a folder of quotes,

Unknown Speaker  1:28:48
oh, I don't, but,

Speaker 2  1:28:50
and then you tack on, like, the way you did with Sun Tzu, and then you just make it into a little box that. So it's like, it's not just you saying it, it's all the experts,

Unknown Speaker  1:29:04
same thing, yeah, all

Unknown Speaker  1:29:06
the experts that you shouldn't listen to.

Speaker 1  1:29:11
No, they've ascended to their higher self, exactly. Okay, so last, Okay, last few questions, and then let's wrap, um,

Speaker 2  1:29:22
good job. You should feel you should feel good about this, because I thought it'd take

Unknown Speaker  1:29:29
a week you consistently say this. Um,

Speaker 2  1:29:33
I mean, very few people I it'd be so painful for me to write eight pages like that, like that's, that's, I wish I had that in college.

Speaker 1  1:29:49
I hate it. I in second grade, I came home from school in tears because I had a writing assignment. It was so embarrassed because I was crying, and my mom helped me. I. And in the sixth grade, I had a teacher who we did this book contest. I had this really dumb book idea completely flopped. That kind of opened up creative writing for me in high school composition class, made me perfectionist. Me so angry. Biggest paper of the year. I got a 99% on it because I accidentally included works referenced in my works cited, and that was the only mistake that you could find in the entire thing. That's, that's ridiculous, I mean, and like, Why do I whatever? And I found out. I mean, I discovered I had to love loving away with words, and you have fantastic editorial skills. I don't know how else to say it.

Speaker 2  1:30:48
My my parents. That's my parents. Yeah, the Oh. And I've held I've held back because there's lots of there's so many passive verbs or something not even touching.

Speaker 1  1:31:07
I saw some of those. And thank you. We've done like,

Speaker 2  1:31:13
it's one voice, your story. It's not, yes, you us. It's not, it's not like, Hey, you and me are the same, like, I think it really is nicely on you self disclosure invitation. You know, what's nice about this is like you don't really have to build trust. Like, maybe you have to find out who they are, but Right? But from them to you, they've got you on paper,

Speaker 1  1:31:53
like that, in a very that's very true. Saves

Unknown Speaker  1:31:56
a lot of like, when people talk with Megan, they're not, it's not wasting time as much. Kind of like second guessing who's this person and how do I put them in a box? And there's, I think, more of a direct path. Yeah.

Speaker 1  1:32:23
I Okay, so Well, you saw how verbose and repetitive I was trying to explain myself. This is, by the way, my curse

Speaker 2  1:32:36
an eye Hoard. So that's that sounds like a

Unknown Speaker  1:32:39
good yeah, I create the excess that you stashed away. It's a good thing neither of us are dieticians the or cooks or chefs the the by the way, my my sense of humor gets quirky for the tired.

Unknown Speaker  1:32:59
My colleagues told me that

Speaker 2  1:33:03
I just opened a wedding invitation, and I remember talking to my friend Jack, and I think you just need a wife who can be silly with you. So I think, I think it came through. It came through that's awesome. I'm all I'm all for the late night. Yeah, late night.

Speaker 1  1:33:26
Goofy, Goofy humor. Um, all right, so what has to happen for me to send out an email tomorrow morning to the list, saying, Hey guys, I thanks to all of you guys who helped. I'm still working on gathering the testimonials from that, but, you know, I got good feedback. I've been working on a manifesto. I would love to have your input on it and link to a Google Doc with comments turned on, leave your feel free to leave your comments in the doc.

Speaker 2  1:34:15
Okay, before we say that, do? Does this manifesto? I yeah, I guess if you're sharing the manifesto, you don't need, I don't need the link on the website right now.

Speaker 1  1:34:31
No, I would do. I can kill that. You can kill that. The other thing is, I have some people on Facebook who who asked for this article about the two missing pillars in business? Oh, there you go. And so this is a natural one. Here's

Speaker 2  1:34:46
what's interesting. You're not explicit about the three pillars, so maybe something that could be added is these are the three pillars you. I mean, I guess the triangles there, it's,

Unknown Speaker  1:35:03
I

Speaker 1  1:35:04
might just have to shoot him a message saying, Hey. I reframed it like, Look at the look at the true I called these the true weapons. Instead of pillars.

Speaker 2  1:35:16
I like True, true weapons. I It's a little. It's a little. The issue is the union with the trees and then true weapons,

Unknown Speaker  1:35:30
but that's okay, all right, I will, you know what? We didn't even, we didn't even show the cocktail of the 100 per view.

Speaker 1  1:35:45
We didn't know that it's necessary one thing that could be really useful.

Unknown Speaker  1:35:50
Yeah, yep.

Unknown Speaker  1:35:55
Well, I don't know.

Speaker 1  1:35:58
I wish there could be. It's just a boatload of text.

Unknown Speaker  1:36:04
What if it's okay? Help me out, truth, union, union

Unknown Speaker  1:36:15
with no just with,

Speaker 2  1:36:17
it's truth and with truth is is this lower?

Speaker 1  1:36:21
I think it's, wouldn't that be lowercase? Or

Unknown Speaker  1:36:25
do you want all of these cap?

Unknown Speaker  1:36:29
I don't care. It's your call.

Unknown Speaker  1:36:31
I am so indifferent to it. I think that probably looks better visually

Unknown Speaker  1:36:37
with the W, capital, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:36:39
capital, W,

Speaker 2  1:36:40
okay, all right, then I'll throw this in. I, I'm, I'm not sure if there's

Unknown Speaker  1:36:52
export. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:36:59
dropping this in Oh,

Speaker 1  1:37:02
what about the what is the unexpected defeat is knowledge without knowing?

Unknown Speaker  1:37:10
Inner doubt would be knowledge without knowing.

Speaker 2  1:37:13
I think inner doubt is just very clear, okay, and fair enough. Okay?

Unknown Speaker  1:37:23
So

Unknown Speaker  1:37:27
on to

Unknown Speaker  1:37:30
I don't have, I don't have a,

Unknown Speaker  1:37:40
you know you could do, you could something like

Unknown Speaker  1:37:42
this. It's taking you through,

Speaker 2  1:37:46
I need, I need a background image. Where is this? You know, the sword you sent me? Yeah, I need it. I need the background removed. You can go to the shared drive. Let

Speaker 4  1:38:04
me just have to buy more credits. Oh, I can't just, oh, I can buy, yeah, 10 credits for it's a little pricey, but hey,

Unknown Speaker  1:38:22
how much is it?

Unknown Speaker  1:38:24
90 cents a

Unknown Speaker  1:38:25
credit. Terrible.

Unknown Speaker  1:38:28
It's like $1 an image. It is

Unknown Speaker  1:38:35
versus, okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:38:39
if you really like that sword, then, sure. Well,

Speaker 1  1:38:45
I paid $1 for the stock photo anyway, after deposit photos. So it's the black one. Oh,

Unknown Speaker  1:38:53
is there no way of doing a piece in

Unknown Speaker  1:38:57
inverted? No, I

Speaker 2  1:38:59
the issue is it's, it's not, it's not even, it's

Unknown Speaker  1:39:03
not pure, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:39:06
it's, it's like,

Unknown Speaker  1:39:09
oh yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:39:18
I mean, let's do this.

Speaker 1  1:39:21
Last time I worked this late, I was free image background remover from Adobe.

Speaker 4  1:39:27
It's hard to compete with. Why didn't I think that saved me nine bucks or a buck moving the background. Um, you, but didn't remove all of it.

Speaker 2  1:39:53
I think there's a way where you can do png from deposit fires. Maybe there's a. Oh, like a vector. Yes, you can. That's maybe the way to do it. They give you,

Unknown Speaker  1:40:10
I can do EPS or a I can do DPS, and then maybe an EPS to PNG.

Unknown Speaker  1:40:19
Sure, I'm not even sure what that is.

Unknown Speaker  1:40:22
EPS is a vector. Do you know what a vector is? I do you can

Unknown Speaker  1:40:27
give me a vector. It doesn't matter.

Unknown Speaker  1:40:30
I mean, if you

Unknown Speaker  1:40:38
put it in the design folder and

Speaker 3  1:40:41
design work, I there's EPS.

Unknown Speaker  1:40:50
It's in the design folder

Unknown Speaker  1:40:54
now. Oh no, it looks like black too, still.

Speaker 4  1:41:01
So let me try this. These people pixel get that. AI, everybody's so eager to impress everybody with their background removal that

Speaker 2  1:41:14
well, figma, I don't understand like, I think, I think there's some integration. I've tried several and they don't really do the job. It feels like such a basic thing.

Unknown Speaker  1:41:30
I think I have it now,

Unknown Speaker  1:41:34
if I can work.

Speaker 2  1:41:39
Okay, so while you're doing that, do you want to say, welcome to the truth? Is there anything that belongs here?

Speaker 1  1:41:49
Oh, I would just take it out. Yeah, I just think straight up the 100 proof view manifesto, undiluted everything on I mean, personally, I would probably make this bigger, move it up a little bit, maybe, or I don't know, yeah, something more like that.

Speaker 1  1:42:19
And I think the undiluted clarity connection courage wouldn't have to be that.

Unknown Speaker  1:42:34
And then I have your sword in there now. PNG, I

Unknown Speaker  1:42:47
oh dear.

Speaker 2  1:42:55
Yeah, look at the look at that power. I like that it's bigger than it's bigger than everything,

Speaker 1  1:43:08
and somehow the undiluted clarity can actually encourage looks disproportionately big. Is that just me?

Unknown Speaker  1:43:17
I clearly I don't have, don't have a tiny script.

Unknown Speaker  1:43:31
I mean, you can't

Unknown Speaker  1:43:34
just drive

Unknown Speaker  1:43:36
the weight of it.

Unknown Speaker  1:43:50
I There you go.

Unknown Speaker  1:43:54
Want it thinner? Shoot wise, these guys don't give me. I

Speaker 1  1:44:07
mean, I think, I think the what do you think? What color red is that I I don't know

Speaker 1  1:44:30
I could. I could get FF. Wait, was it? It's

Unknown Speaker  1:44:34
just FF zeros.

Unknown Speaker  1:44:38
So what if we did? I

Speaker 1  1:44:46
What if we did those headings in red in the

Unknown Speaker  1:44:55
document as well? Well, the way you can do that, I.

Unknown Speaker  1:45:00
Did you update the heading? Oops, oops. Yeah, the wrong way,

Speaker 1  1:45:07
but I'm not sure. Did I actually get the right color? I might have gotten the wrong color. Let's

Unknown Speaker  1:45:10
custom. Let's FF. You can do

Unknown Speaker  1:45:20
update hitting the match, yeah,

Speaker 2  1:45:31
and then you want these in blue, true weapons in blue, like reds, we could,

Speaker 2  1:45:52
okay, let me. Let me figure this out. 14,

Unknown Speaker  1:45:57
okay, let me do and

Unknown Speaker  1:46:03
then there's the DMC and font too.

Unknown Speaker  1:46:06
And this is going to make this blue.

Unknown Speaker  1:46:18
Oh, that's 16. Should I make this 16? 1616, there and

Unknown Speaker  1:46:28
then this should be

Unknown Speaker  1:46:35
16. Let

Unknown Speaker  1:46:38
me do I I

Unknown Speaker  1:46:42
just need to correct these.

Unknown Speaker  1:46:52
Wait, you're making them.

Unknown Speaker  1:46:53
I'm making the red, the bad ones red and the true weapon and signature victory. Yeah, or No,

Unknown Speaker  1:47:05
sure you could

Unknown Speaker  1:47:09
even, over the top, I can see the way you could even make signature victory green, no, just don't

Speaker 1  1:47:23
you miss the enemy line or it's not updating for Me. And

Unknown Speaker  1:47:34
then the introduction should be blue.

Unknown Speaker  1:47:42
You do control three, if you want to recommend option three. And then,

Speaker 2  1:47:52
oh, now, does this should be? This be read.

Unknown Speaker  1:48:00
You can just make it black, okay.

Unknown Speaker  1:48:15
Oh, well, this is I can throw the cover on the front,

Unknown Speaker  1:48:19
right. Okay, which case

Unknown Speaker  1:48:24
I would copy the image, paste it right?

Unknown Speaker  1:48:27
I would, yeah, it's okay.

Unknown Speaker  1:48:36
One second I

Unknown Speaker  1:48:43
okay.

Speaker 2  1:48:46
Now I go to, oh, this color is in red. Red is nice against black, but if we have the bad things in red.

Unknown Speaker  1:49:02
It's fine, don't

Unknown Speaker  1:49:08
let's see if it's all together. Looks all together.

Unknown Speaker  1:49:22
On want this to

Speaker 2  1:49:29
Okay. Now this is sorry. Do you want lower? Higher? I um, it's centered between them, but

Speaker 1  1:49:51
you can also try it in the corner, like to the right of right or left of manifesto. And second look, right is it?

Speaker 2  1:50:07
Let's just export. Oh, you know what? This is probably way too big.

Unknown Speaker  1:50:17
I mean, it's fine. You can always size it down. I

Unknown Speaker  1:50:29
know which is unvalid. PDF, I need to do

Unknown Speaker  1:50:34
JPEG, ping, ping would be best. I

Unknown Speaker  1:50:50
I guess. How do I how do I just like that? Do I make it in front of text and make it bigger.

Unknown Speaker  1:51:02
No, just, I don't know,

Speaker 1  1:51:07
just leave it. There we go. And let's, let's go to title.

Unknown Speaker  1:51:11
It's not necessary, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:51:17
yeah, it's not perfect.

Unknown Speaker  1:51:18
I'm not aiming for perfect,

Speaker 2  1:51:19
yeah, but this is, this is a legit draft like this is so this is ready for review.

Unknown Speaker  1:51:28
I would say, Can I kill this? Kill what the very bottom? Oh yeah, yeah. All right, 11 pages,

Unknown Speaker  1:51:42
awesome. This be Saturday.

Speaker 1  1:51:49
Are you sure that that like that? Are you sure this shouldn't the this one more story matter shouldn't go underneath this, because this is a summary of everything that you that I've,

Unknown Speaker  1:52:02
yeah, yeah, well,

Unknown Speaker  1:52:13
no, what happened? I could kill this gap.

Speaker 1  1:52:19
Well, it's very that's very easy tools.

Unknown Speaker  1:52:24
Who uses it here? I'll do it a crop. Here we go.

Speaker 2  1:52:55
I could say thank you for reading to the end, I don't know if you want your feedback, welcome at this email.

Unknown Speaker  1:53:15
I don't know. I think it's fine

Unknown Speaker  1:53:21
not to centered.

Unknown Speaker  1:53:24
Yeah, not the text, but maybe sorry you did,

Unknown Speaker  1:53:30
maybe, oh, you didn't want the text center. Just

Speaker 1  1:53:35
sorry. Was it me? You just the picture?

Unknown Speaker  1:53:38
I think so. I it,

Unknown Speaker  1:53:43
oh, let's

Unknown Speaker  1:53:46
figure out why. Let's

Unknown Speaker  1:53:47
do the got it like that, so maybe

Unknown Speaker  1:53:54
in line, oh, my gosh. Oh, you know what? There we go.

Unknown Speaker  1:54:19
Pretty good your journey to the to your 100 group here.

Speaker 2  1:54:35
Okay, now I guess, I guess I don't, not clear if there's Okay. I'll kill, kill the manifesto page. Manifesto, oops, look at it. I'll just, I.

Unknown Speaker  1:55:00
Draft.

Speaker 2  1:55:04
Okay, since it's drafted, it, well, I might as well kill it from the menu. Menu, I okay all the coaching links go to inquire, and

Speaker 2  1:55:41
I like that. There's a coaching page. This is a little and I've I just can't figure out why, when I switch between the coaching page, is there's something that makes it a little bit

Speaker 4  1:55:59
bigger, but trying to be different. Okay, let's see

Speaker 2  1:56:05
enter the sanctuary. What does this go to? This goes to the coaching. All right, all roads lead to inquiry, the 2020, minute consultation. I

Unknown Speaker  1:56:30
All right, So

Unknown Speaker  1:56:37
I Think it's uh

Speaker 2  1:57:34
Okay, so I'm Assuming, do you want to reach back to Kevin Thompson and say, share the manifesto? Say, hey, thanks. Thanks you guys so much for this. I'm not sure what you talk said before, but

Unknown Speaker  1:57:58
wait, thanks so much

Speaker 2  1:57:59
for this, I'm you reached out to them for over something, right? Did you do like a renaissance Perry post?

Unknown Speaker  1:58:11
Oh, wait, reaching out to Kevin about this.

Speaker 2  1:58:17
I thought I thought something with Kevin's group.

Speaker 1  1:58:21
I had not done anything with Kevin's group. Okay, so this is more be more like, Hey Kevin. I love to hear what's up. Wanted to share what's been developing for me.

Unknown Speaker  1:58:39
Okay, well,

Speaker 2  1:58:44
is it worth? Is it worth, if you're going to go to Perry's group first, is it worth listing the prices instead of having inquire on all the offers,

Unknown Speaker  1:59:00
well or

Speaker 2  1:59:01
I'm curious, why don't we just list it?

Unknown Speaker  1:59:13
And if I'm not directing anybody else to the website anyway,

Speaker 2  1:59:16
yeah, and who cares? They don't have the coupon. I

Speaker 3  1:59:20
The

Speaker 1  1:59:24
only theoretical issue is, if I've got some corporate person reaching out in which I just tell them, sorry, this is individual

Unknown Speaker  1:59:32
pricing. Oh, right.

Unknown Speaker  1:59:39
It's, I mean, that's a good thing. If they reach

Unknown Speaker  1:59:41
out and they do that, you

Speaker 2  1:59:45
can say, hey, like, I had a different corporate page, but you saw this page, and I'll honor this on this price, if you sign, if you sign up, right now, yeah, I.

Unknown Speaker  2:00:03
Would you do the $1,000 discount?

Unknown Speaker  2:00:08
Well, I think

Speaker 1  2:00:10
on the 1500 is very, very, very easy to swallow on a one day, VIP, good, gracious,

Unknown Speaker  2:00:19
a 1500

Unknown Speaker  2:00:20
is that the price? I

Speaker 1  2:00:22
mean, that's, it's 2500 didn't we set it at or do we set it at three? Who said it at 25 we said 1k for

Speaker 2  2:00:41
220 500 500 MSRP, Perry discount, minus 500

Speaker 1  2:00:46
Okay, but, and you were talking about taking another, another 500 off the one day

Unknown Speaker  2:00:51
for Perry.

Unknown Speaker  2:00:52
Let me, let me look at this. Okay. Oh, this is what we had. We had 3000 we had 3000

Unknown Speaker  2:01:07
down to

Unknown Speaker  2:01:10
because we had a issue.

Unknown Speaker  2:01:11
The issue is, you added this

Unknown Speaker  2:01:15
debrief call, one hour debrief call,

Speaker 2  2:01:19
yeah, so honestly, why not? Hey, just keep it 500 because it's not just 500 it's technically 1000 because you added this, right?

Speaker 1  2:01:35
The only reason for throwing another 1000 off is that for some of the folks reaching out. I mean, I've got a guy in the wings looking at that. I offered 1500

Unknown Speaker  2:01:53
for what

Unknown Speaker  2:01:54
for the one day? Just,

Speaker 2  2:01:57
yeah, great. But he doesn't get the roadmap, and he doesn't get and he doesn't get debrief, yep, he just gets this delegate, and if he wants to upgrade, he can, And you'll give him $500 off if he Yep.

Speaker 2  2:02:22
Okay, so I'll, oh, we need, we it'd be nice if we had. Are you good with these testimonials? Or,

Speaker 1  2:02:31
I think so. Okay, I don't know that they're the mode. I mean, Roberta's is pretty general, but I don't know they've got better ones.

Speaker 2  2:02:39
Well, this was, this is more of a general one,

Unknown Speaker  2:02:44
right? I mean,

Speaker 1  2:02:49
I think we've been hoping, but I guess, no, it doesn't matter. We can still come back and talk about Brian and Robert whenever they I pinged Robert again to see if he would. Brian, I have a fairly high confidence he's going to come around. But

Speaker 4  2:03:04
I guess I hope I should have just done the testimonial on the call. I don't know why I didn't, but

Speaker 2  2:03:18
Okay, so I can, I can make this page live. Sure.

Unknown Speaker  2:03:35
Okay,

Speaker 1  2:03:36
all right, so the only other thing I was thinking of, and then we wouldn't have to talk tomorrow, is friends and family.

Unknown Speaker  2:03:54
Do I lead with faith?

Unknown Speaker  2:03:59
I am i Well,

Speaker 3  2:04:00
I

Speaker 1  2:04:07
think it could be something like, I put together this cool consulting or I've been doing some

Unknown Speaker  2:04:17
fun consulting

Speaker 1  2:04:18
sessions with my clients. They've, I've been, I've been piloting some consulting sessions, some some, I guess I don't know what you call it, leadership consulting. I don't even know what it is. Some consulting sessions with my clients, and they've been loving it. I've got, I've got an article about it that I think you might enjoy reading.

Unknown Speaker  2:04:48
Let me know if you or that I don't I'm

Speaker 1  2:04:52
stumbling over myself. I'm not sure how to pitch it to them, or how to i.

Unknown Speaker  2:05:00
Well, let's not think about that now. I think you only the the main thing is pick one partner, one group that you could be a bolt on to do. Like, that's the ideal. Maybe have like, three different goals. Like, what's the

Speaker 2  2:05:40
like, Hey, this is a 90 day thing we try out, right or 60 day thing. Except Portugal is kind of a big thing right now. But, uh, maybe no, actually, this is great. This is great before round table, before all of that. Now is it? I think now is like, actually a better time. I mean,

Speaker 1  2:06:13
I don't know that they've got room in their formal promotion schedule. I'm not sure what that looks like. Okay, but what it could do is, I could call it Jeremy tomorrow. I could, I could drop it in the form talk to Jeremy. And call Jeremy tomorrow and see if he'd be free to chat or see Jeremy before you chat tomorrow.

Speaker 2  2:06:30
Or are you going to post the manifesto first? Or talk to Jeremy? You might talk to him first. I don't know. You could send him to manifesto. Yeah. Could

Speaker 1  2:06:43
send it to him and be like, Hey, Jeremy, I'd love to get your feedback on this,

Speaker 4  2:06:46
yeah, and then talk to him and also drop in the forum. Yeah,

Speaker 1  2:06:55
I would, or I plan to, hopefully doesn't create too much chaos I plan to create to clone the manifesto and create a plant Perry version with commenting enabled for anybody with a link, and then we can close down access if we ever went to

Unknown Speaker  2:07:09
Oh, of course, yeah.

Speaker 1  2:07:18
All right, so let's make sure we get this clear tomorrow. So what Perry,

Speaker 2  2:07:33
Jeremy, I don't know why. I guess Jeremy, you're floating the idea to him. You talk to him, and then,

Speaker 2  2:07:54
and then, when you're when you're actually talking to him, you you say, Hey, I and something I've noticed about memos is a lot of it's identity based, and it's great. It's good. My flavor is I

Speaker 2  2:08:23
I don't know a bit a bit more of, like a practical, yeah, whatever use spin you want to put it on. I, I don't know if, I don't know if that's the time to introduce how you could be a complimentary partner to the memos ecosystem.

Speaker 2  2:08:58
It'd be nice if you talk to Jeremy after getting a testimonial from Brian or Kevin, right? Okay, Kevin, just drop me a note. Okay, don't reach out to Kevin or Brian tonight.

Speaker 1  2:09:22
It's Robert. I shot Robert an email at five, just to see, okay,

Speaker 4  2:09:28
okay. And I think I could it just, even just to follow up to Brian, see where it's, see where it's at, and see if, see if early, you know, by Tuesday as an option,

Speaker 2  2:09:42
my brain is fried. I'm happy to chat tomorrow.

Unknown Speaker  2:09:46
Let's but

Speaker 1  2:09:50
we're good. I don't know that I can we're good. Thanks for your help. Sleep soundly.

Speaker 2  2:09:57
Yeah, I. Like it's not, it's not a design PDF, but it's like, it's, it's all there, all there.

Unknown Speaker  2:10:10
And if, if it were, anyway, whatever,

Speaker 2  2:10:15
by the way I look at Dove stuff, and it's like it's, it's all Google Doc, you know, and his slides are just black text on white, you know. It's just, it's very, if the thinking is good, it's, it's sound

Unknown Speaker  2:10:36
very minimalistic, all right,

Unknown Speaker  2:10:41
get some good sleep. Take care of this. I will.

Unknown Speaker  2:10:43
Thanks. Thanks. Bye.
