Unknown Speaker  02:48
Hey, how's it going?

Unknown Speaker  02:49
Good? Uh,

Matthias Miller  02:51
random question, Have you ever talked with Ryan Albury, or has Josh long ever talked about I mean, Josh has talked about him online, but have you and Josh ever talked about him? Um,

Unknown Speaker  03:02
I had,

Speaker 1  03:06
I did, I did a program with Josh that Ryan did, like, one or two days of coaching for and Ryan's in the helpline, and we chat there. And I've had, I've had some chats with him personally. Uh, he's was going to church and was interested in resources on forgiveness. So I wouldn't, I wouldn't say I've got, like, a, like, we were going to jump on Zoom together, and didn't happen. But what's, what's coming up? How do you how do you come to mind?

Matthias Miller  03:50
Oh, I mean, I just chatted with him briefly. Josh has talked a good bit about him, and I don't know if this is the process of me continuing to externalize issues. I don't think it's completely that, but I think there's his his work on emotional patterns around sales, business, money. Make a lot of sense to

Speaker 1  04:20
me. What? What do you like about it? Um,

Matthias Miller  04:27
well, I mean, I think a lot of the internal work that I've been doing in other areas of life, um, little bit of a different angle, but leaning, but recognizing emotion around it, removing judgment from it, understanding the story, the origin, yeah, becoming friends with or embracing that part,

Speaker 1  04:57
yeah, yeah, I, I. It's hard. It's like, I think there's some value to what he says. I don't, I don't hold him up as a model, a life model, sure. I think I would hold Josh up as a life model, transaction. So he has, as he talked to you, about transactional awareness. I This is from his his webinar with Josh. HE, HE it's, you know, in the moment of a transaction where you feel something negative come up, you're at the gas pump, you see an IRS bill, right? Whatever the trigger is. This is where you practice awareness, so awareness of your choices, your thoughts, your emotions. Then you go to acceptance. You could list it out, awareness, acceptance. Then you how you want to approach, how you want to address and how you want to adjust. And I find that I thought that was a very like a pure model.

Speaker 1  06:27
Yeah, I think there's, it's always good to have, like one person at any time that you're looking for inner healing help. You know, so I know is, I'm imagining his new program is, is what you're considering

Unknown Speaker  06:50
about his new program, okay, well, if

Speaker 1  06:52
you're not aware, he's kicked, he's kicking off a

Unknown Speaker  07:01
money Matrix program, group program in September. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  07:15
it's pretty affordable. Maybe Ron i I've had very, very limited success with group programs, but okay, I may have prematurely dismissed

Speaker 1  07:28
it. That's fine. I think that's good. I i think one on ones are just the best accelerants. Yeah, because I think they someone can internalize the pattern of how what you're presenting and respond to that. And you can't do that without seeing someone. Yes, that's that's why I think the one on ones are powerful.

Matthias Miller  08:05
Yeah, well, I mean, there's, there's a lot of things, and there's also the focus attention and the customization that it's impossible to get.

Speaker 1  08:18
Well, hey, let me, let me walk you through a couple things. And by the way, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not stuck on any of this. But I think it's, I think it's a useful so I do not, I do not own, I do not have any font that's tied to the 100 proof you image that's on the website. So I just, I don't have, I just don't have any fonts I'm working out of. I don't, I don't know if there's like a coding font that you like, like a pro,

Unknown Speaker  09:02
what did you use?

Speaker 1  09:04
I used, I used chat, GBT, and gave it instructions to create, to create the type of of it looks like it's paint. It looks like it's painted on a wall.

Unknown Speaker  09:25
If you look closely, got it so that's so that's moving forward, there isn't a there isn't any font. I um for you. I used, I thought this was a I thought this was a decent font for the website. I used DM sans for everything. All right, okay, so let me

Unknown Speaker  10:12
try something here.

Speaker 1  10:16
So I could not think of, I could not think of a visual for 100 proof you and I didn't want to use alcohol. So you youth actually thought of one. Which was the distillery I forgot about, the truth distillery. That's great. The the original, okay, the original one was this, oh, I added, I added, welcome to the I wasn't sure about this. Was this, and I and this is going to be an going to be an intro to you. That was the original version. I could, I could have a sword here. So I'm, I was, I was looking at, give me a second. I

Unknown Speaker  11:23
I got it. I was looking at this,

Speaker 1  11:32
you know, kind of white paper by Chris sparks. He's great. And I was like, Oh, I could totally, I could totally model this. I I could totally, but maybe this isn't the right format, but let me, let me go back so I like potentially, potentially having, potentially any story. Um, the reason why I went to the the match is because, um, I looked at your I looked at the story, and it felt like there was something dying in you, and you needed, you just needed a fire in you, like there was like, like, there's a there's burnout, burnout success, but burnout on The the double edged sword, right? So, the the the I, I thought, I thought of a match because of the burnout, and then I thought of the actual 100, 100 proof alcohol is flammable. So that that was kind of like my connection, and I was, and this is a big stretch, but like, I wasn't sure if I could connect it to the battle the enemy line. Like the only thing I could think of was, like a Molotov cocktail. But that's not like that. So, so maybe I'm stretching it, but I the clearest, the most, okay, taking your idea of the distillery, I kind of like that,

Speaker 1  13:51
because the metal, the metal, the big metal piece, I wasn't sure what it was, just looking at it, here's a guy putting putting some effort in, right? And he's storing something that's valuable.

Unknown Speaker  14:12
Let's see

Speaker 1  14:16
so but, but either of these, the match and the distillery. Well, the distillery might be a little closer, but none of them quite connect to the battle, the battlefront. So that's, that's where I felt like, okay, maybe just a simple sword. Um, uh, or maybe, maybe so

Matthias Miller  14:45
blend the ideas, black background, completely solid black background, remove the truth distiller, distillery, Invert Colors and use that very short, punchy tagline that you had. Um. And on the last distillery when undiluted clarity connection encourages Yes, I just

Unknown Speaker  15:06
switched the image out with and then this could be okay. Yeah, I could do that. I I

Speaker 1  15:29
don't know if you could take you could take this and remove your I don't know how many credits you have.

Matthias Miller  15:48
Well here, let's also

Unknown Speaker  15:53
probably not a pitchfork. I

Unknown Speaker  16:04
let me try something here.

Unknown Speaker  16:11
So if you have, if you have a sword, I don't know if the top Heading should be the distillery,

Matthias Miller  16:25
right? I agree. I don't know that you even need it.

Unknown Speaker  16:29
Okay, that's fair. I mean, you could say, you could say who it's for.

Speaker 1  16:38
Oh, oh, this was, this was one thing I forgot to talk about. So you could talk about Forge and fire, Andrew preview, and then the sword, and then the text in red,

Speaker 1  16:58
potentially the other thing was, I talked, I thought about, I thought about, maybe you're not talking to founders, but a foundry, that's where you get the word founder, right? Foundry works with metals. That's like a blacksmithy.

Matthias Miller  17:25
I think it's too clever. I think I think it just needs to be simple, and to the point we have 100 proof view. We've got two metaphors underproof and and battle.

Speaker 1  17:35
Can I say Forge and fire at the top, or just leave it blank, um, but

Matthias Miller  17:45
that's the third metaphor.

Speaker 1  17:48
Okay, I just thought it tied to the sword.

Matthias Miller  17:54
It does and the battle, but the battle is, the battle is, yeah, but we don't talk about the development of the sword. We just talked about the weapons that are being used. Okay, great. And winning the battle, great. Let's see it.

Speaker 1  18:09
Well, send me, send me the icon, and I can, I can stop this.

Matthias Miller  18:16
Um, let me see. Okay, I don't know if this one

Unknown Speaker  18:30
sure drives.

Unknown Speaker  18:35
Okay, I'm dropping in the drive now, right?

Unknown Speaker  18:40
I should have done that to begin with. Thanks.

Unknown Speaker  18:50
Okay. I did do, I did do a pass on your manifesto. It was, it was,

Unknown Speaker  19:11
I could sit down with it more.

Unknown Speaker  19:22
The think

Matthias Miller  19:23
it could be worth I did a pass as well. I think it could be worth going through it together. Yeah, you can do that through some stuff. I've got about an hour or about 50 minutes before I had to drop off again.

Speaker 1  19:39
Did you say for the weekend. No, no. Drop off. Again, again, okay, yeah, let me know when you want to

Matthias Miller  19:51
start. Let's do, let me, let me just pull it up. Okay, one of the big picture, big picture questions, there's a blend of, I we do. Any of us, what perspective is this coming from? Is this a

Matthias Miller  20:12
is this a universal? Is this universal? Is this biographical? Is it is it a combination? And I just noticed this. It was kind of a weird like many of us started at zero. I did this.

Speaker 1  20:39
Okay, hell is meeting the man I could have been who I was into 100 proof version.

Matthias Miller  20:46
Then here's the transition. We just helped

Unknown Speaker  20:48
this. Basically, you could say, you could maybe you could say you're in the next bit, you're gonna Like, share your story.

Speaker 1  21:17
You're gonna share this work. Is a culmination of my thinking, right? Is the story of the battles I fought and Okay, I

Unknown Speaker  21:52
me centered,

Unknown Speaker  21:53
Yeah, you could Say

Matthias Miller  22:02
you I mean, I don't know what transition,

Speaker 1  23:07
but when I say transition, it's that they didn't know the word manifesto, except that That's maybe the front page.

Unknown Speaker  23:18
So it's

Speaker 1  23:21
I have, you know, I've distilled, I've just, I've distilled the work into this manifesto.

Unknown Speaker  23:41
Or maybe you're maybe it's you're extending an invitation. Yeah, I

Matthias Miller  24:08
can we just do that? Can mix? Mix this? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  24:23
okay, maybe I

Speaker 2  25:14
That makes sense This.

Unknown Speaker  26:25
Yeah, this is, that's where you could say, battles. I

Unknown Speaker  26:49
You could say wounds,

Unknown Speaker  26:52
wounds, sure. Go ahead. I good

Speaker 1  27:09
and victories on the past becoming the 100 per feet. There we go. There we go. I'm

Speaker 1  27:26
and this works because it's it, it outlines. I mean, that's what you want to do in The intro, to refuse to settle. Right?

Unknown Speaker  27:54
Settle for the

Unknown Speaker  28:03
Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  28:13
okay, I like it. I

Speaker 1  28:15
mean, you want to say to the men who refuse to settle. I

Unknown Speaker  28:25
I know that's a big decision.

Unknown Speaker  28:29
I'm not quite ready yet. Okay, um,

Unknown Speaker  28:31
I won't push you on that. I've already pushed you tomorrow.

Matthias Miller  28:36
You might not be wrong, but Okay, all right, so here's, here's where it's, it's, you know, can you

Speaker 1  28:53
say, Do you like enemy line or behind enemy lines?

Unknown Speaker  29:02
And the enemy line is where the battle is happening. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  29:07
basis is

Unknown Speaker  29:22
this.

Unknown Speaker  29:39
I don't know.

Speaker 1  29:48
Maybe this manifesto shares my story. Can you say this manifesto shares the story? Of my battles, wounds and victories,

Unknown Speaker  30:04
that, sure, and then

Matthias Miller  30:10
that gives me permission to share my story,

Speaker 1  30:11
right? I then you can go directly into it without this switch.

Matthias Miller  30:19
Shares my story. One thing I wanted to do is move this up here. I'm

Speaker 1  30:50
I think what third grade and third place?

Unknown Speaker  31:04
And Alan actually wasn't third

Speaker 1  31:14
student. I went third place in our regional math contest. I

Matthias Miller  31:24
I don't even remember the the specific number. I just remember it felt like a huge it had to have been hundreds. Yeah, I don't

Speaker 1  31:36
against how many school districts in our against many other school districts, a regional math contest. I think that's good. I

Matthias Miller  32:08
I think that says enough about the significance of it.

Unknown Speaker  32:20
Yep, There we go.

Speaker 1  32:37
I There needs to be some connection. It could be placing against hundreds of other students, and now you placed against hundreds of other job applicants there, but there needs to be some transition to fast forwarding so many years I

Matthias Miller  34:00
I mean, that's really the there. There weren't hundreds of applicants. It was door propped open for me,

Speaker 1  34:18
years, you could say, years later I found financial I found early financial success.

Matthias Miller  34:31
Quite the right term. I mean, the opportunity was granted, but I was prepared. I don't

Speaker 1  34:36
think you need, the need to say that you just, you just say, I I, I developed that financial success developing software. I.

Unknown Speaker  35:13
Just say, years later,

Unknown Speaker  35:19
years later. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  35:24
long time it was out of right, out of high school, for 10 years later,

Unknown Speaker  35:41
you could say, as a

Matthias Miller  35:45
young adult, started my career with early financial success.

Speaker 1  35:52
I like years later I found early financial success because it's like you didn't have it up until then. Success developing software for top banks and insurance companies. Just great.

Speaker 1  36:16
What? What are the names of the banks or insurance companies? Okay?

Unknown Speaker  36:21
Say, Okay,

Unknown Speaker  36:24
you would know,

Unknown Speaker  36:41
passed over for promotion.

Matthias Miller  36:46
Was that passed over by promotion? I never, I mean, here's the weird thing, I never specifically asked for promotion, okay, but it was never considered for one Yeah Or No, yeah,

Speaker 1  36:56
that's the same thing. Fair enough. I um,

Unknown Speaker  37:38
oh, here's a way of saying it is

Speaker 1  37:49
I I had, I had I had. I had my I had financial. Financial financial something success. But I was back, was back to my, back to back to my feeling, feelings of failure. Or I was back to my it's like, maybe you moved ahead, but you internally you didn't feel like it. It's like you were back to being a kid.

Unknown Speaker  38:34
I The the the foundation, the commendations, the for exceptional never, never translated into a promotion, yeah, I guess we had the same idea. I

Speaker 1  39:33
again, again and feeling like a failure. Yeah, yep, I.

Unknown Speaker  40:35
But less my, but But less my. I?

Speaker 1  40:43
Left me. Left my real self, my left knee. I like the left me in crisis. I

Unknown Speaker  41:05
i could say unfulfilled.

Unknown Speaker  41:17
I became obsessed with wedding.

Speaker 1  41:21
I like the personal angle more than switching back to we, yeah, right, it really flows. Because the manifesto is it's, it is your personal story. I

Unknown Speaker  41:44
I found

Matthias Miller  41:58
was I obsessed with winning? I don't know, in some ways, I wouldn't consider myself to have been like that. But on the other hand, the sheer determination, it's hard to say that I wasn't,

Speaker 1  42:10
I think, with proving myself, myself by compete by competing with others, yes, my definition, my,

Speaker 1  42:37
oh, I could say you could say my, something about your definition of success was warped.

Speaker 1  42:52
You could say this definition success this warped at

Unknown Speaker  43:11
is this?

Matthias Miller  43:16
Did I really obsess over competing with others i

Unknown Speaker  43:31
i suppose there's a creative tell you where he

Speaker 1  43:36
was. Well, what, where was the time you competed? I I

Matthias Miller  43:48
mean, it was pretty early on before I started looking at other options.

Unknown Speaker  43:53
But you could say, you could say by competing with others. I I mean, you could talk about when I compared myself to others,

Unknown Speaker  44:13
right?

Unknown Speaker  44:14
This was rested.

Matthias Miller  44:31
No, it is true when you frame it like that, I compare myself to others, always looking for ways to move my to move myself. I

Unknown Speaker  44:47
to elevate my status, i.

Unknown Speaker  46:12
Yeah, I do Like this formulation. I

Matthias Miller  46:24
This is really weird. I think part of it is coming to grips with myself. I've never I've never considered myself. I uh, sorry, you're getting a therapy moment. My wife hated playing games with me as a when we got married, because it was either I'm going to win or I'm not going to play. What rightly or wrongly. I'm not advocating this as a parenting policy, but when one of our kids was a little too big for their britches with checkers, I took them on. And, I mean, I'm not

Matthias Miller  47:19
saying Everything about it was good but, but I think I tuned it out and said I'm not competitive, so I didn't have to deal with I lied to myself, really, I didn't I hate I hated losing so badly that I lied to myself and told me that I wasn't competitive.

Matthias Miller  47:58
That's weird. It's weird the stories we tell ourselves, it would be impossible to say that I'm not competitive.

Unknown Speaker  48:13
I think this is great because it's this is what it is you hate Losing so badly. I

Unknown Speaker  48:37
and I, I would say, I

Unknown Speaker  48:51
my peers, carrying myself my

Matthias Miller  48:57
it wasn't just my peers, dude, this is so twisted, messed up. I was consistently, I consistently bat against. I mean, I think it's toned down. It's shifted in the last few years, like there's less of this. But I was consistently trying to bat against the people the next level up from my peers, sure,

Unknown Speaker  49:33
I Don't know you call them

Matthias Miller  49:39
comparing, comparing comparing myself against people 10 years more experienced than

Speaker 1  49:48
I. I think the story of taking, taking that sense of failure home and competing is worth adding one line because a. So it's because there's a this is a life dynamic, and people will connect with having failed in one place and bringing that home.

Unknown Speaker  50:22
I have done this all my life.

Speaker 1  50:27
I think you could do it here. I wasn't even though I would come home and and I

Speaker 1  50:45
I'm trying to beat my kids at checkers, or what you said about your wife, I thought was, I thought that was an instructive point. I

Unknown Speaker  51:04
Yep,

Unknown Speaker  51:13
that sucks, but it's true. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  51:21
Some

Unknown Speaker  51:25
I had I had been

Unknown Speaker  51:42
pushed. Myself.

Speaker 1  51:58
I couldn't help but measure myself against people.

Matthias Miller  52:05
I think it could just be that I measure myself against people with 10 years

Unknown Speaker  52:09
more experience, yeah, okay, that I wasn't competitive.

Unknown Speaker  52:22
There you go. That's a good

Unknown Speaker  52:39
you could say this is hard for me to say today.

Speaker 1  52:58
It's this is this is where you're practicing self disclosure, right, right? That's the

Unknown Speaker  53:27
you went but when your your family gets to fall out,

Speaker 2  53:35
gets to fall out, it's a Yeah,

Speaker 1  53:46
you could, I mean, you're, it's easy to say, like, Hey, I'm doing all this work for my family, and then make them pay, pay for your

Unknown Speaker  53:55
pay for it, right? Um,

Speaker 1  54:07
well, I didn't, I was going to have a blog, and I guess I never quite got, got into it, but this, this is the one post I had at this event. Chad shared how no amount of success can compensate for failure in the home. Thought that was really good. Yes,

Unknown Speaker  54:39
need some water. You.

Unknown Speaker  55:52
Just give me two minutes.

Speaker 3  55:53
Great. Sounds good? I'll break as Well. You

Speaker 1  58:52
some watermelon juice in the freezer So it's ice cold right now.

Unknown Speaker  58:58
Nice

Speaker 1  59:02
Mexicans. Have a lot of man, it used to be a couple years ago. If you ask for water, they would give you fruit flavored like a blended you'd have to say, I want simple water. Simple water.

Matthias Miller  59:21
It's kind of like the French and flat water

Speaker 1  59:27
when I when I discovered watermelon juice is just so easy to make, you just blend in. It's like, yeah, summer is my favorite time of year. Now,

Matthias Miller  59:37
that's awesome. We have a watermelon growing accidentally, leftover from previous owners of our property in the corner of the garden, and it's this massive. I don't know it's probably it's easily eight feet in diameter. And we have as long as the deer don't get it. We've got a watermelon growing on it so they

Unknown Speaker  59:58
can bite, bite through it. Wow.

Matthias Miller  1:00:01
Well, I mean, they've, they've gone through Well, I mean, who knows, trample on it, sit on it. Oh, sure, sure. I don't know if they'll bite it or not. They've tried every other kind of zucchini, squash, every other kind of vegetable that we've had. So tomatoes are a great vine. Anyway, it's, I'm noxious.

Speaker 1  1:00:22
I have a friend has this beautiful garden, and it's, it's like, it's like a half an acre that he's just, it's like, it's like someone's private garden, but it's like a half an acre, and he had to do all of this fencing and work, and it looks like he's got a fortress, like a fort out there, but it's just for the deers.

Matthias Miller  1:00:50
Yeah, and the city has an ordinance that it can't the fence can't be more than six feet, and so the previous owners had put hog wire up to like, I don't know what, eight, eight feet, at least, which, which kept him out. So I think the only, my only hope is either a dog or privacy fence, and hoping that if they can't see over the top, that they'll stay out. But, I mean, they can easily clear six feet. That's no problem for them. It's just hopefully, if they can't see the other side, they won't. They won't, dare,

Unknown Speaker  1:01:20
I bet they could jump six feet.

Matthias Miller  1:01:22
Oh yeah. They're just yeah, they, they cleared more than more than six. I mean, just because of sloping neighborhoods of one, that's six and a half or seven and yeah.

Speaker 1  1:01:37
All right, what section are you on

Unknown Speaker  1:01:42
lonely? Okay, I

Unknown Speaker  1:01:46
let's, let's just read this from the top. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:01:57
I would do this. I

Speaker 1  1:02:07
can I say and just do comma, measuring myself against people? Sure. Okay, I'm losing so badly that lighting myself I

Speaker 1  1:02:38
um, should I Say table Games? Sure.

Speaker 1  1:03:02
Uh, I think, I think you don't need this line because the previous here you you talk about, Right? You already talk about isolation.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:56
That's good. Oops. I

Unknown Speaker  1:04:31
Oh,

Speaker 1  1:04:35
I don't think climbing the competency hierarchy I added that. I don't think it works, because you're not in a big business. Sure you're at the top, fear the owner. Oh, you could have competency hierarchy here, up somewhere here, I.

Speaker 2  1:05:05
That's okay. I

Unknown Speaker  1:05:32
you could say,

Unknown Speaker  1:05:36
my pride, uh,

Unknown Speaker  1:05:48
yeah, moving belief, I could, I I could. I could do better, better in business, online, on my own. I think there's a way of condensing this. You don't need to talk about

Unknown Speaker  1:06:21
believed I

Speaker 1  1:06:23
think you could just say my pride, because they might, they might not relate to arrogance, but I think they could relate to pride. Yeah,

Speaker 1  1:06:42
except you say own, but you're you're partnering.

Speaker 1  1:06:52
I guess maybe the here is versus your bosses. I well,

Matthias Miller  1:07:09
I mean, it started on my own, then I went in with partner.

Speaker 1  1:07:14
Yeah, I I I

Matthias Miller  1:07:24
mean, technically, they were a client, not a business partner. So my
