Speaker 1  03:19
As fishers, if you want me to take them out for you, I'd be happy

Matthias Miller  03:24
to yo bud, yo Happy Tuesday.

Unknown Speaker  03:25
Hey, happy Tuesday, buddy. Here we go. Are we screen? Share? What do you

Matthias Miller  03:38
okay? So we got two. So needs help cleaning up cut list. Cut list stuff, yep, um, so we can I get, I can screen share on my end, and we can some of this stuff. Could be pretty quick if we if there's stuff that we can all do same way, everywhere.

Unknown Speaker  04:01
Yeah.

Matthias Miller  04:04
Sorry. Go ahead. And then we also have some assembly tracker stuff. I just want to run past you make sure

Speaker 2  04:11
I told George we're going to start on that so he's not here yet. I'll I just saw your email. Sorry, I didn't. I did not I was, yeah, I didn't get to inbox till just a little bit ago. I was in some meetings. Um, send me look here. What am I doing? Um,

Unknown Speaker  04:41
no, now I'm going out of place here,

Speaker 2  04:45
right here. You see me your email. Can I go through this with you quick? So, yeah, totally, notes I had, and I know we oh, sorry, um, do you remember what we talked about Fridays regarding sample pallets and. Repaired pallets. I

Matthias Miller  05:01
didn't think we got to that topic. Had we gotten to that topic? What's that, Matt, I thought we didn't get to that topic. Okay, so

Speaker 2  05:11
then we did it, but so I didn't look at this. So you're proposing heat treating and repairs replace the current non heat treated item. What is sorry, current non heat treated item.

Matthias Miller  05:35
Okay, so heat treated items may be assembled as the non heat treated equivalent, like you might, you might have an order of this many non heat treated, this many heat treated. So we just assemble them as the non heat treated item, and we just know that they get passed on for heat heat treatment later

Unknown Speaker  05:55
one, yeah.

Matthias Miller  05:57
And so this is the same way. So basically, currently we're saying, if you have on the on the heat treated item in silver loom, you can go in and you can say, here's the item code for the non heat treated equivalent.

Speaker 2  06:20
Okay, but they they already have separate item codes, right?

Matthias Miller  06:24
Yes, they do, but we want to assemble them together at the same time into the same work order, instead of, instead of trying to split how much time one or the other. So we just all we want to do is we want to say we assemble this item code, but be able to tie it out to sales orders for either the heat treated or the non heat treated item. Okay,

Speaker 2  06:47
so are you thinking of all items that are not HT as this non heat treated item?

Matthias Miller  06:56
Well, I mean, only you would go into all HT items. And for each HT item you would, you would link it back to the non HT item if it has one.

Speaker 2  07:10
Okay, my brain's working too slow, right now. All good, maybe, perfectly good. Yeah, for any we set to the for any heat treated items, this would be set to the non

Unknown Speaker  07:32
heat treated item for any customer name.

Unknown Speaker  07:41
Okay,

Matthias Miller  07:44
so it's two ways, six of one and a half dozen of the other. Either you say, here's an item that we sell and this item is assembled. You know, sometimes we assemble it as a repair right as a non, or we go the other way and say, here's this item that we assemble. Sometimes we sell it as right, and it's six and one and a half dozen of the other. It's just whatever makes most

Speaker 2  08:08
sense to you. Well, I don't see any issues with with with this. Um, are we? Are we having issues current? Sorry, what are the current issue with Sure, the heat treating.

Matthias Miller  08:21
Current issue with heat treating is that when you get an order for 27 pallets and 20 or seven, are you treated in 20 or not, we don't know how to split that up.

Unknown Speaker  08:30
Well, I thought we had

Speaker 2  08:31
that. I thought we I thought we had that figured out with the sage.

Matthias Miller  08:36
We do that part is working okay. But now with with repairs. Repairs are basically the same thing as heat treatment, where you're going to assemble it as a repair, but then you're you're going to sell it as the customer code, yeah. And so heat treatment works fine, and I'm just proposing that instead of just keeping it focused on heat treatment, we expand it further, make it a little bit more general, so so that instead of just saying heat treated versus not heat treated, it's well, we assemble it as this, but sometimes sell it. Sell it like this, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  09:19
okay, and that should be, sorry,

Matthias Miller  09:22
yeah, and that should, that should handle your repairs then, because you'll repair it under your repair item code, and then sell it under the customer item code, yeah,

Speaker 2  09:32
if you have that, man, if that's not a big, complicated process on your side, is that? How? How much is that on your side?

Matthias Miller  09:41
Um, this, well, okay, let me ask the question first, does it matter which direction it points

Speaker 2  09:53
to you? Sorry, like, do you go contact? So I'm going to do direction

Matthias Miller  10:01
sure on a repair Do you want to, do you want to go on the repair item and say, here are all the customer items? Or do you want to go to the customer item and say, this is sometimes built as a repair item? Does it matter which item screen you put this on?

Speaker 2  10:27
Well, yes, I think so, right? Because if we lump it all under the customer item, and it might get sold to a different customer and then,

Matthias Miller  10:37
well, no, you'll still assemble it. The Assembly Tracker will still

Speaker 2  10:41
assemble. It has to be more specific. Is, is that right? Like we have to be more specific in what we call it. It's, it's gonna be a little harder to specify what it is.

Matthias Miller  10:55
If, if, if we, if we just, all we would have to do is rename the non heat treated item to assembled as Yeah. Just rename it like that, yeah, and and it just basically becomes renames and everything just works.

Speaker 2  11:17
It's a simpler, right? Am I right? It's simpler up front, it's simpler in the tracking is that, is that? How

Matthias Miller  11:26
does it? The tracking doesn't no matter how we go about it, the tracking will work the same, no matter we whether we go with Option A or Option B. Okay, sure.

Speaker 2  11:44
And we need, we need something for the repairs. And if you, if that links it to the to the to the sale of that, of that repair later. I mean, that's, that's great, then, then the chain is intact, yeah, okay, sure makes sense. I

Matthias Miller  12:08
mean, you would on the repair I think you would when you sell, when you when you get a customer order in, you would have to go back to you find your older repair order and move some of that quantity to the customer sales order, the same as we did we handle it would basically work like A stock item,

Unknown Speaker  12:33
yeah. Okay,

Speaker 2  12:39
if it was your company? What would you do?

Matthias Miller  12:49
That's a great question. It makes sense that repairs are stock items that is legitimately what It

Matthias Miller  13:02
is. The other way I may potentially handle it.

Matthias Miller  13:24
Okay, another potential way to handle it is, is almost like an item, reas like a code reassignment, but that doesn't handle.

Matthias Miller  13:41
Sorry, there's too much, too many levels to this. If I'm optimizing for something simple that just works, yeah, that's good enough. I would just rename the non heat treated item as assembled as, or assembly alternative,

Unknown Speaker  14:00
no somewhat as it's great, yeah.

Matthias Miller  14:03
I mean, if we're just again, if we're just avoid over complicating that is, that is a simple, most direct path. I'm happy. I would not have any issue with that.

Speaker 2  14:14
Yep. So there is one

Matthias Miller  14:17
little nuance on the reporting of do you then, do we need to change the reports to report on what was actually sold, because the value? Yeah,

Speaker 2  14:34
yeah. Well, I mean, first off, we don't want to report it twice. So the question is, do we report it when it's repaired, or do we report it when it's sold? We're, we are. Our reports are a direct what's the word man, they so we, in order to. Run incentive program. We need real time, real time production and real time hours. So to get real time production, we would need to report it when it was built or

Matthias Miller  15:12
repaired. Yes, yep, which means that we would have to treat it as well, but on heat treated items, okay? On repairs, repairs, it doesn't matter, like most likely by the time, I mean, they might not sell until after the pay period anyway, so you're just going to have to use the value of a repair, right? But on a heat treated item, it's very likely that the heat treated item will make it within the pay period. Do you? Do you treat those as, if they do them all as non heat treated? Can we just say, put in the production value of the non heat treated? Yeah? Okay, so it's just based on the code that they assembled. I like it. Yeah. It's fine. And if they get a big order of heat treated items, they get a little their it bumps their production value, right? Whoopty, whoop

Unknown Speaker  16:03
okay,

Speaker 2  16:04
it's yes, it's yeah, it's not Yeah, it's not that's good enough,

Matthias Miller  16:07
okay? And then for sample pallets, my proposal is just treat them like stock items, which means

Unknown Speaker  16:15
I'm gonna call George quick. Okay?

Speaker 2  16:23
Yeah, we're wrapping up, buddy, thanks. Yeah, sample pallets, stock items, um, yeah, and

Matthias Miller  16:32
you just never get any. The biggest issue is, okay, you'll never get a sales order for them. So fine, like, we'll just build up a big stock of sample pallets, and if we ever need to clear them out, somehow, we'll come up with a way to do that. But let's not cross that bridge while we get until we get there. The only issue is, if we don't have any sales orders, we don't know how to report

Speaker 2  16:53
production value for them. Value, yeah, so we could

Matthias Miller  16:58
give a manual. We could give you a way on a, yep, on an item, to give you a manual price over, like a total price, I guess,

Speaker 2  17:09
yeah. What the easiest way to do that, I believe, is just going by board footage, if we have a yes, is it George's? Is every sample pallet that we make? Yeah, no, they're not necessarily being entered into the item that so we don't have that, okay, yeah, if we have an order, is it still a sample, I guess it is, yeah, sometimes, sorry, Matt, I'm not, yeah. What are you thinking?

Matthias Miller  17:50
Well, I wish there would be a way. I don't know how you would do this. What would simplify my life is if, whatever the value of the pallet is, you would create a sage order for and you would apply some kind of discount to zero it out and close it out so that we would have a value, a production value for it. But that's, you know, that's me being lazy and saying, let's let them and then we handle it on a per order basis, you just have per order pricing, which I'm not sure if we actually which raises another issue. I think our production value is using a latest order pricing, not the specific order it was produced for. So generally doesn't matter, but could be an issue.

Unknown Speaker  18:46
I'm

Speaker 2  18:54
just trying to and like we could so, so when they get, so when they got, when we're doing this, what if the guys on the floor, if the guys in assembly, we're tracking their hours every day, if they are asked To do a job, that is, say, cleaning the room, cleaning the ceiling, painting the wall, anything that's not production. I mean, if it's not production time, setup time, changing all that, if it's none, so then we would, we're going to have to call that company time, right? Because it's not production time. We could, hey, you're building a sample pallet. Let's just call that company time for the sake of

Unknown Speaker  19:56
the program. Yes,

Speaker 2  19:59
because. Because even if there's a value added to a sample pal, the time they spend on one sample could be way overboard, you know, for the value produced. So, yeah, do

Matthias Miller  20:13
we even need to enter into the assembly tracker? Can we just tell

Speaker 2  20:17
Yeah, I think, I think that's No, I think we do not need to. I don't think, I mean, well, we have downtime. What we yeah, we have the downtime category. So it could fall into the downtime category,

Matthias Miller  20:34
or, I don't know

Speaker 2  20:35
if we call it down, is it non production time, whatever we call that.

Matthias Miller  20:40
I mean, we can, if you want an assembly tracker, what makes the most sense is to say this is a non production item, effectively, or a, this is a, I mean, maybe we'll just call them all sample ballots. I mean, it's, it's all that is what it is, yeah, yeah. And just excluded everywhere. But if, if you don't actually need to know how much time was spent, we could just say, Look, we know that sample pallets are just company overhead. We're not going to put them in the assembly tracker.

Speaker 2  21:12
Good English. George, what's your opinion on that? Do you think should track time spent all sample? Samples?

Unknown Speaker  21:21
No, yeah, yeah,

Speaker 2  21:32
true you or Steve, right? I mean, which is, yeah, I think we're good, Matt with it. We'll just leave it as a downtime. Entry, okay, non production time entry, whatever, what, whatever currently on the Yeah.

Matthias Miller  21:50
So do you want a checkbox that basically makes it all be non production time actually, that would be pretty easy to implement now that I think about

Unknown Speaker  22:01
it, sorry, a checkbox.

Matthias Miller  22:03
Checkbox on the item that indicates it's a sample pallet, which means that the assembly time basically always is zero.

Speaker 2  22:10
So he would enter, so we would do the entry, and we would have history that way, right?

Matthias Miller  22:17
Yes, yeah. I'm

Speaker 2  22:19
asked, I think if it's that simple, yeah, then we might as well do it that way.

Matthias Miller  22:24
Yep. I didn't think about the time we can. I mean, we could just choke it off at the

Speaker 2  22:29
it creates a it creates a measure, yep, of accountability and the matters. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  22:37
okay, and we don't have to cover this one sage. We have George's here, but we do have orders in sage that were delivered, but our mark is back ordered. Okay, so I don't I think Rick, Rick Hartman had a had an email to you asking if, if you want him to work with with Rick or Tina, and getting that cleaned up for or we can also handle, we can handle it in the software, but it seems to me like an accounting issue we shouldn't have, yeah, shouldn't have shipped a back ordered item.

Unknown Speaker  23:12
Is there a date range for this specific, this specific thing?

Matthias Miller  23:20
See, let me see if I can

Unknown Speaker  23:23
find that we're looking at, or that's

Matthias Miller  23:26
we have. I have a list of, I don't know, 50 different ones, but there's, there's a number of very specific sales orders that John is like, if you go back in the history of the deleted orders email, in my initial email, it's actually at the bottom of your screen, Friday, 822 at 1:30pm that one's got the 79872, there is One of them that has an issue.

Unknown Speaker  24:01
822 deleted orders, gotcha. And

Matthias Miller  24:04
then that also has a full list of all of them. But I don't, I don't think we have to go back. And I would expect you want to fix 2025, for accounting purposes, but, but probably don't need to go back beyond that? Yeah, no. Well we might need for importing higher No, we're not linking history. So

Unknown Speaker  24:30
coming across from Sage was an X status, meaning it was deleted in sage.

Matthias Miller  24:42
Well, that's that's a deleted stage or flag, but if you go to Rick Hartman's reply,

Unknown Speaker  24:48
okay,

Matthias Miller  24:51
then you'll see it's actually some reason the order was marked as back ordered.

Speaker 2  24:56
I reviewed several these, found that while there were invoice. Right the sales order was marked.

Unknown Speaker  25:05
Understand this shows the

Unknown Speaker  25:08
sales order is marked as a back order type

Unknown Speaker  25:13
with deleted status.

Speaker 2  25:22
Okay, I did not read this, but I know if you like interview the president,

Unknown Speaker  25:28
okay, okay, okay,

Unknown Speaker  25:31
they're showing insult status

Unknown Speaker  25:33
is deleted, all right. I will

Speaker 2  25:37
definitely look into this with Rick. Uh, gamble. Matt, okay, okay, awesome. Do you just to I'm guessing what happened. I'm guessing what happened here, actually, uh, at least in some maybe all is in order got moved to a different date. Or, you know, something changed with an order, it got pushed back and a new, maybe a new order was created, or, I don't know, I'm, yeah, sorry, it doesn't matter. It's it needs, I get it. So how are, how are these affecting? Are these affecting, like, also on the tracking side of things. Now,

Matthias Miller  26:43
yeah, so yeah, because they're back ordered, John T isn't able to select them to tie them out, and I can allow him to. It just seems to me like, yeah, the root causes. They shouldn't be flagged as backward.

Speaker 2  27:02
This is going to keep causing issues if, if it's a Yeah, process issue right,

Matthias Miller  27:11
right now, if this is a soft, if this is a sage limitation, and this is just the way it's supposed to be, again, it's not complicated to work around it, but, if it's a process issue, let's fix the process issue. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  27:26
yeah, okay,

Speaker 2  27:31
all right, I'll catch up on that with Rick after this meeting. Okay. Other otherwise, Matt on those topics, anything else? Nope, that's it good. Okay, thank you. John is saying that there was something with he said there was two things yet that were hanging out, he cleaned up a lot of those entries, or he said, he said, I cleaned up everything but the scent, either sample or repair entries he didn't finish. And there's a time at situation. Does that tie into this here? Last topic, yeah, the time, that's the back stuff. That's some of the sales history stuff. Okay, yeah, good. All right. All right, okay, yeah. Where do we go next? All right, let me

Matthias Miller  28:41
go to here. Let me Yeah. It was might be easier if I share my screen.

Unknown Speaker  28:53
Okay,

Unknown Speaker  28:54
sure, show you guys.

Matthias Miller  29:01
So I put together a report with these issues, all right, so we have here. So basically, we have a whole bunch of stuff in size or miscellaneous prep, and we need to, we need to move a bunch of stuff over to sawing, and so I grouped a bunch of this stuff together based on keywords. And I think,

Matthias Miller  29:36
I think if we i

Matthias Miller  29:44
Uh, hang on, let's do, I think, I think we could probably make some broad notes about what needs to happen, and, and, and maybe I'm trying to think if there's a better way to clean this up. Run. It's about what makes this happen. And I can probably update most of this stuff pretty.

Speaker 3  30:08
Yeah, because mostly everything you yellow flat or made in yellow matte, it's pertaining to salt, the Saw Shop, not like a sizers. So I think what had happened we all we had everything under one category. We didn't have sewing sewing prep, and we didn't have our sewing prep and sizer prep. And I think that's what's throwing everything off. Okay, two categories, you don't mean I still have stuff in salt or sizer prep, and it should be installing prep.

Speaker 2  30:44
Well, did we have only one miscellaneous prep category? Is that what?

Unknown Speaker  30:49
Well, a while back, yeah, in

Unknown Speaker  30:51
ESCO,

Matthias Miller  30:52
can we just do a fell swoop? If sewing miscellaneous prep is blank, just move size or miscellaneous prep over into that. Is that all? Is that all that needs to happen?

Speaker 3  31:01
I think I saw these hell because I haven't had that do any edit. I mean, any editing I've been doing was moving stuff from size or prep to sewing.

Speaker 2  31:11
So how many items are left? Matt, 1925

Matthias Miller  31:19
like even, even hardwood, even even this would be moving to sewing,

Unknown Speaker  31:28
yeah, because that's all plywood.

Matthias Miller  31:31
Okay. I mean, I'm happy to that's easy. We can, we can. That's easy to do. We can do that. I don't mind doing that well,

Speaker 2  31:44
even if it says, like mHw mixed hardwood, there's some

Speaker 3  31:54
popular you know, but I haven't, I haven't found anything.

Speaker 2  31:58
So it's much, much more likely it's under should be under sizer, like, if everything just went from sawing in the size or miscellaneous prep, I mean, from sizer in the sawing. There may be few that are aren't accurate, but then you have to come back and

Speaker 1  32:18
but I think it's going to fix about 98% of what's happening right

Unknown Speaker  32:22
now. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  32:24
I think

Speaker 3  32:27
is that why it's showing up Matt that because it's in size or prep. It's saying I don't have, like, Brewer, Keystone or scalpy in there.

Matthias Miller  32:38
No, it's because, because, because that's a separate issue. That issue is that there's a lot of things that, and I don't know how much of it, I mean, do you literally not have a size or on most of these items? Can we? Can we do one thing at a time just before we get completely Yeah, maybe never mind. Let me just make a note. I'll do this. I'll do this offline. So we will do on the move.

Speaker 2  33:11
You're good, Matt, you're good. Man, do your thing. All right, let's do your thing. We got

Matthias Miller  33:16
five minutes, and we'll have this thing, this problem, completely licked, and we can move on with our lives. You're good.

Speaker 2  33:27
Let's just do what's Yeah, take your time, man. You're fine, all right.

Speaker 4  33:37
Oh, you could with the schedule for guys and stuff out there no Curtis next to you with mouth. Last two nights. Look to mouth. Last night was man

Unknown Speaker  33:51
about conversion, or what do you call it?

Unknown Speaker  33:56
I had to look it up because I had never heard of my

Unknown Speaker  33:58
light. I don't know, it

Unknown Speaker  34:01
usually happens with a baby

Unknown Speaker  34:03
or a kid. That's what it says. It

Unknown Speaker  34:05
could happen to adults. So, yeah, I've heard it

Speaker 1  34:08
before, but I've never heard a foot when he said it this morning, like, Okay. And then other than that word, I mean, now your dad wants two twins for the mom for a couple hours. It'll make it work.

Speaker 4  34:24
I wish you do different back and see when I'm like, an Apps afternoon for a

Unknown Speaker  34:27
little bit, but

Unknown Speaker  34:31
good on schedule. Yeah, we can't miss a beat, darling. Is that right?

Speaker 3  34:42
Is that, Hey, Matt, while you're there, I know the flag in cut list generator, the no assembly required, and stock item, can you elaborate on those three boxes there? Yep, let me Give me. Give me about alright. I. Fine.

Unknown Speaker  35:06
Yep,

Speaker 1  35:07
this was missing. This was missing. She moved this from this week to next week. It didn't go to the generator.

Speaker 1  35:21
It's there if you go into new orders, and it's like the those not between generate to

Unknown Speaker  35:38
first time that happened, something like that happened.

Speaker 1  35:43
Oh yeah, but these two completely were, I can't find them on the finished, finished items are not completed.

Speaker 2  35:51
Is that the ones that yesterday were missing?

Speaker 1  35:55
You know, we had this one. The end of the day, Jerry came in, so I'd change all my salt or any just that's the essay number. That's the essay number for that one. Like I said, I'm running down completed items. I can't find them,

Unknown Speaker  36:13
so soil

Speaker 1  36:15
this one. If you go into new orders and put that box, and that'll show the old owners too. Thanks, completed. Yeah, it's under mine too. It didn't generate and I'm thinking, if I put scalpy Hollow as completed for the deck boards, is that why it didn't show up with the Seattle did that, but the week it was doing and then when she moved it from this week to next week is that way through a lot,

Speaker 4  36:49
which cut move this one or this one cut move this week to next week. The top one, the Roman top is

Speaker 1  37:08
I see if the moment is finished, if I want to edit something and send it back to the cutlers, who cannot do that because something has already

Speaker 4  37:25
finished. Yeah, no, you'll stand up. Well, I'm saying thanks that you were talking about that last week. I don't remember all these details sometimes, until November gets job, drop, like, whatever. But yeah, I remember we talked about that last week.

Unknown Speaker  37:55
No,

Unknown Speaker  37:57
no. I mean, folks that be out, hey, there's a saw. I mean, yeah, John, still, you still think said it needs to be here. I making sure stuff gets down, doing his job. So, you know, I guess Tina wants him to go.

Speaker 1  38:42
I'm gonna be good for him, making the hell out of here for you know, I'm standing Yeah, and what's his name? Jeff, just off today and yesterday in the day. Give my itinerary. He's gonna schedule another mom, mother and jerry can have something can, let me say most today till everything's loaded for

Unknown Speaker  39:03
a Thursday. And Jerry can handle,

Speaker 1  39:06
essentially. Levi can handle, right, and then get cutless and aid and when I might have seen ones,

Matthias Miller  39:16
alright? So Ken, George, they can walk you three

Speaker 4  39:20
hours in the morning. Call your cell phone right if you have to.

Matthias Miller  39:25
Yeah. Matt, okay, so flag and Cutlass generator is just a way to say we needed a way for you to clean up to flag which which ones are missing sizes, and for you to clean, clean those up. So we can, we can talk about that more in a minute. No assembly required, just means

Unknown Speaker  39:46
it's a lumber item.

Matthias Miller  39:47
It's a lumber item or things that need to be well, let's see where we're using it. I.

Matthias Miller  40:02
Now this is not right anymore, because this is going to go away. This this will be be replaced. I'm pretty sure I'll confirm with I'm

Matthias Miller  40:34
pretty sure this is going to go

Unknown Speaker  40:40
away, then that box would go away, yep.

Matthias Miller  40:45
And then the we're going to have the so the stock item just means that when we assemble it, we assemble it before we sell it. So this could be repairs. We'll do repairs ahead of time and then sell the repairs. We'll on the waves. We'll build them and then figure out how much they need sell those off. That just means that we stock the assembled items. And this is all in the assembly section, so it's all assembly tracker related. We're also going to

Speaker 3  41:17
so that doesn't really originate to me, no, alright. And then, like I did when I when I clean up, like when I edit something in, like the ACI four, can I, then I check that, once I'm completed with that, check that box and get it out of there, yes. And then it will go, it won't be ill anymore,

Matthias Miller  41:40
correct? Yeah. But the reason all these are flagged is because we have, well, and if there's an easy way to see which ones of these, I mean, yeah, I don't know if there's an easy way to remove the flag. If there's a bunch of items that are flagged that shouldn't be. And there's an easy way to find them. I can take the flags off, you know, in one fell swoop, if we can identify those. Otherwise, we can just do them one at a time as they show up.

Speaker 3  42:13
Yeah, I was just doing them when the order comes up to, you know, me and trying to go in, but I didn't take Well, I didn't go once I edited them, I didn't go in and check that on check that flag box, yeah, so it'll probably show up yellow again the next,

Unknown Speaker  42:30
yep.

Speaker 3  42:33
Eventually that, man, there's not like you know me, and there's not a lot of them that I have to go in. It's mainly just taking stuff out of sizer prep and putting it into the sewing prep other

Matthias Miller  42:47
well that should be taken there's not that should be taken care of. So the most of the flags are. Most of the flags unnecessary, because the flags, I thought we were running into scenarios where where something needed the sizer, but it didn't have one specified.

Speaker 3  43:02
I might have hit one so far in that case, but mostly everything was, you'll mean a sewing like the sewing shop,

Matthias Miller  43:17
right? Like this one, this one, this one doesn't need a sizer. This one doesn't need a sizer,

Unknown Speaker  43:23
correct? Those are cutbacks, right? Okay.

Matthias Miller  43:31
I mean, if you want to, if this has served its purpose, I can clear all the flags.

Speaker 3  43:41
Nah. I leave them there, okay, and that way I can just once I added them, or once I swapped the you already did that, yeah,

Matthias Miller  43:52
all the stuff is swapped.

Matthias Miller  43:59
There's no more swapping.

Unknown Speaker  44:02
So there should be hardly anything in yellow.

Matthias Miller  44:05
Well, no, I mean the flag. That's what I'm saying. We moved everything across, so the flag doesn't mean anything. I think what we're saying is, you were there. We had some concern early on of, why? Why is size or not filled on on that one item? Um, let me try something else.

Speaker 2  44:28
The flag was a notation that there was no sizer chosen,

Matthias Miller  44:33
correct, nice, but some of that was intentional, and so that's why we made the flag, so that we could turn it off. Um,

Speaker 2  44:40
so you know how to turn off the flag,

Unknown Speaker  44:48
lower the flags.

Matthias Miller  44:52
But like I said, if it's, I mean, I'm I don't mind if you do it one by one, but if it served its purpose, and there was just, it was just because of that one thing that. It up. Well, then let's, let's just lower the flag everywhere. But yes, if you're good doing it one at a time, we can do it one

Speaker 3  45:09
at a time. I would say, do it one at a time. Justin, Justin kit. Knock on wood. You mean, there is something with the sizer. It has to be. I'd rather have that, you know, man, like I said, it's not 50 million I gotta do. I'm doing it order by order a day at a time. So it's not like there's 50 million there to have to do. Spend a lot of time

Matthias Miller  45:30
on exactly

Unknown Speaker  45:33
I'd rather be safe than sorry.

Matthias Miller  45:35
I like it.

Speaker 3  45:36
Okay? I have three different items here. I have two items that were completely missing off the Cutlass generator. Okay, it was so. 80322 the so number,

Matthias Miller  45:52
okay, let me go into here. Sorry. Eight zero, what was it

Unknown Speaker  46:01
again? 803 80322, I,

Unknown Speaker  46:46
or something.

Matthias Miller  46:49
So here's this guy, alright. I mean,

Unknown Speaker  46:52
that's saying, that's saying 54 hollow gene.

Matthias Miller  46:58
So the sizer, yeah, completed on the 19th

Matthias Miller  47:10
here, unscheduled and sawing. It

Speaker 3  47:17
was a 63 inch Stringer, inch and a 16 three and F, 63

Matthias Miller  47:23
Oh, hang on, 80322, I get what you're saying. CW

Unknown Speaker  47:32
three, I think.

Matthias Miller  47:34
CW three. Okay, yeah, there that one looks okay. So let's see what this one CW three.

Matthias Miller  47:56
Okay, here's a CW three on the sizer also completed on the 19th is that the rate? Yeah,

Speaker 3  48:10
but I never went to the cut list. That's what like the 54 like everything was group 54 the 100 inch and the 63 is all burned in a group on the cut list, 50 fours, and the hundreds were there, but the 63 is never, never went.

Speaker 3  48:33
And then I went into like the the completed, and I couldn't find it in the completed file either.

Matthias Miller  48:47
So it was marked as scheduled, Wednesday, at 730 it was marked as scheduled and then marked as completed at the same time.

Matthias Miller  49:05
So it it looks like it never got marked as scheduled on the 19th, which is which from thinking, right? That's why it would wouldn't have shown up on the on the printout, right? Um,

Speaker 3  49:21
because I had a second one that was yesterday morning, and then yesterday afternoon, I had a new home on job that was 80321,

Matthias Miller  49:39
were there? Did any of them show up?

Speaker 3  49:46
Yeah, I had everything but the the inch and 13, five and amp 130, fours, I think it's an FN 374, I. Uh,

Matthias Miller  50:22
let's go back here.

Unknown Speaker  50:28
It was due for 827,

Matthias Miller  50:32
827, Okay, which one of these items would have been

Unknown Speaker  50:35
it's that one right there, the one you were just setting on. 374, up one right there.

Matthias Miller  50:42
Then he sent you. Okay, so let's go find this guy.

Matthias Miller  50:51
You want, the 819, one, this guy

Matthias Miller  50:58
here, it was added to the schedule on 1250

Matthias Miller  51:14
and you printed it out, schedule out later that afternoon, right,

Unknown Speaker  51:18
right. I but it wasn't on,

Speaker 3  51:26
just like the 60 threes. It wasn't on the schedule.

Matthias Miller  51:32
Let me do this. I'm going to mark this one. Okay, and this one is on the brewer. I'm going to take this mark this incomplete for a minute, and I'm going to go back over into the schedule.

Matthias Miller  52:01
Name, that one shows up. Then if I take it off the schedule, put this back in, because obviously it was done. I don't know what to tell you on this one. I

Matthias Miller  52:26
If you can we just do this. If you run into

Matthias Miller  52:36
run into this again, can you just text it? Can you? Can you text me with the with the information, and let's see if we can catch it when it's happening and see what's going on.

Speaker 3  52:52
Yeah. Yeah, like I said, it seemed odd because it was one yesterday morning, that one with the 63 inch, and then it was one this yesterday afternoon, with the 134 and like I said, 63 that was in with the 50 fours and the hundreds. That's all Conestoga Wood, and that's where it should have been placed. But like I said, it wasn't,

Unknown Speaker  53:18
it wasn't there.

Matthias Miller  53:22
So I mean, the one, the one yesterday morning, was it somehow never got, it got onto the schedule. And so that's why I never printed. But with the one yesterday, I mean, the this New Holland one, I don't, I don't know I and that's why I'm inclined to say, if we can catch it while it's happening, it would make it a lot easier for me to I guess we could hang on. We have, I don't know how much work it's worth going to so you wouldn't have marked it complete until this morning. I should be able to go to last night, pull it back up from last night. Stroke backups, 826,

Speaker 3  54:22
well, that's when I found out that we didn't have it. It was a couple pages back.

Matthias Miller  54:29
So when would you have let's go see when you when you schedule it so you you added it to

Matthias Miller  54:44
you put it in on the 19th. So the evening of the 19th, I don't know if I have that, because after Hey, look at that, it would be. The 20th at 1am we do because after, after a while, we stop keeping daily backups, and we go to weeklies. But I think it might have it here for the 20th, and so we should be able to, I

Matthias Miller  55:26
all right, it's almost done, almost done downloading, and I'll need about five minutes to get it up and running on my system.

Matthias Miller  55:41
Time Travel, man, going up, going back, at least you can't do the future, but sometimes we can go back in the past.

Unknown Speaker  55:58
All right, so 820,

Matthias Miller  56:22
I take it for this thing down.

Unknown Speaker  56:46
A copy.

Speaker 3  56:51
And the thing I gotta watch when we have the same colors hooked together, and I'm not sure if that might have been like if I did one one of them and the other one was tagged to it. That's what I'm thinking. But I'm not 100% sure.

Unknown Speaker  57:10
I don't know,

Speaker 3  57:13
because I've been really watching that, because I got myself caught in that a couple times, And

Matthias Miller  57:46
so now we have okay. So now let's uh

Matthias Miller  58:05
to let's see hang on Way easier.

Unknown Speaker  58:28
Okay, stop

Unknown Speaker  58:38
it. That's it. Do not I.

Matthias Miller  59:46
All right, so we going to the sizer cut list, do the brewer, and we are looking for, uh.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:03
Sky. Um, is

Matthias Miller  1:00:11
this where you Is this what you'd be expecting to see?

Speaker 3  1:00:16
Yeah, but it's engine, 13, five and a half, 134, I mean, there's multiple things for others, multiple things right for that, for because we go down five more cells, there's another one that goes along with that job.

Matthias Miller  1:00:32
Okay, so if we go back to the let's go back to here. So we have

Matthias Miller  1:00:44
okay, but these two are not flagged as the engine 1316, isn't flagged as being scheduled. All right, as as of so if we go, let's go back into here. Then, uh,

Matthias Miller  1:01:08
okay, is this the 13 six? Is this the right one? Yeah, right there, yep. Okay, so if you go back into activity history again, on this one,

Matthias Miller  1:01:21
it it got marked as scheduled. Wait. This was created on the seventh. Wait a minute. This got marked as completed on the 11th. Let me go back to do I have the right one? Then it's created in the 19th. Not sure I here? Hang on. Hang on. It's 928,

Matthias Miller  1:02:16
hang on. Let's do this. Let me just straight up look at pull up the scoreboard. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:02:36
I mean, here's another one that get marked as scheduled until the next the next morning.

Matthias Miller  1:02:48
So I would just mean first thing to check if something's not showing up in the schedule is to make sure that that the schedule checkbox for sure got checked. I'm

Matthias Miller  1:03:28
haha, maybe that makes sense, or is there something, something nice?

Speaker 3  1:03:34
Yeah, I just keep an eye on if it I mean, if it happens, then I'll text you and yes, get you caught up. Yep. Now I had one other one before I let you go. Tina had we had an order in for Remy CV, which is kind of our Cockeysville, Maryland. She moved it from this week to next week nine two. Now, if you go into the sage like the new orders and take that box or click that box off. Yep, hit continue. And then you go to nine two and look for that Remy

Matthias Miller  1:04:12
like nine to

Speaker 3  1:04:15
think it's a Remy CV, y, PCV, I, uh,

Speaker 3  1:04:25
there you go. This guy. Now it it went to, she moved it to nine two, but it never went to my schedule. Now my question is, Scapy, hollow cuts them deck boards. So if I did scalpy cut list and marked that complete when she in the week it was supposed to be due, and then she moved it from then to nine two, is that why the stringers didn't show up in the cut list generator? So.

Speaker 3  1:05:02
Know, let's go take a look, cuz I can see that she had moved it to nine two, which on checking that box. But I'm not I wasn't sure if I know I marked complete on the scalpy on the deck boards, and I didn't know if that once she that was beforehand, when it was actually do, but then she moved it from that week to nine two, which I didn't know if that's why the runners didn't show up, because I had to handwrite them on the cut list. I

Matthias Miller  1:05:51
um, I mean, we get one set to scalpy, one to Brewer. But no sawing. Is that what you would expect,

Speaker 3  1:06:06
right? But seeing that, that original date, that when this CV started, I would have made the scalpy list and then marked that complete with the deck boards, but the stringers would have been still open. So when I marked the deck boards being complete, a scalpy, but then she moved the date from this this week and next week or nine two, but it showed it moved it to nine two, but it wasn't showing up on the like either a new order. And I'm wondering if it's because I mark scalpy as the board's being complete.

Matthias Miller  1:06:48
So on the so on the scalpy. 905 we created it, scheduled it at 932 and then completed it on 932 on the brewer, created it at 905 changed a few stuff, moved it to Keystone, scheduled it At 926 added miscellaneous prep, completed it on 815

Speaker 3  1:07:23
so that Miller probably scribbled it off the cut list because we didn't need it

Speaker 1  1:07:29
when she said about moving the date. So that's what happened there. That's, I mean, if it

Speaker 3  1:07:35
when she moved it to nine two, it didn't show up again, because of everything was completed.

Matthias Miller  1:07:42
So what you should probably have done is marked it as you know, unscheduled. And it's kind of obnoxious to leave it hanging around, but just let it hang around for a week.

Speaker 3  1:07:53
All right. So how, like when you say, on schedule? What? How do I do?

Matthias Miller  1:08:00
Like on the I mean, just like, uncheck, uncheck this box here, all right, then take it off the schedule, all right. Or if you want to, I mean, if you want to mark it complete, it's not really complete, but you could search for it, for completed items. Go back and find find it. Sorry, that's the wrong list this guy. Go back and find it and then clear the completed date and clear the schedule, date the schedule, or just clear the completed date to bring it back on the schedule and move it back over. Yeah, that'll bring it back on. If you clear the completed data, put it back on the on your schedule,

Speaker 3  1:08:47
alright? And that like the completed stuff that's not, like cloudy, like the like, the new orders list, like,

Matthias Miller  1:08:58
No, you go in, no, it's not. But you go in and you say, include completed items, and it just shows the full list of, alright, every last thing. All

Speaker 3  1:09:07
right, so as long as I take the date out, then I can move it back across. Yeah, alright. Sounds good,

Unknown Speaker  1:09:16
good. I think we're good.

Speaker 3  1:09:20
All right, I have to get a MERV one too. He ran off.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:29
Merv dollar. Come on. Yes,

Unknown Speaker  1:09:37
sir, I'm gone. Oh,

Speaker 2  1:09:41
Hi, Scott, Hey, sir, yeah, Matt, is there any I mean, I think,

Matthias Miller  1:09:46
Doc, I'm good. I'll get my stuff cranked out. I'll get it back over to John. T keep working on cleanup and and I think, sorry, yeah, go ahead.

Speaker 2  1:09:56
Well, John said on entries, he's been using the. A SPC repair category. He's been using the sample crate in the sample pallet categories that are in there now, right?

Matthias Miller  1:10:11
Think so, yeah, they just, they're just flagged for him right now, and we just need to, well, they're flagged and being treated as assembly time, which we need to change, but

Speaker 2  1:10:22
yes, so that'll will some of that will that go away?

Matthias Miller  1:10:26
Yes? Well, some of that will get Yes, is the short answer.

Speaker 2  1:10:33
So I'll tell him. It's basically my response to him is saying that the What am I telling him about the flag? Thanks, George.

Matthias Miller  1:10:46
Tell him. Tell him that you and I mean, I think it could be as simple as you and I talked. I'm making some changes, and I'll be in touch with him to go over that stuff

Unknown Speaker  1:11:01
with him. Perfect.

Matthias Miller  1:11:05
Yeah, cool, man,

Unknown Speaker  1:11:10
wow. Um, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:11:15
yeah. How you doing personally?

Matthias Miller  1:11:18
Uh, there's a lot of good there's a lot of, I don't know, the whole one of my one of my mentors, said that everywhere he turns the economy has the same feel as covid does, just sloppy, sloshing around, Whiplash, just really weird stuff happening, and so I felt that it's been a little tricky to navigate, overall, overall, I feel like I'm doing Well, yeah,

Speaker 2  1:12:00
I appreciate you from my side a lot. Like, yeah, I've enjoyed, I've enjoyed this process,

Matthias Miller  1:12:08
good. Like,

Speaker 2  1:12:11
maybe a little too much, I don't know. I don't think so. I don't think so. Like, no, it's not too much, because I've enjoyed. I'm like, Huh? Because I don't always know what I what I if I could do whatever I want to do with no limitations, what would I actually, actually do? Like, I'm not sure. Like, you know, if it's in the name of Jesus and helping others, but it's still, there's no limitations.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:39
I'm not comfortable. I'm 100%

Speaker 2  1:12:42
sure, but, but, like I enjoy, I don't know. I have a bent for like, things being in order. Can be called a perfectionist sometimes. Is that okay?

Matthias Miller  1:12:57
Well, I mean, let's people call things by all kinds of different things, right? I think, yeah, so is it okay? I mean, I don't think you can control what people call you, right? I think the question is, can you do this? This was, this is a really helpful insight from spiritual director. I was asking him about perfection, and he said, high standards are okay as long as there's agreement on them. There are people who go work for Elon Musk, and they know when they sign on, they're going to be working 18 to 20 hour days, and they're like, they're like, that's just, it's going to be intense, but boy, like, you're going to make good money, you're going to have interesting problems to solve. You'll be working with really smart people like, and so that, to me, has really helped. Of like, I don't have to, I feel like it's wrong to take somebody and say, Do you Do you agree to work this easy, posh job? And they say, yes, then you're like, Oh, I can't stand that. Like you got to turn up the heat. Well, you have to renegotiate that. We need something else. Are you? Are you willing to put in? We need more out of whoever's in this role we'd love to have you. Can you offer this? Yes or No. If they can, then you have to be willing to say, Well, I gotta go find somebody who's willing. Somebody who's willing to put that in that, to me, is the key dividing line between high standards and how you navigate that.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:31
Sure, there's

Matthias Miller  1:14:32
nothing inherently wrong.

Speaker 2  1:14:34
Yeah, yeah. I think too. Then as a leader, like, how do you project, how do you project your wishes? You know? How do you whatever, yeah, yeah, it matters how it's projected. I know that,

Matthias Miller  1:14:53
yeah, it it does, and I don't feel like I'm really good at that. I also think that. There's some people who are just, you can also just become way more selective about the types of, I don't know. You can't always, you don't always have that luxury. No, you do have this luxury. You can choose the people you work with most directly. And there are people who are willing to work with just plotters and the average people, like, I mean average people, by definition, are average. It's that's You can't run away from that. It's fine, but you can choose to surround yourself with people who, who are your type of people, and then let them be the translators to the rest

Unknown Speaker  1:15:35
of the world.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:37
Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:15:40
yeah. Take this. No, are you still on with that?

Unknown Speaker  1:15:45
Yes.

Speaker 5  1:15:49
John Keith, that Jerry just came in the South for diesel for 828, 25 none of

Unknown Speaker  1:15:57

Stafford do diesel, 828, 25/5

Unknown Speaker  1:16:14
time. Look at that. Matt,

Matthias Miller  1:16:15

Shoot me. It says it was completed. The One size was completed on 821, I,

Matthias Miller  1:16:53
I don't know exactly which does he have an order Number, or anything

Speaker 2  1:17:01
you have, is there an order number? It was 828, Matt, this guy, style for diesel,

Unknown Speaker  1:17:13
80346, okay,

Speaker 2  1:17:17
Yeah, that's it. Matt, that's it. 10, four. For I'm I think
