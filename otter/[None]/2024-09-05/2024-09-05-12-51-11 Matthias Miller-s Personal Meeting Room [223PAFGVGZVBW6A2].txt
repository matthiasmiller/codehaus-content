Speaker 1  04:01
Okay, Do in

Unknown Speaker  04:07
Kansas, you would be, that would be a stem, Very what a stem? You know, I'm like, Hey,

Matthias Miller  04:23
right, it's the modern plastic. Let's give ourselves cancer version of it.

Speaker 2  04:27
Yeah, yeah. That was the response on the on your My story that, not saying she didn't have any points, but the when I came to the Kansas Well, that's your story. It's like,

Matthias Miller  04:46
I found it interesting and very telling that Samuel came back and he went to bat for me. It's like the classic Perry. I don't know if you've heard the Perry story, when he has his spiritual, optional, spiritual pop, and this guy stands up and is like, why? Are we getting this out at a marketing conference? And he shuts up, and then somebody's like, this was optional, by the way, like you stand right? I kind of feel like Samuel did exactly that for me. I mean, he had some really good feedback. I think they sent you those questions back to you.

Unknown Speaker  05:18
I read for him,

Matthias Miller  05:21
so Anyway, okay, so here, let me, let me. Let me drop this in this chat. Let's get nuance, man, nuance.

Speaker 2  05:40
Oh, okay, well, if, if she's connected with you, great.

Speaker 2  05:54
Okay, clearly, clearly, I'm on the negative column. Just, Oh,

Matthias Miller  05:58
it's fine. I'm not opposing. So, so this is the kind of discussion where we went from just disagreeing, and I think once you get new ones. So it's possible I'm looking for silver bullet, and it's possible that I doubt the strength of the messaging that we already had.

Speaker 2  06:15
Well, I'm I'm okay with you moving with someone good person, but to me, to me, if you've created something just, just reach out, you know, like Talk to talk to try and talk to someone. Um, um, because I don't want you to build something out for, you know, another, another period of time, right when you could, when you could, just, even if it's imperfect, and even if it gets imperfect results, I value talking to someone from corporate like Dan Sullivan is very clear about the only person's vote that matters is the person who writes the check. Yep, and maybe, maybe it's in a state where you need help until someone writes the check, but until you've tried it on your own, I wouldn't, I don't know.

Matthias Miller  07:25
Well, I mean, dove says something similar about it's always wise to give it one go.

Unknown Speaker  07:35
I didn't hear that,

Matthias Miller  07:37
that it's always wise to give it one go on your own.

Unknown Speaker  07:39
Oh, yeah.

Matthias Miller  07:43
So I mean, what is it that I'm wanting out of it?

Speaker 2  07:49
Okay, I think I need to excuse myself from this conversation. What's that? Well, one is it's, I don't. I think this is a you decision and I don't like I'm, I'm a vested competitor, so I'm trying to get paid on previous money. So I think I'm, I'm not someone who should be talking about, like if you're exploring options, I have a vested interest in not you not exploring options. Let's just put it that way. Okay,

Speaker 3  08:34
I think that's fair. So, so, so, but

Speaker 2  08:38
I'm open with exploring anyone else but her, but with her, I'm like, this feels. I maybe, maybe there's some value. I think I'm overly skewing things, and maybe there's some emotions there. But I just don't, I just don't see from her, from her content, maybe for the person is wonderful, yeah. I, this is what I this is what Marcus recommends. Rewrite the my life story for our corporate audience. Okay? Like focus more on the corporate journey side of things, because that's who they are, right?

Speaker 2  09:39
If you could tell all your story elements from I'm just wondering if it's possible, if you could tie all the story elements to the corporate maybe, maybe, maybe it's fine as it is, because maybe they're transitioning themselves out of corporate like I'm not sure. Sure, but at least maybe, maybe on the front cover, you could, at the top, you could, you could tie it to,

Unknown Speaker  10:08
you know,

Unknown Speaker  10:11
transition something, something related to corporate like dove. Dove calls his clients corporate refugees. I don't know if, if that's if that's your audience, but there needs to be some call out to your audience at the least.

Matthias Miller  10:57
Well, the natural thing would be to go find the tribe of people who want to do exactly what I'm doing and have an identical story. And

Speaker 2  11:16
the the national thing is that you are your client's story, right? So I don't necessarily think you need to mess with the story right now, but I do think you should call your audience out. I I

Matthias Miller  11:45
mean, there's parts of it in which, if you just remove the fact that some of it is my own business, or don't overly compensate or overly talk to

Speaker 2  11:58
the small business entrepreneurs, then it, then you could map it onto corporate, right, a big client.

Matthias Miller  12:07
I mean, they could assume, rightly or wrongly, that I did this all under the corporate umbrella.

Speaker 2  12:16
I mean, to me, business is business, whether you're in corporate or not, that's that's fine.

Matthias Miller  12:24
So you're suggesting, do you think we need to read it and see where it misses the bottom?

Speaker 2  12:32
Well, when I hear corporate, I hear, I don't know if you're talking to the owners of companies, right? I think you're talking to their second in commands. I

Matthias Miller  12:46
think, okay, there's been a very interesting pattern that I think is, unless I get smacked upside the head and tell me I have to work with somebody different, I think I am supposed to work with second. I like the people who been coming out of the woodwork? I have half a dozen now presents two ICS like it's the two ICS that are getting their teeth kicked in and thrown to the bus and run through the ringer, thrown under the bus, run through the ringer for whatever reason,

Unknown Speaker  13:17
right? ICS means

Unknown Speaker  13:21
that second in command, okay,

Speaker 2  13:23
is there? Is there a way to call that out at the top, a story, a story for second in commands or a anyways, we don't need to do that now. But I think that's, if you can make it about I think that's that's your angle, winning

Matthias Miller  13:51
by being second. I don't know that that's completely right. Winning

Unknown Speaker  13:56
as a second in command. The

Matthias Miller  14:01
main thing we have to make sure is that that's not trademarked or anything.

Matthias Miller  14:10
Trademark surge, I know what's his name. Uses this very heavily. What's this? The Cameron Herald,

Unknown Speaker  14:19
you could say being being in second place,

Matthias Miller  14:27
second. Okay, so there's a few, there's, there's a few books how to be second, second in command, but second in command, at least the power of your coo. There's actually a Christian book by Dutch sheets. Second command, strength of leaders, who serve leaders.

Unknown Speaker  14:54
Yeah, that's i.

Unknown Speaker  15:00
So, so this is, this is who to summarize some of doves writing you either sniper, direct message your audience, if you, if your audience is RC, CEOs and you can't get in front of them, then you message someone who's adjacent to them, which would be, you know, second in second in command.

Speaker 1  15:35
What? What advice? Go ahead. Keep going. Keep going, um

Speaker 2  15:40
or and, or market to there's a third option, but I think if you, if you're targeting CEOs, it's going to be hard. If you it would be easy on LinkedIn to do direct message to a second in command. I This seems to fit.

Matthias Miller  16:09
Jack reamer had a post recently about responsive rate. Response rates by see if I can find it by title. Yeah, by title. I

Unknown Speaker  16:25
The hardest job title to get a

Unknown Speaker  16:28
cold email reply from.

Matthias Miller  16:32
So sales was by far easiest. Marketing and executive were nearly tied HR and operations is actually the second that's most difficult,

Unknown Speaker  16:48
but

Matthias Miller  16:51
untested assumption. I think there's a bleeding neck here.

Unknown Speaker  17:00
Yeah.

Speaker 2  17:13
Hey, and you know what to me, how many people want to spend time listening to a second in command. Like I wonder how many people in their lives actually get

Unknown Speaker  17:28
they get to talk to?

Matthias Miller  17:35
Well, I've been surprised how many times I am just a straight up therapist for these guys.

Speaker 2  17:43
That's, that's my uncle's angle that I really, I think is a great in

Speaker 2  17:53
it's, it's, it's, you know, knowing they're visiting, knowing they have position of power. Everyone else wants something out of them. You're coming alongside to just for what they need. Like, yeah.

Matthias Miller  18:22
So, okay, so let's say that I

Unknown Speaker  18:44
Nathan, young David.

Unknown Speaker  18:58
Hey Nathan, one of my clients recently mentioned program you have impactful That is intrigued now so

Matthias Miller  19:31
Okay, so let's do I'm

Unknown Speaker  19:54
David do.

Matthias Miller  20:52
Um Here, let me send one more. Hi, David plans of mine, mentioned

Unknown Speaker  20:59
before and I just noticed your

Unknown Speaker  21:06
latest post.

Speaker 2  21:09
Well before you do that, I feel like I did. Feel like you need to change my story cover. I don't know if he clicks over your website. He's like Oh, this for the same type of people, does he know you?

Unknown Speaker  21:29
There was a parent connection requested.

Unknown Speaker  21:37
All Right, so I

Unknown Speaker  21:57
Do you think I

Matthias Miller  22:39
winning in second place. It's not a Good subtitle, tool, tagline, Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  23:35
um, oh, really,

Speaker 2  23:45
I don't know you can. Know you can say, well, well, this is how, this is how. I mean, I say you can't. Chris did it, but it was more like four. It's not two taglines, maybe, or it's four or from right?

Matthias Miller  24:14
But that's not a tagline. That's the

Speaker 2  24:16
take for those, for those who want to win in second place for the for the for the

Unknown Speaker  24:26
it's not as tight, and is it CEOs.

Matthias Miller  24:35
I mean, I'm Do people understand what second place means here?

Unknown Speaker  24:47
No, I think you need to say from the second from the corporate trenches,

Unknown Speaker  24:58
from, from. Can

Matthias Miller  25:00
it just be as simple as how to win as the second in command, or am I? Am I robbing too much from Cameron Harold's over the branding should be backing on that,

Unknown Speaker  25:16
but it's not.

Speaker 1  25:22
But I feel like very easily, it sounds like a tactical but

Unknown Speaker  25:35
I think, I mean, it's your story, though, so it's different.

Matthias Miller  25:42
You could also combine the two undiluted clarity, connection and courage, cover the second in command. So

Unknown Speaker  26:09
or

Speaker 2  26:13
how to win undiluted clarity. Blah, for the second in command.

Matthias Miller  26:24
Let's first do from losing myself to finding myself as the second in command. I

Unknown Speaker  26:47
or even

Matthias Miller  26:49
discovering my undiluted discovering My undiluted self as a second I

Unknown Speaker  27:23
uh, why not? Why not have it like this? Because I

Matthias Miller  27:34
I'll try a trump card, because my brand is about simple, and I don't know which one to read. It would be different if it's if, like, okay, the argument said, the other one is biographical in nature, from the fill in the blank.

Unknown Speaker  27:54
Well, then, is there a way of combining to the

Matthias Miller  28:01
that's fair. I mean, it's the journey of a second in command. The a second in Command's journey from blank to undiluted clarity, connection, courage. I

Speaker 2  28:24
return the journey of a second in command. And why not just that?

Matthias Miller  28:35
Yeah, then I don't know if the fonts are right, but Yeah, conceptually, I'm happy with that. How Do I do

Unknown Speaker  29:08
maybe light and then some

Unknown Speaker  29:33
I'm happy with that.

Speaker 2  29:35
I think, I think you need to start with, it's better to start with second in command than having at the end. Yeah, I think you're right.

Unknown Speaker  29:54
What if? Oh.

Speaker 2  30:00
This. Probably this might not look as good, but what if? What if this was the main thing, and then my 100 proof store was here,

Unknown Speaker  30:12
we try it. Okay,

Matthias Miller  30:17
okay, but the title shift is not

Unknown Speaker  30:20
the journey of

Matthias Miller  30:31
Okay, how about this second place, or second in command? With my 100 proof story of undiluted i

Unknown Speaker  30:51
Is it, too? Is it? I?

Unknown Speaker  31:10
My 100 dream story

Matthias Miller  31:22
of I mean, I would say my own true story of finding

Unknown Speaker  31:27
undiluted.

Unknown Speaker  31:34
Oh, one second I fancy keyboard. I

Speaker 2  31:46
I can go to a different key level, where all the characters are numbers. I'm still fine. I'm still figuring it out, okay, of finding

Matthias Miller  32:02
undiluted clarity connection page, okay, and I would do this as, what if you did second place or second command no question marks, and put awareness its own line, not caps.

Unknown Speaker  32:22
Oh, I know I got an idea

Unknown Speaker  32:32
I can execute. I

Unknown Speaker  32:54
Is it capital? I

Speaker 1  33:07
dude, or, or, or lowercase, so.

Matthias Miller  33:32
I hope second in command, second and commands not be second place. I

Matthias Miller  33:44
maybe it's missing color now, but,

Unknown Speaker  33:47
yeah, I'm not sure what to do about the color. But,

Matthias Miller  33:52
I mean, you could just do my the 100 proof. Again, that's the No. I mean, put the 100 proof in red,

Unknown Speaker  34:00
pulls the eyes. What if this was read? Because it's like, that's the

Matthias Miller  34:15
the title generally needs to go up. It's not in thirds. Somehow. I'm not sure what word exactly, but yeah, a little bit more maybe i

Matthias Miller  34:43
Okay, what if you did this? Can you create one more copy,

Matthias Miller  34:53
kill the order and put it after second place in white and put them like. Next to each other. No same font. Just delete it.

Unknown Speaker  35:14
Lowercase.

Unknown Speaker  35:21
Like do you want me to just from here?

Unknown Speaker  35:23
Yeah, just from there, yep. Now, make that we're white.

Unknown Speaker  35:40
Boom, boom.

Speaker 2  35:48
I'm not, not sure if I totally agree tracking with the This makes, this makes like visually, it's simpler to me, but I

Unknown Speaker  36:03
Okay, I don't like the weird broken up.

Speaker 2  36:08
Wait. What if? Okay, what if, ah versus, versus

Matthias Miller  36:17
second place versus, but then there should be a question. I

Unknown Speaker  36:24
You decide

Unknown Speaker  36:27
up top that'll be the same.

Unknown Speaker  36:32
You choose, your choice. You

Matthias Miller  36:42
it's the visual, the visual, the visual. There's too many visual elements. The verses in the sword are breaking everything up.

Unknown Speaker  36:59
Well, maybe

Unknown Speaker  37:08
maybe you don't need 100 proof.

Unknown Speaker  37:16
My story of finding on my story, or just

Unknown Speaker  37:25
like, if I really simplified it, where's the center? I

Matthias Miller  37:35
still think the v should be liverpost. You wouldn't normally capitalize the beat.

Unknown Speaker  37:40
Oh, really. Okay,

Speaker 3  37:44
second place versus second I still think it shouldn't be smacked out in a little spring. The rule of thirds. You think, where what

Matthias Miller  37:56
it's bringing the rule of thirds? I think it should go up the title. Well, I need.

Unknown Speaker  38:14
I I wonder

Unknown Speaker  38:49
where we

Speaker 2  39:00
won't let me paste it. I have, I have, I have, basically the grid. I

Speaker 2  39:12
don't know why I try to move it over, but I have, I Have the golden grid. Why am I not saying

Unknown Speaker  39:31
okay?

Unknown Speaker  39:51
I need it to scale, and I not get it to scale. Oh, maybe I, I.

Matthias Miller  40:00
Yeah, I don't want to ask you, perfect.

Unknown Speaker  40:08
Okay, well, as if you're I could do that later. I

Speaker 2  40:45
underproof I don't know if underproofs My story of finding my corporate story. I

Speaker 3  41:15
and alluded clarity, connection, courage in the face of

Unknown Speaker  41:22
cubicles.

Unknown Speaker  41:35
The title doesn't do

Matthias Miller  41:38
you think the title, I mean, the title obviously speak very specifically to these people.

Unknown Speaker  41:46
I'm sorry, what about the title?

Speaker 3  41:48
It definitely speaks about these people,

Unknown Speaker  41:52
right? But

Matthias Miller  41:53
it does not seem to me to be proof is, yeah, catchy,

Speaker 2  42:01
well, I don't know If we can make it visually catchy like This. I

Unknown Speaker  42:37
What? Why? Why not flip this my little empathy story,

Speaker 3  42:50
and the subtitle is just the battle between second place and second in command.

Unknown Speaker  42:54
Oh, okay. Well,

Speaker 2  43:17
the battle, I like, the battle between the

Speaker 1  43:25
and being second second place and being second in

Matthias Miller  43:50
a battle between being second place and being second in demand, taking

Speaker 1  43:59
taking the second place. I taking second place.

Unknown Speaker  44:09
This is actually good because it fits in with your competitive

Unknown Speaker  44:13
it is,

Unknown Speaker  44:16
by the way, a lot of people say, I don't know if it's red trash.

Speaker 1  44:20
I like to be second I'm like, Well, I don't know that's nuanced question,

Unknown Speaker  44:29
but I feel like,

Unknown Speaker  44:30
look at that. Look at that.

Speaker 2  44:35
And it's got battle he threw battle in, and it's not an infringing on second place dude,

Matthias Miller  44:46
and it's it, but it so it has the hook. It calls you out. And I'm like, I read that. And I'm like, I'm not there anymore. But I think, I think a lot of people feel. Up.

Speaker 1  45:02
Yes, look at that. Here. I love it.

Speaker 2  45:15
I think, I mean, maybe not here, but I do like this. I do like something about this, because this feels like you're you're losing,

Matthias Miller  45:24
and this feels so I think, I think this is a, this is a slide, it's a post, it's a it's a diagram somewhere, but it's visually cover, yeah, the back cover. It could just be the choice is yours, back cover, the choice is yours, second place. Are you?

Speaker 2  45:45
Are you stuck in second place, or are you a second in command?

Unknown Speaker  45:50
I don't know. Whatever it is that

Unknown Speaker  45:56
has got punch.

Speaker 1  45:57
Are you okay? I back cover here.

Speaker 3  46:12
I'm gonna go see if I can find a minute spot to set up and I can stay connected

Unknown Speaker  46:21
with The background noise.

Matthias Miller  47:20
And then you can put the arrows on the outside of that.

Unknown Speaker  47:44
I need to figure out. I

Matthias Miller  47:49
put it on the right hand side, or maybe not. No, you're right.

Unknown Speaker  47:55
Maybe you could. What if you had I now maybe,

Unknown Speaker  48:15
or are you winning?

Unknown Speaker  48:17
Winning as a shoot,

Unknown Speaker  48:29
or winning

Unknown Speaker  48:36
as second.

Speaker 2  48:37
You don't need the A you could What if you had the verses in the Middle,

Matthias Miller  48:50
or a winning second in command.

Matthias Miller  49:02
We're just winning as second command,

Unknown Speaker  49:07
winning, as

Unknown Speaker  49:10
you need to say, a right.

Unknown Speaker  49:18
I don't know. Well,

Unknown Speaker  49:22
I think, I think,

Unknown Speaker  49:38
Well, anyways, this, this, keep my 100 proof story. Got the sword, got the battle, taking place. Second place taking is like, yeah, I.

Matthias Miller  50:00
Here, I need to drop off for just a minute and check in With my with Audra.

Unknown Speaker  50:06
I will hop back On. I

Matthias Miller  1:08:44
All right, I'm back. Thank you for that. Getting event space lined up. If you can hear me or not, you're muted and hiding you.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:18
There we go. Couldn't find you. There you go.

Matthias Miller  1:09:24
All right, so this is incredibly intriguing. Now, what's the here's one question I have.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:41
Yes, is this,

Matthias Miller  1:09:47
I think the answer is yes. If we go after coos, is this still something we can charge 25k a day for? I.

Matthias Miller  1:10:06
Or is there an equivalent price tag where we can pay charge 100k for one year PLO, 100 proof coaching package? It seems very unlikely that we couldn't, okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:10:26
first, first,

Unknown Speaker  1:10:36
go for it,

Unknown Speaker  1:10:36
I don't know first, first, you had to scale them out in a little you know, that's fair. I don't know. I think. I think 100x is great, the first 10x and then you can 100x

Speaker 1  1:10:57
right? It is TEDx. No, right,

Speaker 2  1:11:01
no, no, but go off of, go off of, what's 10x for you now, right?

Speaker 2  1:11:16
Like to me, the to me, the 10x is what the Perry offer is like 2500 right? So, 10x that 25

Unknown Speaker  1:11:29
Okay, great. So what are you saying? You just said? What he just said?

Speaker 2  1:11:38
Oh, you're saying a year long program, right, okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:11:44
no, yeah. I mean, I'm

Unknown Speaker  1:11:47
not, I'm not high one. I

Unknown Speaker  1:11:49
did attend a 25k program, and there was a lot to it, yeah, like, there was a lot to it. And the you, you were at, like,

Speaker 2  1:12:08
I mean, I just think, I just think, that's a, I mean, look, write yourself, put yourself down as 100k man. And that vision will be come to it. So, you know, map it, map it in your as a star.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:32
Well,

Matthias Miller  1:12:33
I mean, it can. There's a variety of ways to package it, I think, I think, but I also think, tell me if I'm wrong. I think we can ask our way into it. And I don't know exactly, okay,

Speaker 2  1:12:49
here's, I've got, I've got it. Okay, I've done, I've done, uh, full program on pricing. Okay, so, okay, you price, price the client, not the service. So I just, I just need to know what type of client you're going after. What have they paid for? Other things, if that's, if that's 100k you got 100k

Matthias Miller  1:13:21
I don't disagree. I don't disagree. And I think this could be a

Speaker 2  1:13:28
I just, I just want, I I just want 10k for now,

Unknown Speaker  1:13:35
I'm, I'm fine with that.

Speaker 2  1:13:39
For the first few you get 10k like, get your founders club going.

Matthias Miller  1:13:43
I don't care if it's 5k for the first 15, I don't you know whatever

Unknown Speaker  1:13:51
see here I am. I'm going to push you. And

Matthias Miller  1:13:54
you're not always going to know whether I'm saying, Hey, this is where, what I feel like God told me, and you don't know whether this is me just being my wonky me pushing until you ask, okay, it will have good, good arguments along the way. I don't know. I hope you're okay with that.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:11
That's fine. I mean, no, I think, I think,

Speaker 2  1:14:22
yeah, one one tip is take a take a three by five card, and draw a visual of of your pay, right, or the program, whatever you want to call it, so that even if it's not like an offer out there, it's just your personal, your personal trajectory that you look at every day. Yep, I

Unknown Speaker  1:14:54
think it's fair. Okay, so

Unknown Speaker  1:14:59
I. I think, go

Speaker 2  1:15:03
ahead. There's a there's a win without pitching workshop. Okay, that it targets, it targets creative firms, but it's a lot more dimensional like it. They're expanding it out the the thinking, that's just the positioning, but the thinking can go to anyone, and they they're the guys who, let me just show you

Unknown Speaker  1:15:36
I'm pulling up now.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:38
Well, they're the guys who pricing.

Matthias Miller  1:15:56
So it's a works, it's a workshop, yeah, Monday through Thursday, half a day, three hours a day, yeah.

Speaker 2  1:16:08
So what I like? Okay, so here's, here's what I did with them. Oh, they just changed their branding. They're figuring that out. I like the red branding. Oh, that's okay. Okay, this is where I got the pricing strategies for your landing page. And it's value based. It's like they actually do it, and they their clients, like, end up 3x on their price. And

Unknown Speaker  1:16:50
anyways,

Speaker 4  1:16:56
you should never be in the situation. Okay, they, they have it's in their note, we lesson by how to do this uncover.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:02
Well this far

Speaker 2  1:17:05
anyway, look, I don't, I don't know what I'm doing right now. I just, I just really respect them. They have a they have a workshop.

Matthias Miller  1:17:17
Here's what you're not so subtly saying. You're saying, I am a pricing expert, and you should listen to me on pricing, and I will help you figure out pricing networks.

Speaker 2  1:17:26
No, I'm saying I've done what I know for the pricing page, but you need to be able to the they have four, they have four conversations that to every sale, right? So they break it down. And I think, I think that's a lot more valuable than a LinkedIn. It's, it's, uh,

Unknown Speaker  1:18:00
anything but the LinkedIn. I just realized, Okay,

Speaker 2  1:18:07
I just, I just know that they talk to firms and corporate and like, okay, it's the it's, it's like, it's very, it's all conversational, right? So like, to me, that's where more of the magic is,

Unknown Speaker  1:18:36
anyways. Well, okay, so

Matthias Miller  1:18:38
I mean, this is one way that Melvin spends it. He's like, Well, I have plans. I have options ranging from, and then he names the price. This is for selling masterminds. I have, I have options ranging from 12,000 to 24,000 that's the range. And like, where are you thinking? Like, what kind of budget are you thinking,

Unknown Speaker  1:19:01
Yeah, okay

Matthias Miller  1:19:01
for that one, and you don't have to tell them, right? You could right that you're customizing the price to this right. But, and another question from Deborah was, Are you paying for this out of pocket, or is this sort of company paying for this because I have business and personal pricing, and you might be able to charge I mean, the Perry pricing is really probably not that, even though they could afford to spend the full corporate price on it for themselves, depending on what level they're at, that's probably more appropriate for personal pricing, and that's probably what they're close to the max of what they're going to spend. I mean, not completely. There's some,

Speaker 2  1:19:50
maybe you already have, maybe you already have this data. I just, they're they're just, maybe you're not looking for sales, conversation stuff. But they I've basically been working off of I I know, I know Perry has good material, but I found more applicable material, dare I say, From let me, let me show you.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:38
Situation, okay

Speaker 2  1:20:42
and then, well, I just, I should just start it on Amazon,

Matthias Miller  1:20:50
by the way. Oh yeah, I've heard of this. Somebody told me I should read it, and I started. And

Speaker 2  1:21:00
so he's got these two books are like my Bible right now. So he covers positioning, and then this guy covers sales, and this is Blair ends. And both have, both have been doing a podcast for years anyways, and it's like, what, what Blair ends is like, hey, it's, it's, it's, they both go together, right? You need positioning, sales, pricing, like all that. They all go together. But I think I need the sales conversations more than you do. Let's just put it that way.

Matthias Miller  1:21:53
Well, I mean, I wing sales conversations, and it's all about it's marketing. DNA is empathy. And I close six, six figure deals on handshakes by asking people what they want and listening to them and customizing it to whatever they want. And I don't pretend I feel very unqualified and untrained. I here's

Speaker 2  1:22:16
the thing, like, maybe you just need to read his win without pitching manifesto. I

Unknown Speaker  1:22:28
mean, I'm looking to

Speaker 2  1:22:31
part of, part of what I was thinking of, if you just, if you just had, if you just had, like, LinkedIn connection conversation, if you can get them to the conversation right and and either yourself or later on when with that pitching Like or doves, elegant sales conversation like sales conversation, I don't know if it needs to be more complicated than that.

Matthias Miller  1:23:11
So does the manifesto cover everything that I need to know?

Speaker 2  1:23:16
No, but you're you get a taste of the philosophy and mindset of,

Matthias Miller  1:23:23
do you think I should go through the your expert opinion is that I should go through the one without pitching workshop.

Speaker 2  1:23:28
I'm too close to this. I'm, I'm, personally, it's something I want to buy. Okay, you what video?

Unknown Speaker  1:23:37
What videos do you have?

Speaker 2  1:23:38
I have either this pricing workshop, and I can share that with you.

Matthias Miller  1:23:43
Can I bring a guest to the wind without pitching?

Unknown Speaker  1:23:47
No, but you can record it.

Unknown Speaker  1:24:01
Well.

Matthias Miller  1:24:02
I mean, the problem is, I'm out that week that's traveling. That's fair, so I can't even do September, even if I would want to. That's

Speaker 2  1:24:12
fair. You could, you could say, Hey, can I get, Can I record? Get the recordings of the previous workshop. Anyways, look, I feel like I'm pushing things now. I've been, I've been very controlling. So,

Matthias Miller  1:24:26
so, well, I fought back. Um, so, okay, now we have a new message. Angle hook. Here's

Speaker 2  1:24:36
and the reason why I bring this up is, you mentioned, you mentioned some head trash around pricing. I just know. I just, but now you're like, shooting in the moon. So maybe that's solved. I

Unknown Speaker  1:24:51
don't know if it's sold or not. He just,

Speaker 2  1:24:53
if you, I think you do need a structured, you do need a structured sales conversation. Yeah. Uh, because here's, here's the thing you already know marketing and like, are you going to go to someone else to teach you marketing? I don't know. It's like

Unknown Speaker  1:25:15
that one said, are you

Speaker 2  1:25:17
I look and that's fair. Okay, to be fair. I know some things about marketing, and I need help with marketing. So, like, we all need help with our own thing. Like, I, I get that, but I just don't, like look at what we accomplished today. Like, found that you found an angle in it, angle like, who you're speaking to, like,

Matthias Miller  1:25:44
where in the organization do you need to pitch? Yeah,

Speaker 2  1:25:47
like, like, I think you're nailing down some of the marketing questions. The you can watch the pricing workshop videos. If you think he's really good. Maybe you'd be interested in his sales conversations, but part of me is like the empathy and all that can fill in parts of the sales conversation.

Unknown Speaker  1:26:17
Let me. Let me share my Okay, so

Matthias Miller  1:26:21
here's where I want to go, I guess 13 minutes before I got a drop, here's Here's the the angle I'm anchoring for. One two.

Unknown Speaker  1:26:42
Yes, and if you want,

Unknown Speaker  1:26:52
okay, so

Matthias Miller  1:26:59
side note, well, okay, if there's, if there's one thing, if there's one thing, okay, I'm filling the event in Texas, so I'm using up my LinkedIn query with that right now. So maybe it's not as urgent as I think it is. But I mean, there's two things. One is Perry, you know, there's the, oh, what's his name? That you missed, the breaking the $4 million barrier, the coach that, whatever periods coach that he talks about, he talks about, if you, if you had to parachute into a new place and get clients, he would start with an assessment, a free assessment, and awkward interpretation. Mitch, no, we

Unknown Speaker  1:27:57
were looking at the website. I missed a meeting today,

Speaker 1  1:28:00
coffee. Oh, I'm sorry

Speaker 2  1:28:04
I wasn't a meeting. It was like an invite for Mitch to his group. That was this morning. I'll send him an email. What are you talking about, Josh? Are you talking are you talking about

Unknown Speaker  1:28:22
in Susan,

Unknown Speaker  1:28:26
the following email

Unknown Speaker  1:28:29
was here a roundtable guy, Robert

Unknown Speaker  1:28:31
Lee. Robert Lee,

Unknown Speaker  1:28:32
okay.

Unknown Speaker  1:28:41
Rob Berkeley,

Unknown Speaker  1:28:48
I guess so. One time,

Matthias Miller  1:28:51
an interview asked somebody typed in the chat box, what's your advice around new consultants gonna get new customers? Rob said, If you drop me naked in the middle of the cornfield and I had to get customers, I would have people take the Forte test, and I would do one hour reviewing their frontier test results. The point is, Rob could read it and start asking cycle questions. The test results were portal into other problems and issues which we're really struggling with, and it was his extra machine for locating the stressors. If you're talking to any professional about their stressors, you have a window into their marriage, employees, boss, suppliers, if you start talking anyway, using them as an entry point anyway. The point I'm really trying to make is, what does the connection request? Okay, let's say that we only look at coos. So So Sales Navigator CEOs of 11 to 100 person companies, and we do outreach with connection requests and look for people with shared connections to increase trust. And just say, I won't waste your time. A variant of the hell is getting a man. It could have been, do we literally send that? Yes, or do we adapt it somewhat? And then what's the follow up message? Because

Speaker 2  1:30:09
what Dov says is, you have a hand raising hand raising free offer, right? That's whether it's an assessment. Story. Clarity. Shot like, those are just different angles we test. I'm fine with an assessment, but it feels weird to be assessed from a connection

Matthias Miller  1:30:34
that just, I mean, the story makes I feel like the story, I think

Speaker 2  1:30:40
the at the end, you can say that could be the fourth, a fourth angle, if you want. But yeah, still used you can have the assessment on your website. I mean, that's, that's essentially what I have with bottleneck breakthrough now is,

Unknown Speaker  1:31:00
that's what Josh has.

Unknown Speaker  1:31:08
Do you have

Unknown Speaker  1:31:14
that's not the original LinkedIn message? What do

Unknown Speaker  1:31:19
you mean? It's not there

Unknown Speaker  1:31:20
was an original clarity shop that was like, No, I

Unknown Speaker  1:31:24
mean, it's the connection request. This is the connection request,

Speaker 2  1:31:27
yeah, but I thought there was an original, there's a previous this one. Now that's your recent one. I'm talking about, we did this two weeks ago or a week ago,

Speaker 2  1:31:54
the search, search clarity shot. I

Unknown Speaker  1:32:04
Oh, not the creator.

Unknown Speaker  1:32:13
Now, well, let's see Bobby.

Unknown Speaker  1:32:19
Oh, maybe that's it.

Unknown Speaker  1:32:21
Yeah, it's a seven minute thing,

Unknown Speaker  1:32:26
which is this one? Really?

Speaker 2  1:32:32
Oh yeah, yeah, okay, no, you're right, that's it. Yeah, I

Unknown Speaker  1:32:43
that was within the word limit. No,

Matthias Miller  1:32:48
there's a message so there's no word limit. This was a connection request. Always has been i

Unknown Speaker  1:33:11
Okay, there's something that's missing to this. I

Speaker 2  1:33:26
Okay, I think you can. I don't think now is the time to go over this you're leaving.

Matthias Miller  1:33:35
It seems like we need to take the title and cover that we put together, right, and map it on the here.

Unknown Speaker  1:33:44
That's where

Speaker 2  1:33:54
I maybe how's the man I was meeting, the man I could like I for years. Okay, can you post that Google doc in the chat? Is that I maybe already did? Oh, yeah, no, that's a different one.

Speaker 1  1:34:12
This is the okay. Sorry.

Unknown Speaker  1:34:29
For years, for years, I basically I competed with I was a second. I was in second place, out of

Speaker 2  1:34:58
stay out of second place. I spell. Felt like I was in second place

Unknown Speaker  1:35:04
now i

Unknown Speaker  1:35:09
i took second place

Speaker 2  1:35:22
for years, I took the short end of the stick.

Unknown Speaker  1:35:35
That's maybe, well, maybe,

Speaker 2  1:35:39
I don't know if that's a bad dynamic. It's a It's versus your someone's took.

Speaker 2  1:35:55
I could, I could have been a second, second in command. But I only thought thought of my self as taking second, yeah, as someone who came in second, as someone in second. I could have been I could have but my, my competitive nature, my, I

Unknown Speaker  1:36:43
I had it all as a second in command. I

Speaker 1  1:37:00
I don't know that I had it all because I didn't

Speaker 2  1:37:16
know maybe, maybe others would have, maybe others admired or respected. Others respected me as the second, but I saw myself as coming in second.

Speaker 2  1:37:36
Is it should it? Should it specify, worker, employees, workers, friends, peers, maybe my boss, my boss the CEO, because the CEO respected me as

Matthias Miller  1:37:59
because then they're not in this issue. You don't have this issue if they're respected by their boss.

Unknown Speaker  1:38:06
Okay? I just

Speaker 2  1:38:11
I wanted the respect. I wanted the respect. I wanted respect as a second as a second in command, but I but, but my CEO? Uh,

Matthias Miller  1:38:47
I wouldn't even I would point it to the CEO. They're not going to want to project it on them. Okay, the CEO my but I saw my but I saw myself. I want to respect it, but I saw myself as as second rate, as taking second place. Is taking

Speaker 2  1:39:02
second place? Great. This is, this is good, right here. Can I delete the rest? Yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:39:12
I can't believe you're asking me, Can I delete, like, can I paste this somewhere?

Speaker 2  1:39:16
Well, usually you're writing so I'm taking a backseat, okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:39:30
may not maybe.

Unknown Speaker  1:39:32
No, no, there you go. Check it out. Yeah, I

Matthias Miller  1:39:43
just like this.

Speaker 2  1:39:46
I'm here for the for the 100 proof for

Matthias Miller  1:39:52
years I want to respect this place on myself. Oh.

Unknown Speaker  1:40:01
Yeah, that was duplicated.

Unknown Speaker  1:40:10
Yeah, sure, I'm

Unknown Speaker  1:40:22
sharing my screen.

Unknown Speaker  1:40:24
Am I sharing my screen? Well,

Matthias Miller  1:40:26
I mean, we both see the same Google Doc, so Okay, okay, that's too long. But besides that, it's good. It's too long. Yeah, it's more than 300 characters.

Unknown Speaker  1:40:40
No, how do you know

Unknown Speaker  1:40:44
the other one was 290

Speaker 2  1:40:47
Okay, where's Where did you see tools, character count, word count,

Unknown Speaker  1:40:53
tools, word count.

Unknown Speaker  1:40:56
That's 363 64, I

Unknown Speaker  1:41:03
maybe this

Unknown Speaker  1:41:05
remove, 266, that's good. Do

Unknown Speaker  1:41:13
you think it's strong enough? I

Unknown Speaker  1:41:19
