Unknown Speaker  00:46
Thanks

Unknown Speaker  03:23
Good morning. Good morning. DREW Good morning Mark. Good morning on the new place to sit. I guess I've had a new place sit,

Unknown Speaker  03:32
home, office or what.

Unknown Speaker  03:35
Yeah, I wish.

Unknown Speaker  03:39
No, it's, it's a it's a little coffee shop called humble coffee

Unknown Speaker  03:46
that's in the kind of it's a little bit off the beaten path.

Unknown Speaker  03:54
But

Unknown Speaker  03:58
here I want to sit at a table, but,

Unknown Speaker  04:01
you know, things like that in there.

Unknown Speaker  04:04
And these other tables are like, yeah, it's a nice

Unknown Speaker  04:10
little space. Beth

Unknown Speaker  04:16
doesn't have good internet where he's at, so he's going to call in by phone. I send him the information. So

Unknown Speaker  04:27
good. Well, should we just jump in and get started? Should we wait on him? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  04:33
but he should be here any minute. It might be helpful to wait just a little bit

Unknown Speaker  04:38
for him. Um,

Unknown Speaker  04:40
much

Unknown Speaker  04:44
while we wait on him. Does, does,

Unknown Speaker  04:50
what did I What were the time? Does, next Wednesday, work? Do you have any openings for usually,

Unknown Speaker  04:58
meeting on theater commissions?

Unknown Speaker  05:01
I try and do a rough design, just to

Unknown Speaker  05:07
get an idea on the side. Yeah. I mean,

Unknown Speaker  05:12
I've got a standing from nine to 930 Eastern,

Unknown Speaker  05:18
if it would be all this,

Unknown Speaker  05:21
but I can,

Unknown Speaker  05:25
if it'd be all the same, I'd be happy to

Unknown Speaker  05:28
find a different time, or even,

Unknown Speaker  05:32
I guess, even

Unknown Speaker  05:34
not sure what's best

Unknown Speaker  05:42
you

Unknown Speaker  05:44
if it'd be all the same, Doing something like eight to nine

Unknown Speaker  05:49
Eastern

Unknown Speaker  05:50
but,

Unknown Speaker  05:57
or I

Unknown Speaker  06:05
Okay, we're extending it by 30 minutes earlier or later. Would

Unknown Speaker  06:10
would be great for me, but I can

Unknown Speaker  06:16
so what? What time would work ideally for you?

Unknown Speaker  06:22
Eight? To eight to nine or 10 to 11 would be better for me, but I don't know if those are options.

Unknown Speaker  06:29
That's on Wednesday, right? On Wednesday,

Unknown Speaker  06:33
I forget what times I shut down. I mean, I think 10 to 11,

Unknown Speaker  06:40
you're saying eight to nine or 10 to 11?

Unknown Speaker  06:44
Yeah, let me take,

Unknown Speaker  06:47
let you know by the end of okay. I mean, I would also be able to do one to

Unknown Speaker  06:56
anytime, from 1230 to two. You

Unknown Speaker  07:00
want to do something in the afternoon,

Unknown Speaker  07:05
or even even 1230 to 230 I guess,

Unknown Speaker  07:20
morning,

Unknown Speaker  07:26
you you're in the East. I think I heard from Josh or someone. Is that right? There you go. Yeah, I'm

Unknown Speaker  07:41
good. Well, why don't we just jump in and get started?

Unknown Speaker  07:48
What I send is

Unknown Speaker  07:52
the same list of projects I think we covered last meeting, with the exception of one, asset management reports discrepancy. And then I added

Unknown Speaker  08:01
Drew's list of development items. So I thought, let's just go through the list in order, see what's

Unknown Speaker  08:09
see what's done, see if there's any questions, and then in the end, prioritize.

Unknown Speaker  08:19
There. That sounds good.

Unknown Speaker  08:22
Okay. So the first one, asset management reporting discrepancy. I think you're familiar with the issue Matthias and I just said, let's make it so top priority so we can,

Unknown Speaker  08:35
so we can review, have a report to review. I started looking at the two reports you sent yesterday was like, There's no way I can merge the two. Like I had been hopeful that I could so and you'd said, said set Seth, could probably put something together pretty quickly. So

Unknown Speaker  08:54
let's update that reporting then that will allow us to

Unknown Speaker  08:59
see that that what we have included in that asset, see that that's correct, and then we can do the sale of acid. It's a rent it's part we have one renovation house that was sold

Unknown Speaker  09:13
june 14, yeah, but

Unknown Speaker  09:15
as soon as we have that, then we can verify and make that sale. So well, could we actually just do this?

Unknown Speaker  09:25
I guess, Seth, if you want to try to log in so you get screen sharing, it could be helpful, but you'll have to,

Unknown Speaker  09:34
because we it

Unknown Speaker  09:37
tends to be glitchy, which is why I just called it. Sorry. You're to

Unknown Speaker  09:51
meet that sale of acid pretty straight. We think it's pretty straightforward

Unknown Speaker  09:59
to the do.

Unknown Speaker  10:00
Million Teresa

Unknown Speaker  10:03
so on the

Unknown Speaker  10:09
this would be shed time.

Unknown Speaker  10:17
So the link transactions here,

Unknown Speaker  10:22
we want the

Unknown Speaker  10:41
Jane want it?

Unknown Speaker  10:44
Do you want it grouped by?

Unknown Speaker  10:48
How are we doing this with

Unknown Speaker  10:50
doing it grouped by account or something?

Unknown Speaker  11:00
So if they're looking at it like these expenses, no, I think grouping by yeah contact would be, would probably be the most helpful group by contact, or,

Unknown Speaker  11:11
yeah, sure, let's Do that.

Unknown Speaker  11:18
Because what they're looking for here is,

Unknown Speaker  11:22
yeah,

Unknown Speaker  11:24
do you want reference or anything on any of these? I forget what? Yeah, reference is good, because we can,

Unknown Speaker  11:33
if we have questions on something, that's an easy way to get to the source document. Well, in the account TransLink notes,

Unknown Speaker  11:42
could maybe we don't actually mean that sometimes does have,

Unknown Speaker  11:49
I don't know if that matters. That's good,

Unknown Speaker  11:53
something like that.

Unknown Speaker  11:55
Yeah, all

Unknown Speaker  11:57
right.

Unknown Speaker  11:59
Do you want all the credit market.

Unknown Speaker  12:03
Oh, no, that

Unknown Speaker  12:08
okay.

Unknown Speaker  12:09
We only want to see

Unknown Speaker  12:13
accounts, the 12, 1207, accounts. Yeah, that would be

Unknown Speaker  12:18
the only thing we

Unknown Speaker  12:21
Yeah. Can we just

Unknown Speaker  12:23
1207

Unknown Speaker  12:26
what's the best way to can

Unknown Speaker  12:29
we just filter by expense the expense accounts?

Unknown Speaker  12:33
So what is 1207

Unknown Speaker  12:36
uh, an asset, a fixed asset, like we've done this on the transactions by contact report, where we, yeah, I think go to

Unknown Speaker  12:47
asset accounts that should work, because the only thing attached to that is going to be interested. Accountant, yeah, asset and do the also do some type of fixed asset, because,

Unknown Speaker  12:59
if not, we get all the accumulated depreciate, folks right,

Unknown Speaker  13:06
Type

Unknown Speaker  13:08
local accounts to include.

Unknown Speaker  13:13
Let's do this.

Unknown Speaker  13:22
Over here.

Unknown Speaker  13:34
No,

Unknown Speaker  13:36
what I wanted. I

Unknown Speaker  14:00
me, actually, we should probably

Unknown Speaker  14:04
let's just do this

Unknown Speaker  14:07
asset and

Unknown Speaker  14:16
not sure about hard I'm not sure about hardcoding this though. I

Unknown Speaker  14:30
wouldn't there be a way to determine off the asset itself? Do

Unknown Speaker  14:45
couldn't we exclude i.

Unknown Speaker  15:04
What I want

Unknown Speaker  15:06
in purchased asset accounts I

Unknown Speaker  15:23
if it's a, it's a, if It's a passage

Unknown Speaker  15:33
here, let's Do this,

Unknown Speaker  15:40
if It's

Unknown Speaker  15:46
here, I

Unknown Speaker  16:39
all right, I know this is

Unknown Speaker  16:42
bordering in a waste of time, but

Unknown Speaker  16:51
account trans line account,

Unknown Speaker  17:01
all right, so here we should then see, we see a debit total of

Unknown Speaker  17:07
139, 269, 12. That's not right, is it?

Unknown Speaker  17:20
Let's do this. No,

Unknown Speaker  17:29
remember your transaction tools on the report you sent yesterday was 211,000

Unknown Speaker  17:36
just over 200,000 I believe I

Unknown Speaker  17:47
well, okay, here,

Unknown Speaker  17:50
ignoring all that I

Unknown Speaker  18:04
we're just,

Unknown Speaker  18:06
it's including the wrong ones, but Seth, Seth will make sure they they match up.

Unknown Speaker  18:16
So apart from, apart from the numbers being wrong and potentially having the wrong accounts. Do you like it?

Unknown Speaker  18:27
So the reference is,

Unknown Speaker  18:30
is

Unknown Speaker  18:32
like check number or,

Unknown Speaker  18:39
yeah,

Unknown Speaker  18:42
I'm not sure where the vendor, where the vendor invoice isn't

Unknown Speaker  18:46
so

Unknown Speaker  18:48
Okay, looking at the report again, like we've got

Unknown Speaker  18:53
Nipsco

Unknown Speaker  18:56
the date, and

Unknown Speaker  18:58
then we've got notes, that's,

Unknown Speaker  19:02
I think that's good. What do you think, too? Like, if, if I were to look at that and say, like, for this one, I know that they kept pretty good track of obviously, and then sent that information in. And,

Unknown Speaker  19:18
yeah, I mean, it's that reference is giving the payment reference, not the not the invoice number,

Unknown Speaker  19:27
right?

Unknown Speaker  19:29
I mean, I don't

Unknown Speaker  19:32
that.

Unknown Speaker  19:34
I'm just trying to think if we could simplify it. I'm not sure that the reference column would need to be there. I was debating whether the account, I think the account is held below and it's not, it should all be the same.

Unknown Speaker  19:49
Well, no, no, you're going to have, you could potentially have

Unknown Speaker  19:55
buildings or, well, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  19:59
ah.

Unknown Speaker  20:00
Okay, yeah, like, there's that production fixtures is okay, what's the criteria? What's what's, what determines whether something is here or not?

Unknown Speaker  20:13
Well, I thought it was something like, if it's an asset account and not. I

Unknown Speaker  20:23
The depreciation expense account or something like that.

Unknown Speaker  20:31
I don't know that it should exclude an active either.

Unknown Speaker  20:35
Let's try that. No, I

Unknown Speaker  20:50
I have this.

Unknown Speaker  20:53
It's not in the Exclude and it's an asset.

Unknown Speaker  21:02
I don't know so but, but it

Unknown Speaker  21:06
okay. Is there a way that we can verify that, looking at this list, that it matches what the asset management total is on the asset itself?

Unknown Speaker  21:16
I mean, we can leave Seth to do that. I don't know that we need to take time now. Okay, well, that's, that's my only concern is that that we're ensured that this total matches the total when we go to make a sale of an asset, and you're saying that's what Seth is going to do. Yes, okay, good. I like it.

Unknown Speaker  21:37
Alright, so then this will be so

Unknown Speaker  21:44
so we want a user report for now,

Unknown Speaker  21:50
send Drew and mark and then

Unknown Speaker  21:54
post, sign off. Standardized report

Unknown Speaker  22:02
should be okay

Unknown Speaker  22:05
replace

Unknown Speaker  22:07
linked transactions report. I'm

Unknown Speaker  22:11
trying to think one more thing here before we get too far In

Unknown Speaker  22:18
the Link transactions. I

Unknown Speaker  22:29
We have this,

Unknown Speaker  22:37
actually,

Unknown Speaker  22:42
I

Unknown Speaker  23:05
I think we should actually,

Unknown Speaker  23:22
I

Unknown Speaker  23:36
let's add An only include purchase transactions.

Unknown Speaker  23:40
You have a,

Unknown Speaker  23:55
I don't really care,

Unknown Speaker  23:59
all right, as long as, as long as they've got an easy way to, you know, as long as for them, either it's a link or there's a way to that, it defaults to just showing purchase transactions. I'm fine.

Unknown Speaker  24:11
Good. Seth,

Unknown Speaker  24:14
okay.

Unknown Speaker  24:19
Okay, good.

Unknown Speaker  24:24
So while we're on that, that user report, what's reasonable ETA on having that user report for this 449, house,

Unknown Speaker  24:35
is it this week? Yet, today or I

Unknown Speaker  24:44
top priority.

Unknown Speaker  24:47
So within two hours of the call, easily two hours of when we end right,

Unknown Speaker  24:55
probably, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  25:00
Or, yeah, or by, I mean, for sure, by end of day, I would Yeah, well,

Unknown Speaker  25:11
we'll see it once it comes so and then we'll just make that sale.

Unknown Speaker  25:20
Sounds good.

Unknown Speaker  25:25
Okay, so the rest of the stuff is things we'd covered before, so I'm not

Unknown Speaker  25:31
going to take time and read through each one, so just looking at two,

Unknown Speaker  25:37
any any updates there

Unknown Speaker  25:41
should be coming.

Unknown Speaker  25:47
We can't hear you set

Unknown Speaker  25:51
it should be coming

Unknown Speaker  25:53
through.

Unknown Speaker  25:56
It's very faint. I

Unknown Speaker  26:04
Is this better?

Unknown Speaker  26:07
Are you talking through your headset? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  26:11
maybe tiny bit, sure. Almost sounds like there's some noise cancelation or something in play that's thinks here in the background. But I'm not sure I

Unknown Speaker  26:32
it is it better?

Unknown Speaker  26:34
Yep, that's better.

Unknown Speaker  26:37
Well, I just I don't know what my time needs to

Unknown Speaker  26:42
be. Speaker for now, so we'll do that.

Unknown Speaker  26:46
Two through five are done strictly with the next update.

Unknown Speaker  26:52
Okay, what's the next update? Got it?

Unknown Speaker  26:55
Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  27:01
okay,

Unknown Speaker  27:08
well, that was easy on that.

Unknown Speaker  27:12
So Okay,

Unknown Speaker  27:18
think they should all be fine.

Unknown Speaker  27:20
Okay, good. What about the paper cut projects,

Unknown Speaker  27:27
the first two,

Unknown Speaker  27:29
first two done,

Unknown Speaker  27:32
and with next update, right?

Unknown Speaker  27:36
Yeah, okay. Do

Unknown Speaker  27:46
Okay, and then so I don't, unless you have questions, I don't think it's worth their time looking at the others.

Unknown Speaker  27:56
Yeah, I'll just keep going through another I guess. Okay, so then let's go to Drew's list and

Unknown Speaker  28:08
go through each one of those, and then we'll prioritize them and update the list.

Unknown Speaker  28:22
So Seth, where are you at with changing the maybe this is on this list,

Unknown Speaker  28:30
changing the event types that we had outlined previously, renaming them,

Unknown Speaker  28:38
the Rename,

Unknown Speaker  28:41
the Rename they're done.

Unknown Speaker  28:46
Wait. Sorry, which one is this?

Unknown Speaker  28:51
This is for the account transaction,

Unknown Speaker  28:54
the accounting impact. I

Unknown Speaker  29:00
it.

Unknown Speaker  29:07
Maybe it's just not loud yet.

Unknown Speaker  29:11
Well, I'm trying to figure out I had so many different bits and pieces. Helps that it gets confusing.

Unknown Speaker  29:18
Just

Unknown Speaker  29:21
looking at my report here on my side,

Unknown Speaker  29:32
they just sent me via

Unknown Speaker  29:37
email.

Unknown Speaker  29:40
Actually. Let's start with the

Unknown Speaker  29:53
um.

Unknown Speaker  30:01
This guy,

Unknown Speaker  30:04
the way it's not,

Unknown Speaker  30:08
you see if it's still search,

Unknown Speaker  30:22
um, I think we said Paul's in your court to prioritize, and it never did. So this would be the next well, so let me send this over to you, so you shot it,

Unknown Speaker  30:37
and then it sounds big as money, but I don't remember seeing him like you.

Unknown Speaker  30:42
I've forgot to sign into to you,

Unknown Speaker  30:47
so we're renaming these two obsolete type. But it

Unknown Speaker  30:53
didn't, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  30:55
only using those payment and then once everything's successfully migrated, absolutely and

Unknown Speaker  31:01
then the testing for that. The testing Okay, so I don't think that much work, but I

Unknown Speaker  31:10
think something that can get done this week before the next update.

Unknown Speaker  31:15
Does that sound right?

Unknown Speaker  31:17
It does to me,

Unknown Speaker  31:19
and that would be all of your number one, right? Yeah, yeah. Now,

Unknown Speaker  31:26
well, I guess if it can be done for the update this week, then we might as well just leave that block in place, and it's not very bad.

Unknown Speaker  31:34
Oh, because yeah, like when they make that switch, they should no longer be receiving this block that they're getting.

Unknown Speaker  31:44
So, but for now, we'll just let them get the block if we can have it by by next week, anyway. So,

Unknown Speaker  31:55
okay, well, go ahead. DREW You. You put this together. So

Unknown Speaker  31:59
the little items the credit memo list,

Unknown Speaker  32:07
which I was pulling those up, and the check box for used, and it appears that the only thing used is the ones that go back to vendor invoices and are applied to a vendor invoice.

Unknown Speaker  32:24
So I just like to add to that criteria, if it's returned to payment method,

Unknown Speaker  32:30
then it automatically be considered used,

Unknown Speaker  32:36
because, like, that's kind of a after the fact entry.

Unknown Speaker  32:47
So

Unknown Speaker  32:50
let's do all of them.

Unknown Speaker  32:55
Wait include used

Unknown Speaker  32:59
so the usage apply,

Unknown Speaker  33:10
the returned original payment method.

Unknown Speaker  33:14
So you want these,

Unknown Speaker  33:20
I would like those to be thought of as it's used, it's done. It's not an outstanding credit man, because they've already given us our money back.

Unknown Speaker  33:33
We only see something here. How does this hit?

Unknown Speaker  33:41
Right? Because we have the credit

Unknown Speaker  33:44
as of exact date. Let

Unknown Speaker  33:48
me just,

Unknown Speaker  34:01
I just memoids.

Unknown Speaker  34:19
We take all the credit memos,

Unknown Speaker  34:27
and

Unknown Speaker  34:34
if it's

Unknown Speaker  34:37
if we apply to the

Unknown Speaker  34:44
Okay,

Unknown Speaker  34:46
so I think I.

Unknown Speaker  35:16
Is that

Unknown Speaker  35:21
what you're thinking? I

Unknown Speaker  35:27
like, where does it return to zero? Well, just as a balancing entry.

Unknown Speaker  35:33
Well, I'm sorry, when, when we,

Unknown Speaker  35:39
yeah, basically what we what we will say is, if

Unknown Speaker  35:43
on each memo, we keep track

Unknown Speaker  35:48
how much of the credit memo is left.

Unknown Speaker  35:53
So we've already pushed it to accounting, and so basically we'll just say, if you said it's going to return, then you've used up the entire credit memo. I

Unknown Speaker  36:03
let's do this.

Unknown Speaker  36:12
I mean, I think this is, I

Unknown Speaker  36:25
Okay. I mean, I'm happy with that. I think that kind of, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  36:30
Then the other change would be to the wait for deposit ones.

Unknown Speaker  36:37
I'm not exactly sure how the accounting works on here, like, technically, wait for a deposit would be like receiving an invoice. You know, they're saying they're paying us, even if we don't have the check we no longer are are due that amount.

Unknown Speaker  36:53
But I'm just thinking, if you know, if it goes into a deposit, let's have a link to that deposit and have it come off of that used list.

Unknown Speaker  37:03
Do we put these on the deposit itself?

Unknown Speaker  37:06
Yeah, down there? Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  37:18
Okay, so I

Unknown Speaker  37:39
Well,

Unknown Speaker  37:49
cool.

Unknown Speaker  37:55
And then the point of inner invoice is as it already is, yeah, I think that's how it already is. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  38:05
it was included in once it's been deposited for the week. Anybody positive? Are you okay? If that's just a report that's something like new deposits, and it shows any link deposits? Yeah, that should be fine, just for doing

Unknown Speaker  38:18
some most of what I want is something to indicate on the credit memo that, yes, this one actually has now gotten deposit, because all it says is, wait for deposit. And unless you know what deposit it was in, there's no

Unknown Speaker  38:35
like, I haven't found any, you know, just something that says, Here it was in this deposit. I positive.

Unknown Speaker  38:46
This would show you Yeah, yeah. That would work

Unknown Speaker  38:50
unless you specifically need to go hunt down to I mean, well, I mean the link just would make it handy to go find we should have,

Unknown Speaker  39:01
like, Yeah, we should have at least know what deposit was.

Unknown Speaker  39:05
Do you know if

Unknown Speaker  39:10
deposit, if credit numbers can be broken into multiple deposits, or is it just one deposit per credit number?

Unknown Speaker  39:20
Let's do this.

Unknown Speaker  39:37
That would be my vote. We'll

Unknown Speaker  39:39
have to really head down

Unknown Speaker  39:42
and not that much data.

Unknown Speaker  39:55
Yes,

Unknown Speaker  39:59
we.

Unknown Speaker  40:00
Be I think there's probably one ready, but I'm not sure

Unknown Speaker  40:10
good that should be it for that one, the quick enter vendor invoice

Unknown Speaker  40:16
page, like from the reconciles and go to the quick enter, quick enter in vendor invoices,

Unknown Speaker  40:25
there's a selector for what payment type, but the vendor that you select that the payment type with that vendor will always override

Unknown Speaker  40:37
the prior selected payment type for the page that you're entering into.

Unknown Speaker  40:45
Alright? So Jim, an example off the top of your head. So yeah, like, just go to, yeah, primary capital. So this would be, I would be coming from the Capital One reconcile, and saying, Okay, here's ones that I need to enter. So put like Burke holder transport in there.

Unknown Speaker  41:10
That switches to E payment, which would be the right idea if I were just doing regular entries. But in this case, I'm coming from that specific payment type, so everything on here is going to be that. So I'm just thinking have this payment type, whatever is originally selected when you open the page, that's just

Unknown Speaker  41:31
default, even if the vendor says something else

Unknown Speaker  41:37
about the vendor, right? No, I don't want to change because

Unknown Speaker  41:45
a lot of it actually part of the issue is like Lowe's.

Unknown Speaker  41:54
You know, the default set for Lowe's is the Lowe's cards, but they go in and buy things all the time with their capital one cards, like the transport guys do.

Unknown Speaker  42:08
So you know. So every time it's Lowe's on Capital One card, if I'm doing the entry,

Unknown Speaker  42:14
which I've learned, to go to Lowe's first and check that account

Unknown Speaker  42:19
and then change all of them over to Capital One, and then there's a lot less. But yeah,

Unknown Speaker  42:25
do you ever need

Unknown Speaker  42:30
to change the payment type from what you set initially?

Unknown Speaker  42:36
I mean, I never have, because I'm always coming from that particular types reconcile statement, you know, looking at that now,

Unknown Speaker  42:49
I didn't know what it would do if I would put multiple payment types in, like, does it just simply write invoices?

Unknown Speaker  42:58
You know, that's all that happens.

Unknown Speaker  43:01
We could simplify it, if this would not be editable, editable and it would always just show what you selected, and then we would force it to save like that.

Unknown Speaker  43:10
That would be fine with me. Okay. I

Unknown Speaker  43:20
It

Unknown Speaker  43:39
makes sense, sirs,

Unknown Speaker  43:46
keeps it relatively localized. I mean, I guess there might even be a,

Unknown Speaker  43:51
we have a way to do change expressions on the new records report. That's what I was wondering. I'll look at it just a little bit if there's a changes.

Unknown Speaker  44:02
Yeah, so be better, if you can

Unknown Speaker  44:10
All right,

Unknown Speaker  44:20
so

Unknown Speaker  44:23
Oh, well, this is simple.

Unknown Speaker  44:26
We're not respecting the district

Unknown Speaker  44:31
fair enough,

Unknown Speaker  44:34
and just turning this into a link.

Unknown Speaker  44:37
Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  44:39
I mean, we have

Unknown Speaker  44:43
a

Unknown Speaker  44:47
you can either there's either you can either do an any explained field to get the so num ID,

Unknown Speaker  44:55
or there's also a report that pulls it up by so ID, I don't so no IDs.

Unknown Speaker  45:00
Is probably technically a better way to do it, but the passing it into report the poll so Id should be fine, and

Unknown Speaker  45:12
that's just a link over the scope

Unknown Speaker  45:18
in your game,

Unknown Speaker  45:20
right?

Unknown Speaker  45:28
On the stripe. Payouts, Matthias, did you get anywhere with the email I sent over? I think was yesterday, good morning, maybe

Unknown Speaker  45:38
about the strike payout that

Unknown Speaker  45:43
yeah,

Unknown Speaker  45:49
it doesn't list an so ID.

Unknown Speaker  45:53
Well, all messed up.

Unknown Speaker  45:57
That's really messed up.

Unknown Speaker  46:00
I have, I don't think I found any of those. Well, maybe I did find the 2100 but it's not related.

Unknown Speaker  46:09
Let's don't believe so.

Unknown Speaker  46:12
Well, strike payout, payment, maybe.

Unknown Speaker  46:22
So I'm gonna guess somebody

Unknown Speaker  46:25
deleted a sales order.

Unknown Speaker  46:29
What's disturbing is I actually have that amount on that

Unknown Speaker  46:34
statement, so they might have deleted the sales order. Never refunded them the money, or, I don't know,

Unknown Speaker  46:42
customers can I think this is it?

Unknown Speaker  46:45
Well, there's also, let's

Unknown Speaker  46:48
try the transaction. I knew that would be a better

Unknown Speaker  46:55
values.

Unknown Speaker  47:02
I mean,

Unknown Speaker  47:03
seven, eight.

Unknown Speaker  47:06
I mean they said they don't have a report

Unknown Speaker  47:10
for

Unknown Speaker  47:12
that amount.

Unknown Speaker  47:16
He's or one of them

Unknown Speaker  47:18
now,

Unknown Speaker  47:20
I mean, I found one that looked like it would make sense,

Unknown Speaker  47:23
but it might have been a different you know, they're both for 5000 which is a little bit more than this. So there was another sale for 5005

Unknown Speaker  47:34
so it might have been balanced. So if you ain't, quiet again.

Unknown Speaker  47:40
Seth, what were you saying?

Unknown Speaker  47:43
Oh, I was just, I don't know how all the linking stuff works, so,

Unknown Speaker  47:50
but yeah, I

Unknown Speaker  48:16
I Don't know.

Unknown Speaker  48:17
Let me

Unknown Speaker  48:20
see if I've got

Unknown Speaker  48:22
think I had, at one point, gotten

Unknown Speaker  48:30
stripe Access Manager. I

Unknown Speaker  48:49
we don't even know what it is

Unknown Speaker  48:55
we deemed

Unknown Speaker  48:59
Well, I had accepted the invite,

Unknown Speaker  49:03
but I don't have access to,

Unknown Speaker  49:09
could you

Unknown Speaker  49:12
pull up the

Unknown Speaker  49:17
Could You pull up the stripe, this transactional stripe?

Unknown Speaker  49:21
Well,

Unknown Speaker  49:23
one of them over at Berman's office.

Unknown Speaker  49:29
Should we? Should we get Dwayne?

Unknown Speaker  49:32
Get Dwayne?

Unknown Speaker  49:36
Yeah, we could. Maybe I had sent him the same thing. He had said that he's not, he's not finding anything.

Unknown Speaker  49:45
Um,

Unknown Speaker  49:49
2100 and

Unknown Speaker  49:51
here is one. Here, let me. Let me try this again. I.

Unknown Speaker  50:04
Sales Order.

Unknown Speaker  50:09
I mean, there's this one

Unknown Speaker  50:15
which happens to be for a different one in the same amount.

Unknown Speaker  50:22
Well, okay, do you have

Unknown Speaker  50:25
access to the

Unknown Speaker  50:27
Stripe account?

Unknown Speaker  50:37
That

Unknown Speaker  50:38
you can pull it up we can pull it up. We can look at that. No,

Unknown Speaker  50:44
um, sent me an email with a screenshot

Unknown Speaker  50:55
available The

Unknown Speaker  51:00
the end is off white.

Unknown Speaker  51:11
Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  51:14
we shake these

Unknown Speaker  51:23
Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  51:31
guys, you've reached out to Dwayne, or you're not waiting for me to Yeah, no, I reached out. He saw it, so we'll see if he's hopping on.

Unknown Speaker  51:39
I told him it's most because I just missed seeing his face. But it'd be nice to fix a stripe issue too. While we can

Unknown Speaker  51:49
there's one minute. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  51:51
good.

Unknown Speaker  51:59
So Matthias,

Unknown Speaker  52:03
oh, the

Unknown Speaker  52:05
verify with Dwayne. We can verify with Dwayne yet, but 1230 to

Unknown Speaker  52:10
130 Wednesday would work for me. If it worked for you and said,

Unknown Speaker  52:17
Seth, we were trying to schedule that meeting, I'd send out an email yesterday. I think you said Tuesday won't work. Uh, Wednesday,

Unknown Speaker  52:26
the times would work. So would would 1230 to 130 work for you?

Unknown Speaker  52:33
Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  52:36
was, was that a yes?

Unknown Speaker  52:39
Yes. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  52:41
let's ask.

Unknown Speaker  52:58
No, it didn't look like it looked like a good deal, 60% discount.

Unknown Speaker  53:06
Did they turn out to be good

Unknown Speaker  53:10
quality or whatever? Yeah, it wasn't like they were just no cheap odors. Give

Unknown Speaker  53:16
it as a gift

Unknown Speaker  53:20
and later.

Unknown Speaker  53:24
But these, these were charges that were refunded. So,

Unknown Speaker  53:31
so these don't matter. This is the one that

Unknown Speaker  53:35
this is. This is the one to be concerned. I mean, the I

Unknown Speaker  53:57
the bank account shows that the 4800

Unknown Speaker  54:01
is what actually happened.

Unknown Speaker  54:05
4813,

Unknown Speaker  54:06
yeah,

Unknown Speaker  54:10
we're enjoying wait. Good morning. Good morning. Morning.

Unknown Speaker  54:16
I haven't seen, but here's some faces I haven't seen in a long

Unknown Speaker  54:21
right back at you.

Unknown Speaker  54:24
Indeed,

Unknown Speaker  54:29
Leanne had shared stripe access to me a while back, and I don't know how to get into it. Actually, it's but

Unknown Speaker  54:37
is there anything on the transaction that indicates whether it was done through the portal versus through manual. Bring me up to speed on what we're talking about. Sorry, this guy right here. Let me share.

Unknown Speaker  54:50
Oh, yeah, this fun one, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  54:57
See it looks to me like, okay, so So drew what you're saying.

Unknown Speaker  55:00
Is this posted amount is these three

Unknown Speaker  55:06
and these, but not the refunds.

Unknown Speaker  55:10
Matthias. Can you copy that stripe ID of the of the main rep detail screen there

Unknown Speaker  55:16
and chat it to me so I can drop it into stripe here and look this thing up? Yep, I You

Unknown Speaker  55:26
want

Unknown Speaker  55:30
me to, you want me to share my stripe screen so we can see this, yeah, yeah. If you want to share the payout and we can at least, let's start continuing to look at what stripe of the payout should be and what we you.

Unknown Speaker  55:45
All right, you can see, yep,

Unknown Speaker  55:49
okay, 2038,

Unknown Speaker  55:51
80, okay, so I mean, this is exactly

Unknown Speaker  55:56
okay, but scroll,

Unknown Speaker  55:59
wait, there's a 27

Unknown Speaker  56:02
there's 227 twelves.

Unknown Speaker  56:05
Yeah, so, so this is, this was a, this particular payout is over a time frame that we had that whole glitch with where we had redone the the stripe

Unknown Speaker  56:19
fee, and we were doing it as a new as a new line item on the in the RG, and we didn't, weren't able to do negative transactions. And so we had a bunch of transactions where people were trying to dealers have this very bad habit when they think it doesn't go through, they try again. And so as we can see here, 2038 2038 2038 2030

Unknown Speaker  56:40
hey, let's just pay off your building right away. Hey, I mean, so yeah, so the Jeff Haddon one was the same thing. So, yeah, 2027, 12, and

Unknown Speaker  56:49
then there was a refund up here as well for it.

Unknown Speaker  56:55
But this is not what we're seeing. This is not before

Unknown Speaker  56:59
we're not seeing all the line item No, right?

Unknown Speaker  57:04
Yeah, we're missing all the line items, missing the bottom three, right?

Unknown Speaker  57:10
I don't know. I yeah, there's no more here to show you. I know what it is. I know what it is. I will bet you this is the first time that's kind of 123456789,

Unknown Speaker  57:22
ah. Nine, I don't know. I'll bet you. This is the first time we've had this many rows on a payout, and we're not paging payouts

Unknown Speaker  57:32
when, when we're doing our API calls. So we're getting the first page of

Unknown Speaker  57:36
of charges.

Unknown Speaker  57:38
Yeah. I mean, if, if you do, I wonder if are you getting,

Unknown Speaker  57:43
are you getting this version? Hang on one second.

Unknown Speaker  57:48
So are you getting this many on Tuesday, 456, yeah, that many. So there is a second page to it.

Unknown Speaker  57:57
I

Unknown Speaker  58:03
Yeah, and that would essentially add

Unknown Speaker  58:07
60, 7400,

Unknown Speaker  58:12
that would come out pretty near right, without actually being a man,

Unknown Speaker  58:17
yeah. I mean, that's the issue. Now. That doesn't solve the issue of or do you not care at that point that these are wonky and never recorded anywhere like Donald Fisher,

Unknown Speaker  58:32
291, we

Unknown Speaker  58:37
charged him when he's not linked to a sales order. Yeah, but I mean, no, that they are, if I'm not mistaken, I think they are.

Unknown Speaker  58:46
Are they not? Not, not on, not on this one? So let's go. Donald Fisher, let's go find his sales

Unknown Speaker  58:55
Order. Donald I

Unknown Speaker  59:15
don't l Fisher

Unknown Speaker  59:22
people,

Unknown Speaker  59:32
yeah, right. John Fisher,

Unknown Speaker  59:37
336, 25 three,

Unknown Speaker  59:41
and there was a, is there, is there a refund that's tied to this as well?

Unknown Speaker  59:46
Yeah, similar.

Unknown Speaker  59:48
Somewhere. There should be a refund for that, I think at a later date for that. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  59:54
if you go, if you go on the charge, I saw something on refund, back in strength, clicking.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:00
Into that, and it says, canceled order. Yep, successfully read from the Doom to the customer's request. So

Unknown Speaker  1:00:10
that probably comes, so that probably came on in a different payout, a different time frame,

Unknown Speaker  1:00:16
probably, oh, so, I mean, I guess, good. Where was it listed as cash.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:24
Cash was a different amount. It doesn't match up,

Unknown Speaker  1:00:29
probably because we never tied this one out to the to the this one was probably never tied out to the

Unknown Speaker  1:00:37
the transaction ID again. This

Unknown Speaker  1:00:39
was all in that time frame where we weren't able to run credit card. Credit cards. There was a lot of manual

Unknown Speaker  1:00:46
stuff happening.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:52
I can, I can tie this one in real fast if you want.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:59
Well,

Unknown Speaker  1:01:01
I mean, if the strike payout has all the lines,

Unknown Speaker  1:01:06
that's all that I need,

Unknown Speaker  1:01:09
okay, but,

Unknown Speaker  1:01:10
but we need to make sure that all of these,

Unknown Speaker  1:01:15
I mean, at least the ending positive amount is on the sales orders.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:29
So Dwayne, I don't know which way you want that. I mean, like we need this Jeff Hayden to have at least showing a payment for 2712,

Unknown Speaker  1:01:38
is he not showing that? I don't know I I didn't have any way of figuring out what sales orders all these lines actually go to, because it doesn't say on the stripe payment side in the situs. I

Unknown Speaker  1:02:03
Oh,

Unknown Speaker  1:02:12
you stupid bar, how do I make you move go away? Just just to cut through the chase. Here, Josh has a problem, which I replied to the email he knows what to fix. Apart from that, this is now a Dwayne and drew problem to go figure out and link out the payments to the right sales order, right?

Unknown Speaker  1:02:34
So if we were to write new payments in there, what's going to happen? I

Unknown Speaker  1:02:43
Well, if we, I would think, if we tie out the PI numbers, then it should, it should tie out to your, to your payout, right?

Unknown Speaker  1:02:54
If they're all, all the lines are included, right?

Unknown Speaker  1:02:58
Yeah. I mean, we will push,

Unknown Speaker  1:03:03
new accounting transactions. Yeah, the issue here here,

Unknown Speaker  1:03:07
let's let me, let me take over my I'm

Unknown Speaker  1:03:10
going to

Unknown Speaker  1:03:12
kick you out. Doreen,

Unknown Speaker  1:03:15
the issue here is that let

Unknown Speaker  1:03:21
me export this to Excel, to confirm.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:30
Okay, when you sum these, you get 2026,

Unknown Speaker  1:03:35
5151

Unknown Speaker  1:03:37
40, right, which is the stripe amount. So this amount is wrong because it's only showing the first nine, and if you would add them the last, however many, then this total would match this total, which would make this total be correct. Right now, it doesn't do anything with stripe tie outs or sales order tie outs, but at least you'd be able to reconcile your bank account, because this is

Unknown Speaker  1:04:03
right, right. So how

Unknown Speaker  1:04:07
this transaction? How did it get put into

Unknown Speaker  1:04:13
a sense? I mean, is it just coming from stripe said that they paid out this much, so therefore goes in here, or is it stemming from people entering multiple lines. No, there's automation that creates a stripe. Record, Stripe payout. Record, fills in all this stuff. Fills in all this stuff. There's a bug. It missed a few lines, and then, and then the accounting impact will create this transaction.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:38
So then, so we we fix that bug. We get this complete transaction in place. Dwayne has to figure out how to hook up his sales orders to his payout. If you want to, if it's if it's important to you, if not, it'll just show up here as a stripe chart. Well.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:00
Some straight charges with an unknown sales order.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:09
I would also correct I would also observe that

Unknown Speaker  1:05:18
wait, 646,

Unknown Speaker  1:05:26
this is exactly why we created this report in the first place, right? And that we said somebody should be stuck make sure it balances out anyway. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:44
So

Unknown Speaker  1:05:46
fair enough. Yep,

Unknown Speaker  1:05:49
do you have what we need to fix this? Um, no, I don't have any. Like. What I've learned is that I don't need to do anything. It's just going to come out, right if I wait a little bit, it's it's in Josh's court, and you need to push on if you need it done sooner rather than later. You need to push on Josh, to fix it. Those are not the words you want to hear from accountant. If I just wait long enough, it'll just all come out.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:13
Dwayne, that's the kind of accounting you love. Man, that is the kind of like, Listen, if that's how accounting works, I'm becoming an accountant.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:21
I'm in the wrong field. It is when you have good AR team and a good developer.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:29
Yeah, now we see we're just minions working for Drew

Unknown Speaker  1:06:36
you slipped up there. Drew you. Let you left a leakage come out of exactly how it really is, I see,

Unknown Speaker  1:06:44
we'll keep it under wraps

Unknown Speaker  1:06:48
that that's better than a creative account. I think Josh is saying somebody said he's

Unknown Speaker  1:06:54
talking to somebody that said, you don't want me to be creative. Creative accountants go to jail.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:01
Yeah, they do.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:03
I also remember somebody talking about, I can't remember where I was telling the story to somebody else recently, somebody was talking to a bookkeeper accounting account, and they were just talking about how interesting their job is. And they're like, don't you do the same thing every single day? They're like, Well, I mean, yeah, you're always doing whatever, entering numbers and all this other but there's always something you know unusual with, you know, I don't know different situations that come up like Well

Unknown Speaker  1:07:31
To each his own.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:36
But in all, in all seriousness, like these sales orders, do we have a plan or not fix those? Yes, we do.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:46
I'm looking at, interestingly enough, all of the Jeff Haddon ones look like. When I searched stripe, it looks like they were all there was payments made and payments were funded. The stripe payout itself does not have, I don't think all the refunds in for it. So I'm going to go dig a little bit further and make it looks like maybe one of the refunds went into the next day.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:10
Well, all the rest of my payouts, according to the bank, do match and line up. So this is the only one that doesn't, doesn't match what the bank received. So, so Dwayne reflects that on the sales order. Then you will have, then it should all be, yeah, it should be just this payment.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:32
Good, yep. Okay, great. Well, that was helpful. Wayne,

Unknown Speaker  1:08:37
Dwayne just 30 seconds while you're on. Would it work for you to do a 1230 to 130 Wednesday

Unknown Speaker  1:08:46
the September? Yeah, I actually, I actually started that email back to you, and obviously I never sent it back

Unknown Speaker  1:08:52
to you. It works for the rest of us. If that time it worked for you, 1230 to 130 on the 11th.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:02
Well, what I let's see 1230

Unknown Speaker  1:09:06
Yes, 1230 to 130 you said, Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:09:12
alright. Is there? Matthias, you already have an invite going. I'm, I'm as soon as you say you're good to go, it's going out, although, although it seems like maybe we shouldn't set it on that day. It is September 11, after all.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:27
Well,

Unknown Speaker  1:09:31
you get your plan of action in place. Yeah, as as,

Unknown Speaker  1:09:36
as soon as Mark decides to pay for us to take off that day, I'll, I'll give in the adoring until then,

Unknown Speaker  1:09:49
till then.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:52
Sheet,

Unknown Speaker  1:09:54
all right, so that till then, perfectly fine. Let's, let's make it happen. Sweet. I like it.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:00
What are we talking about again, though,

Unknown Speaker  1:10:04
dealer commissions and the fun part of, how do we,

Unknown Speaker  1:10:09
how elaborate do we get to a cardboard so

Unknown Speaker  1:10:17
well Mark and I already figured this out, so you just kind of like it. Matthias, thighs.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:25
Just kidding.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:32
Cool,

Unknown Speaker  1:10:35
good.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:37
Thanks. Wayne, I think that

Unknown Speaker  1:10:41
gives us what we need from you. Good.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:45
All right. Well, since, since I'm not invited to hang around and stay hang out with the cool kids, I will get back to work, you know.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:57
All right,

Unknown Speaker  1:10:59
okay, um, one other little paper cut item that I didn't get on my list and just thought of, is the on the assets, the date of service is required to have a date in order to save the asset, but you can't add anything to it unless it is prior to the date of service,

Unknown Speaker  1:11:20
so it forces you to just pick a date of service out there, you know, sometime.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:30
So I think the prior to the date of putting it in service is correct as far as from a methodology standpoint. You know, once it's in service, you should be considering them as expenses, not as asset costs,

Unknown Speaker  1:11:47
but you should be able to save it without putting in a data service. I believe.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:55
Yeah, I think

Unknown Speaker  1:11:58
so. So the like a real life scenario, is one company that bought a paint system, so we need to create that asset, but we don't put it in service until we you know there's probably going to be some labor and some other miscellaneous invoices tied to it. We need to create the asset so we can link those

Unknown Speaker  1:12:19
to that asset and then put it in service. It's relatable.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:26
I think

Unknown Speaker  1:12:28
it's reasonable Seth I would make, make date put in service be required if it's sold or abandoned.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:37
I

Unknown Speaker  1:12:43
or I can, I can shoot you an email so you got to

Unknown Speaker  1:12:50
know.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:52
Sorry.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:54
What's nice if everything comes to one place? Yep, I Okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:13:03
that's great.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:11
Yep. All right.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:13
None less, we want to talk about the payments. Well, I think we might as well. We've got 15 minutes, and if it's okay with you, we'll just,

Unknown Speaker  1:13:20
later today sent you, well, reprioritize, or prioritize what we cover, send it to you and then, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:13:31
go ahead Drew, but you have a payment. Um, so on vendor invoices, we can only make one payment.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:40
And we've talked about this before and everything, but we've had a number of either because of our incorrect entry or because of vendors changing things on an invoice, just simply needing to make edits to vendor invoices. So there's we've paid one portion, and now they're coming, and it's saying, no, it's actually another $350

Unknown Speaker  1:14:05
so what we have to do now is create a new invoice with the same number for those $350 and then we pay that. So we have two invoices now that need to be held together

Unknown Speaker  1:14:21
to do to match what the vendor has is what we are to so, you know, we might have paid $2,000 on it. And I was saying, no, it's actually 2250, so we created $250 invoice, and then we pay that one,

Unknown Speaker  1:14:38
um, all with the same number, so that it correctly goes through saying we're paying this for them.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:46
How much, how structurally, what are we getting into if we would try to make so that multiple payments can be made, so that,

Unknown Speaker  1:14:57
you know, I mean, especially, this would be more.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:00
Handy when there's POS involved, because in

Unknown Speaker  1:15:04
order to correctly reflect the PO, you have to put it all on the same vendor invoice. So you have to create a negative non PO line and so on and so forth.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:13
But that way, if we come back, we say, Oh, actually, this vendor invoice is supposed to be another $250 we can just edit the total on the invoice, and it says, Hey, you already paid the 2000

Unknown Speaker  1:15:27
there is now due $250

Unknown Speaker  1:15:30
on this funding.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:32
Now, is that a big, huge project, or

Unknown Speaker  1:15:36
small? Or what are we that? Well,

Unknown Speaker  1:15:41
I think it's a Josh question.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:44
If my hands were tied and I couldn't do any development, here's what I would tell you to do. You

Unknown Speaker  1:15:51
get your $2,000 invoice. You pay it. You get the $250

Unknown Speaker  1:15:56
in.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:58
You

Unknown Speaker  1:16:01
create a $250

Unknown Speaker  1:16:04
vendor invoice.

Unknown Speaker  1:16:09
You pay it, and you create a credit,

Unknown Speaker  1:16:15
and you take that credit, you apply it to the original invoice in the amount of $250

Unknown Speaker  1:16:22
and you adjust the original vendor invoice total all the PO amounts, and you keep the payment amount

Unknown Speaker  1:16:29
so So you basically, so is it a weird trail? Yes,

Unknown Speaker  1:16:35
but you can at least now correctly calculate po values. Now the you are right that the correct long term solution is multiple payments on a vendor invoice.

Unknown Speaker  1:16:50
That's a Josh question. Maybe a dev priorities discussion, I don't really know.

Unknown Speaker  1:16:57
And currently, the only way to have all the payments is with with with credit memos and so,

Unknown Speaker  1:17:03
yeah, yeah, I would do that with if it happens, if it happens

Unknown Speaker  1:17:08
every week, then we should take a look at it. If it happens once every quarter,

Unknown Speaker  1:17:12
then I think this is an acceptable solution. And you can, you can pull them in your invoice for the full total and trace down good.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:22
I had several this past week. Now that's not there's not several every week. What I am doing is

Unknown Speaker  1:17:32
the original vendor invoice that we paid. I changed it to a non Po.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:40
Okay, unhook the PO, change it to non Po, then the new correct one. I connect the PO for the proper amount, and then I write a negative non PO line for the amount of the original vendor invoice, right? So, and then you still have to link those two invoices together.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:05
You know that works.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:10
I mean, the nice thing is, with the new short links, you

Unknown Speaker  1:18:13
can the thing about it is, if they send, you know, you have a discrepancy between what you say you owe, and what the vendor says you owe. And so they send you a statement, and we send the statement to AP, and they say, well, this doesn't make sense, because you have this ex vendor invoice for so and so much, you know, and we don't match like that's where I'm afraid the biggest glitches will come in if they know what they're looking at and know how how we do it, and how we sort through those things. You know,

Unknown Speaker  1:18:48
it can all work. So, yeah, so I guess it's just a priorities thing with Josh and but you're saying it would take a fundamental amount of work

Unknown Speaker  1:19:02
to make it happen.

Unknown Speaker  1:19:09
Well, I'm saying,

Unknown Speaker  1:19:11
if Josh,

Unknown Speaker  1:19:13
I'm saying, Well, let me I mean,

Unknown Speaker  1:19:17
yes, I am saying that.

Unknown Speaker  1:19:20
I

Unknown Speaker  1:19:22
i do think my approach is better than yours, because

Unknown Speaker  1:19:28
there's less compute, there's there's the your credit memo becomes,

Unknown Speaker  1:19:34
is like

Unknown Speaker  1:19:37
correct underpayment or something like that, right? But, yes, it is. It is that level and,

Unknown Speaker  1:19:49
yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:19:54
sorry,

Unknown Speaker  1:19:58
how often are we? I mean.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:00
The over the course of, let's say the last quarter. Are you seeing one every two weeks?

Unknown Speaker  1:20:14
I mean, I would say I'm probably seeing, you know, a dozen or so over the last quarter.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:22
Okay? That's

Unknown Speaker  1:20:24
expecting to

Unknown Speaker  1:20:27
get a few things mixed up, but you know, so now, does that come out to about

Unknown Speaker  1:20:33
one every two weeks? Yeah, something about once a week. Wow, yeah, but yeah. But then it's, you know, like, and there can be six weeks with nothing like it, and then you get four in the same week. Like, it's just

Unknown Speaker  1:20:49
about long there's but, yeah, there's definitely more times I would utilize it if the functionality was there

Unknown Speaker  1:21:00
just for other things. Like, if we had that functionality, all of that designer metal stuff, where she paid some with cash and some with this, like, for that too, it would, you know, and so that, hopefully we'll have that. But that was about 12 times in a day.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:17
Yeah, yeah. I mean that solution easy for that.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:26
Yeah, that's all I have. I think, okay, go take it up with Josh, see what he says, and we can go from there.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:34
Okay, so, yeah, that's all I had as well. So

Unknown Speaker  1:21:39
we'll send you an updated list and reprioritize and

Unknown Speaker  1:21:45
go from there. Okay, sounds good. Okay, thank you. Appreciate it.
