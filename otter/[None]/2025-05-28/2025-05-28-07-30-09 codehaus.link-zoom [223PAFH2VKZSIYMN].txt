Unknown Speaker  00:51
Hey guys, I'm free. So Morning,

Unknown Speaker  00:58
Morning, morning, doing

Unknown Speaker  01:02
it's not it's not half as cool as it sounds.

Matthias Miller  01:05
Okay, that's terrible. I am so unimpressed. Wayne, I retract my text. Well,

Speaker 1  01:12
I mean, okay, so essentially, a Google Sheet calls the services API, pulls in data, and then you point Looker studio to the to the data, and the only it's not real time, because they don't, the free versions don't allow for real time. So every 15 minutes, this thing refreshes, but still, it gives me a whole bunch of map bubbles and shows me exactly where every building is that I need

Matthias Miller  01:37
that's unscheduled. You're a funny man. Hey, listen, share your screen. Share it with us. Show us. Hold on a second. Oh, that's cool. Let me

Speaker 1  01:49
move this over here. I just got hacked off. I'm like, I need I need mapping. I need mapping. All right, I'm assuming everybody's on big screen, so

Matthias Miller  01:59
we're on big screens. Oh, Drew's here. Oh,

Unknown Speaker  02:07
no, I should, probably shouldn't take up time then, all right, I'm assuming you can see, I can never

Matthias Miller  02:14
tell Bucha that's loading now, yeah, well, I mean, now I can see your report.

Speaker 1  02:18
Okay, so up here on the top right hand corner is a map view. Yep. And when you click the map view, this is gonna take a little bit to look it always takes a bit to load. There

Matthias Miller  02:30
you go. What about a boom. And if

Speaker 1  02:31
you zoom in, it's like mouse on top of it will tell you exactly what

Matthias Miller  02:35
it is, Hall and it you can click on it, stand, everything like that. You can't

Speaker 1  02:38
really click on anything. It's just, it just cover pins and labels and so at least I can, you know, it's everything's color coded. You can say, oh, okay, so I got, you know, these deliveries up here. I got, you know, so when it's pouring down rain, like it's been for the last couple days, you got to rearrange, rearrange a bunch of things. You can be like, Okay, I got a bunch of, I got a couple law halls over here. Let's go, go handle those sweet, cool.

Unknown Speaker  03:07
You have something fancy like that for me?

Speaker 1  03:13
Well, if you, if, if you want to learn how to do it, it's, it's me and my friend, chat GPT, we will

Matthias Miller  03:21
chat. We'll show you. We'll give you a map of where your payables are going. Okay, check destinations. No,

Speaker 2  03:30
what I need is the map of the ones that are stuck in the mail. I need a ready to chat. GPT, to hack USPS for that.

Matthias Miller  03:44
Yeah, let's not get started on that. This. That's a rabbit hole right there.

Speaker 3  03:49
Yeah, I'm not sure they always know where their stuff is anyway, so hacking them might not do much good.

Matthias Miller  03:57
I have an envelope that has a yellow non deliverable mail sticker, and the date between the postmark and the non deliverable mail sticker is almost exactly a year.

Speaker 2  04:11
Well, his friend posted a picture. I don't know was that a job that he was working at or what? But anyway, there were three mailboxes that were blocked by a truck that was parked on the road in front of the mailboxes, and he couldn't deliver to the mailboxes, but he could get out of his delivery vehicle to put a note on The truck that it's blocking the mailboxes.

Matthias Miller  04:40
That's funny.

Speaker 2  04:42
What our work environment is coming to I guess you

Unknown Speaker  04:49
make a good developer, wouldn't it?

Matthias Miller  04:53
I think more like a tester. Here's what's wrong. Be what you did.

Speaker 4  05:11
Good so I see we have a new a new face on here this morning. I'm going to assume it's Seth's younger brother, but I don't

Matthias Miller  05:20
know. Okay, that could be

Speaker 5  05:22
a good guess. No, my name is Sean. I've, yeah, I've got an invite for this meeting and a few of the other ones before. And, yeah, I'm just doing a shadow. I'm not here to necessarily add anything of value. So you can, you pretty much just ignore me. I'll just be in the corner

Speaker 4  05:35
over here. Okay, I'm curious, what's your what's your role at COVID crafters,

Speaker 5  05:41
yes, my role, I'm in the new apprentice. So I'm very much in a learning phase right now. I'm doing a little bit of everything here and there, doing a lot of learning. Yeah, yeah. Mine, yeah. Obviously, my name is Sean Miller, as you can see in the Zoom bubble there. But yeah, I'm here to learn. That's what I'm here, here to do. Okay?

Unknown Speaker  06:02
Very well, you have good people learn from

Unknown Speaker  06:06
that. Is that is very true. I have discovered that very quickly. Thank

Unknown Speaker  06:09
you, Drew. I'll take that as a

Matthias Miller  06:13
compliment. He's like, why were you on the call before this? Sean, yeah,

Speaker 4  06:27
uh, how to deal with obnoxious clients, right? If that's what you meant, Wayne, that's what

Unknown Speaker  06:33
all in fun, all in fun.

Speaker 4  06:38
So is, is as a new apprentice who, who is, do multiple people teach, or is it like, do you have,

Speaker 5  06:49
yeah, I would say I like, it's from all the guys here in the office and you know other people you know, who work for Code writers in different states. It's every, everybody is, yeah, teaching me here and there as, yeah, as needed, as I, you know, need different experience from different fields. I would say, I think everyone, everyone here at cocoa, says, been my teacher at some point thus far. So,

Unknown Speaker  07:15
okay, yeah.

Speaker 3  07:17
Then once Nick is back from FB. I think he'll, he'll be doing a lot with Sean, right, okay, but for now, he's been working with, well, Tim and Ben writes a fair bit and but then also with everyone else in varying levels, right?

Speaker 4  07:37
Cool, good. Well, I send out an agenda. Should we? Yeah, anything before we jump in?

Matthias Miller  07:49
Matthias? Nothing here. So obviously,

Speaker 4  07:53
no meeting next week, meeting June, 12 and the 19th, just the normal time, and then off or no meetings the 23rd and the 30th. And we do have our dev priorities meeting coming up. Right? A Yeah, June 13, so review current projects. I think probably the best thing is just to Oh, okay, some of these shouldn't have been on here. I was, was didn't take enough time to prepare that first one. We can just ignore it. You're waiting on me. Seth for more information. There the split sales tax, use tax for Ohio. Matthias, I felt like there's not a lot of like. It seemed to me like most of what we covered a week ago was there's not much has changed. So we probably do a pretty short meeting. But is there anything so on any of these? If there's nothing, no new developments or questions, I think we just move on to the next one on the sales tax thing. Or is there anything I think you wrote up the changes that needed to be done. But is there anything more?

Matthias Miller  09:16
Seth, did have some questions? I don't know

Speaker 3  09:18
if these need to be covered. I made the change that Matthias wanted. I was just still confused on what problems you were seeing, because, yeah,

Speaker 2  09:31
did you get those that sorted out? Seth, on your questions,

Speaker 3  09:35
not really, I made the change Matthias said to make, but I still didn't fully understand why what you were saying.

Unknown Speaker  09:45
Okay, I should

Matthias Miller  09:47
was Drew's email before or after your fix,

Unknown Speaker  09:52
which,

Unknown Speaker  09:57
this last just yesterday. I.

Unknown Speaker  10:02
You sent an email yesterday.

Speaker 2  10:03
No. Matthias sent an email saying, Seth, I believe Bruce issue will be addressed by my comment here,

Speaker 3  10:12
yeah, so I made the change that he had in that comment. Okay, just yesterday,

Matthias Miller  10:20
yeah. But then Seth, you did have a question, when you file Sales and Use Tax separately for the same period, do you do you pay them in a single transaction or separate transactions?

Speaker 2  10:32
It would still be separate transactions, even if it's like you said it's a it's Same time, same ending, but different period lengths. What you were saying that's, that's going to be totally separate transactions. Okay,

Speaker 3  10:53
I don't think we don't have a way to split that apart right now. Okay, is that right? Matthias, I'm pretty sure,

Unknown Speaker  11:02
yeah, I think so. So I

Speaker 3  11:04
think basically we just get all the when you run either of the reports, we get you the list of end dates and then remove duplicates. And just so we can change that, we could have a more we could more explicitly match on Use Tax I guess,

Unknown Speaker  11:30
Row Type

Matthias Miller  11:35
in the instead of merely filtering, calculate liabilities, is that

Speaker 4  11:45
what we have to do currently, if you can't split the transaction like, put it into accounts payable and then, well,

Speaker 2  11:51
um, what I was noticing currently is that It's not like for use tax in April since, since it's set that it's quarterly and it ends on normal quarter. When I ran sales tax, it didn't process the use tax items at all. It didn't create a history for the April ones. When I did April sales tax, it didn't process any grading history for the April use tax items. So what's the period? Which is fine, the period is second quarter that we'd be in, that April would be in. So

Speaker 3  12:32
okay, yeah, no, we won't. We won't file it until you select the end Period, end date, right?

Speaker 2  12:38
But what was it two years ago? Would when we, when we run that June, what would happen then

Unknown Speaker  12:55
it would grab all the use tax that needed to be filed

Speaker 2  12:58
for the whole quarter. Yeah, and sales tax for the

Unknown Speaker  13:05
last for the month, yeah, and

Speaker 2  13:07
then it would just generate one transaction for everything.

Unknown Speaker  13:12
That's how it work right now. Yeah, yeah,

Speaker 2  13:15
okay. I mean I can, I can make that work, because I can just edit that transaction into two payments instead of one, you know, for the time being, and we'll just have, I'll just have to add a line for the bank and and split it.

Unknown Speaker  13:32
But, yeah,

Matthias Miller  13:34
but why wouldn't we just prompt with creating the transaction, whether you want to create the use tax? That's a little nuanced. I

Speaker 3  13:42
mean, could we just say if you report use tax separately, then we always create a separate transaction for use tax.

Speaker 4  13:54
Does that work for me? Does that apply for all states where we do use tags or do do some if you pay some as one transaction, if

Speaker 2  14:03
we report as a different period, then I think that would be the case. But if it's, there's, there's some states, quite a few, actually, that use taxes. You, you you state it separately.

Speaker 3  14:19
Oh, but you still pay, it's the same

Speaker 2  14:23
period, and you still pay it all in the same transaction. So Ohio is a different period. It's just entirely different. So,

Speaker 4  14:31
so you're saying if, in the case of Ohio, use tax paid quarterly, sales tax monthly, or if that's the case, then split it split transactions Otherwise, otherwise,

Speaker 2  14:43
keep it as one transaction. So if it's use tax and sales tax reported separately but both on the same monthly schedule, then just keep it as one transaction.

Speaker 3  14:57
I wonder if we just want to. Explicitly field it on the sales tax vendor. Or do we just say if that might be the best,

Unknown Speaker  15:08
I don't know,

Speaker 3  15:11
flexibility for what we're doing right now is, or how we feel right now is, if the if we report use tax separately, then we require a use tax filing period and month. So we could theoretically say, if that's the same as it is for sales tax, then we'll just lump them together every time for the transaction, assume that that's the payment you want. Otherwise we break it out. Or we could just add a check box that if we report use tax separately, well, then do we also need to create a separate transaction? I think

Speaker 2  15:50
that would probably be the best. I mean, I don't know if they'll get Nexus anywhere anytime soon, but if they do, it's, you know, in a different state, they probably do things differently. So if we got 46 more states to go or something that could be

Unknown Speaker  16:09
Matthias, what do you think?

Matthias Miller  16:15
Okay, so, is there any any point in the horizon in the next 12 months where we're going to report on the same period but create separate payment transactions.

Speaker 3  16:31
No, I think he's saying in well, weren't you saying in June for Ohio? Well,

Matthias Miller  16:35
except for Ohio. I mean, except in Ohio, except we already do. I mean, why not just even simple, if we have separate filing periods for for sales and use tax, then we create separate transactions. And at the point that you get to a state that requires some different configuration, like, yeah, in the words my high school teacher, let's cross that bridge until we get there, that's

Unknown Speaker  16:56
just because he was trying to end glass. Is

Unknown Speaker  17:01
that how you did Drew? DREW used to be a teacher, so, yeah,

Speaker 1  17:09
I'm assuming you miss said that on purpose, right? Yeah, okay. I was, it was, it was messing with my head. It's meant to

Speaker 3  17:22
I think the individual who has said that before is saying in all sincerity, without quite realizing

Matthias Miller  17:30
that is true, the original source is actually probably my classmates that were I phrased the most. Yeah, you get to be my age. Details get fuzzy,

Speaker 3  17:44
all right. I mean, I know who's the one that says it, yeah, fair enough. Yes.

Matthias Miller  17:50
Good. I would, I would. I would avoid, like, let's not over engineer this. I think it makes sense separate payment transactions. I

Speaker 3  18:00
mean, if you, is there, sorry, go ahead. Mark, no, go ahead. I was gonna say, is there a difference between reporting separately and filing separately? Isn't there? Because right now, what? Well, the checkbox we have for reporting separately breaks it out when we run the when we run the filing report. So maybe that is filing.

Speaker 2  18:28
In the case of Ohio with different time periods we are I have to file it separately, like on that side within the software. I don't know that makes a difference, but over there, I file it separate, I transact it separate, and everything, every other state that we're involved with Currently, there are some that I need it reported separately so that I can just mark it. But it's all the same filing and it's all the same transaction, and I believe those are all the same time period as well.

Speaker 3  19:08
So that's what I was that's what I was getting at like Matthias. Is it actually simpler to infer from the filing periods, or is it better to just field it separately? Yeah, yeah.

Matthias Miller  19:24
Well, really, what needs to happen? Okay, well, so why not I get what you're saying?

Matthias Miller  19:40
Are we basically saying that we need another checkbox called file, use tag separately that require you to set this?

Speaker 3  19:48
That's what I'm thinking. And if you report use text separately, then that checkbox would be visible, but it would not default to check, and then we would only check it for Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  20:00
Ohio, yes.

Unknown Speaker  20:03
And so that would just mean that, that we create a separate transaction,

Matthias Miller  20:12
right? And at that point you are literally filing it separately. It's very logical that you would have a separate transaction.

Speaker 3  20:21
I like, does the current? Does the current? Can you open the filing Report from the menu?

Unknown Speaker  20:29
I thought it was,

Unknown Speaker  20:32
yeah, yeah, that guy,

Speaker 2  20:35
I'm a little worried that, were we a separate report to open, or would you just,

Speaker 3  20:40
that's what I that was my next question. Do we run this once for use tax? Like if we it, just see now our our check boxes are going to be confusing, I think because we have a check box that says report, use tax separately, which breaks it apart in the filing report, and then we have a check box that says file, use tag separately, which breaks it apart in the transaction into different transactions. That's a little confusing.

Matthias Miller  21:07
But if we would say, Okay, I mean, if you want to clarify it, you can also change it to drop list use tax filing with sales tax are separate. But the other thing too, then on this report is is any filing report should prompt for use tax versus sales tax, if the vendor, you could have a conditionally visible prompt based on the vendor, where, if it's if it's Ohio treasure of state, it requires you to specify whether it's sales or use

Unknown Speaker  21:42
tax. So

Speaker 4  21:50
how much work are we? Does this look like Seth, because I'm just trying to weigh is it? Is it actually worth it to do this for one stage, four times a year like it, yeah, working with what you have now Drew is going to what add? Like, how much time would it add on to

Unknown Speaker  22:10
say, not a lot. Or

Unknown Speaker  22:13
is it more a matter of confusion?

Speaker 2  22:18
Yeah, I would say it's probably more a matter of, you know, it's several more bullet points explaining how this is supposed to work. You know,

Speaker 4  22:27
that's I'm just trying to figure out, is like, How much is it worth the compliment versus what it costs? So what are you thinking? Seth, is it or Matthias these changes to make it, to make these changes.

Unknown Speaker  22:48
I mean, how we're currently proposing is several hours.

Speaker 4  22:52
Well, then I'd say, Let's Yeah, just do it.

Speaker 4  23:02
Unless you guys disagree, unless you feel it's, it's over engineering something.

Matthias Miller  23:07
Wait, I think it. I think it. I mean the one reason for two reasons for doing it. Number one, this more closely models reality. We are thinking, we are thinking about reporting versus filing separately.

Matthias Miller  23:26
So that's my argument for. The other argument for is reducing like I feel like this will it brings clarity, not just to true, but it brings clarity throughout the entire process. I don't know, like, like, if you like, at least an incremental improvement in maintainability. The argument against is, or the wild crazy, probably a terrible idea again, because it doesn't model. Reality is, could we have different vendors for sales tax and use tax within the same district.

Unknown Speaker  24:10
Like basically just re spell it, yeah. I mean, you

Matthias Miller  24:13
would have Ohio treasurer of state sales tax, Ohio Treasurer state use tax, and you would use the payee to wherever that is, to stomp over the

Speaker 2  24:27
Well, I mean, that could work because, well, how does it? We still

Matthias Miller  24:37
didn't need to differentiate whether sales tax vendor is a is it for sales tax? Is it for use tax, or is it for

Speaker 4  24:50
both? Mission, please go ahead and make these changes. Is because I see is also especially high using the use tax thing more because we're going to. Yeah, but at some point, I think we're going to take advantage of these bill on site buildings where we we're currently charging the customer sales tax. So the entire ticket, like the 750 1000 were, it's, it's perfectly fine to we pay the use tax on the materials and then either increase our margins or pass that savings on the cost of it. So I see it's used before, so I think it's the right thing

Speaker 2  25:40
that reminds me to talk about use tags for Louisiana's buildings for the

Unknown Speaker  25:47
comfortable

Unknown Speaker  25:51
with this Bridge.

Matthias Miller  25:58
Go ahead.

Speaker 3  26:01
I'm still just a little bit leery about how we're okay. I think the design is reasonable. I'm a little leery about how we're labeling it. It's just going

Unknown Speaker  26:12
to feel confusing.

Unknown Speaker  26:16
I'm not quite sure how to do it

Unknown Speaker  26:17
differently. Yeah.

Speaker 3  26:22
Is it intuitive that checking the file use tax separately check box doesn't change anything in the sales tax filing report? Well, not true. It does actually, because then we would require the Ask prompt for sales versus use tax. No, I think it's reasonable.

Speaker 2  26:41
Could you label it, file and pay use tax separately, or something like that?

Matthias Miller  26:47
It could be you could also do something like this, so bad debt, where you say, file with with sales tax or

Speaker 3  27:08
bad debt. Or one is report with sales tax, one is lump it, or

Matthias Miller  27:14
bad debt, treat, treat as well. Or, I mean, really, do you want to? I mean, it's really a bad like, do you here? Let's, let's jump down to excuse tax. Here's what I'm thinking with you. Stacks use tax.

Unknown Speaker  27:37
She does

Matthias Miller  27:40
file and or with a file and report as sales tax, file with sales tax and but report separately and file separately. I mean, that's really confusing. I mean, that's proposed.

Speaker 3  28:03
I mean, that's clear. That's what we're doing with the that's what we would be doing with the check boxes

Matthias Miller  28:10
and then the bad debt. You're basically saying, Do you treat this as a just with, with, with,

Speaker 4  28:22
what? Why? Where does bad debt come into this conversation? Because

Speaker 3  28:26
we have a report separately for bad debt. Oh, and so, if we change how use tax functions, and it gets a little confusing with bad debt, potentially,

Matthias Miller  28:41
so what if we would just say use tax filing, or what if we would actually make file with file use tax separately the primary check box?

Unknown Speaker  28:54
But

Unknown Speaker  28:57
what does that mean? Then

Matthias Miller  28:59
that means you literally file it separately, okay? And if it's unchecked, then you say, then you can't, then it can get I mean reporting only makes sense, or use tax becomes a drop list.

Speaker 3  29:21
What if use tax is just a drop list that's defaults to use tax filing defaults to with sales tax, but then you can also report separately or file separately. I mean, that's essentially what you were saying it's just

Matthias Miller  29:42
trimming down the wording. Maybe we want the verbose. Okay, sorry, you're just exhibit use tax you have

Matthias Miller  29:58
report separately, uh. Treat as so when we lump this in, do we just literally treat this as taxable revenue?

Speaker 2  30:18
I think so. I mean, if you, if you literally put it all together, it would just there would see no difference between sales and use. And it's, yeah,

Matthias Miller  30:36
what's this? This one file is sales use tax combined with sales,

Speaker 3  30:49
and we could probably leave bad debt just as a checkbox. I don't think it'd be too ridiculous.

Speaker 2  31:01
Make the could you say the file separately? Say file and pay separately. I mean, I don't know what it's supposed to be, but

Speaker 3  31:13
so if it's file and pay separately, should the other one be file separately?

Speaker 2  31:20
Because if you're if you're doing a total separate filing, you're going to do a separate transaction as well, whereas the report is just

Unknown Speaker  31:32
breaking it out in our filing report.

Unknown Speaker  31:36
Yeah,

Speaker 3  31:39
so it's the same filing, but it's,

Speaker 2  31:44
what about using visibility separately, or something like that?

Matthias Miller  31:54
I don't know you're good at cutting through the noise. What are your What are your thoughts? I

Speaker 1  32:12
i That's a that I hate to admit this there was that I was completely tuned out.

Matthias Miller  32:19
I know how passionate you are about use tax, so

Unknown Speaker  32:24
I shot

Speaker 1  32:28
it's like the day that we we built sales tax module, and it got transferred to Drew I cease to care.

Matthias Miller  32:37
That's fine. I'm like, party

Unknown Speaker  32:39
with it.

Speaker 1  32:41
So I'm sorry if you want my if you want my opinion, you're gonna have to go back and probably re explain some things which would create more noise. I was trying to figure out why dog kennel is not pricing correctly, so I um,

Unknown Speaker  33:03
probably not calculating in tax.

Speaker 1  33:05
Well, somebody, somebody removed a price per size and it has my name on it. That must be my responsibility. Weird, I know

Matthias Miller  33:19
stupid activity history. Well, as

Speaker 1  33:22
I, as I lamented to Ellis one day, I said, there is one pick that I have with the software. If you could solve it, it would be really, really nice. Modification history will tell me what happened. It just never tells me why it happened, so you can get the why. That'd be really nice.

Matthias Miller  33:40
Well, well, we'll have a an event on save. Why are you doing this?

Speaker 1  33:48
Well, I think we need something better than that, some sort of AI that activates your camera looks at you and, you know, it determines your mood and and, you know, thought process. I don't know if you're gonna, if you're gonna do, if you're gonna activate some sort of change on change box to input data. You know what, exactly what's going to happen. People are going to skip it, and if you make it, if you make it required, then people get annoyed.

Matthias Miller  34:13
So you can have, if you, if you have neural link recording all of your thoughts, and you just basically rewind back in that space and say, All right, let me explore the context of what was going on, like 15 minutes before and after. Oh, I was just mad at you know, I don't know what. Just kidding. Okay, so I

Unknown Speaker  34:54
Okay, well,

Unknown Speaker  34:57
and then file and pay separately or I. Right?

Unknown Speaker  35:04
Which one do you?

Speaker 2  35:09
Do you report? Do you group them with sales tax as a default, and then we would just have under the report roofing, say, use tax, separate bad debt, separate something like that, and if one or both or neither are checked, then you create the regular sales tax report accordingly.

Matthias Miller  35:52
I

Unknown Speaker  35:56
you're not convinced these are the same drop list.

Speaker 4  36:01
Well, is it? What if we believe this in Matthias And Seth, I think you know what we want for the end result. What if you Yes, get your heads together, or just Yeah, sounds good. I guess we trust Yeah.

Matthias Miller  36:12
We're at the point of diminishing returns here. Like you could flip a coin and whatever. Seth, I'm I'm fine with I like my last Rename, and I'm fine taking this direction.

Unknown Speaker  36:28
Good

Speaker 4  36:31
anything on revised actual cost application since we talked last class,

Matthias Miller  36:37
Seth and I are planning to work on that sometime this week, Friday.

Speaker 4  36:42
And just a note on that, Josh is going to reach out to you regarding,

Speaker 4  36:53
okay, so we he, he's going to make so that we can link a purchase order or a vendor invoice, basically say this vendor invoice or this purchase order should be tied to this specific stin. So the use case for that actually just, just, why don't you just open the incident? It's the, I don't have the incident number, but it's, it's bomb build out with assigned to Josh and just share that, and then we can it's on there. Yeah, that one.

Unknown Speaker  37:31
It's down.

Unknown Speaker  37:33
Yeah, that one. So what does this do to accounting? So the thought is that this would always be raw materials in raw materials, production, overhead and production, labor,

Speaker 4  37:57
GL account, one of those which are posted onto the balance sheet, and then at the point where, like it would just assign a so some case in point here is we place an order on a custom building. We place an order for trusses specifically for that building, or a lumber package or a metal package that's, it's non we don't have skew, we don't have standard SKUs for it. So we place a a custom order for that, and then on the purchase order, typically on the purchase order, but it could also go in the vendor invoice. We say this is to be tied to this skin. So if the purchase order has a value of, say, $5,000 then it will increase the the raw materials value by $5,000 I mean, Josh is he seems to be pretty clear on how he's wanting to handle this. Does this have any accounting implications that you can think of, I guess? Well, okay, that's the first question.

Matthias Miller  39:14
Well, as long as, I mean, as long as nobody does anything crazy, like, since the you have a PO for office supplies, and they tie it to a building,

Speaker 1  39:26
blonde dyke bars start playing Klondike,

Matthias Miller  39:30
yeah, why don't? I don't care what's on the order, you can have contact bars for your for your shed. That's fine. It just needs to go to the building of the raw materials, ledger account. Not quite sure how that's going to work. But what's special about your sheds? There's just something special

Unknown Speaker  39:50
built and powered by Klondike bars.

Matthias Miller  39:57
But But fundamentally that. Doesn't matter. The main interesting thing about it, I think, is that on building costing, if you have the PO, you receive it, you get invoiced across the month end period, then you're going to have a potential, and there's freight included, you're going to have a discrepancy. And I'm assuming you're just going to have to throw up your hands and say, whoops, that was wrong.

Speaker 4  40:27
So I think on this, I mean, it sounds like it's something we should just get started with it and then see and then deal with things that address things that like cross the bridge when we get there. Does that sound fair to you? It does

Matthias Miller  40:42
it also sounds to me a little bit like you guys are already light years ahead of everybody else, and Larry, if I had to channel what I would guess, Larry to say, it's like better is better than perfect. And where you guys are at with this is light years ahead of

Speaker 4  41:03
anyway. So the other thing Josh is going to reach out to you, just to know down towards the second last group there, the one that's unchecked, think through POS with non inventory skews and tiny Josh said he'll reach out to you. So just an FYI on that, so

Matthias Miller  41:23
inventory SKUs, okay, so should we go ahead and, I mean, there's no reason why we shouldn't go get basic costing, just based on the on the bomb stuff we have now in tie in po and vendor invoice costs later, right?

Speaker 4  41:44
Yeah, correct. I mean, what Josh is planning to do is actually break down, okay, if he has a PO specifically for tied to a specific extent, is to not just bring in the PO, but to actually break down the line items of that po on the bill of materials list, and just denote which are, you have items coming out of inventory, and then you have items on a designated purchase order broken down. So I think doing that will, I mean, I think that. So so what that means, I think, is you'll use that bill of materials, total value, to do your actual cost application, just like we discussed. I think, right. So, I guess only applying actual cost is there. Is there something we should look at today in that on that or not. No, we need

Matthias Miller  42:43
to tear into it good, just for sake of example. What is an example? Not to take too much time, but what's, what's an example of a non inventory SKU that's just any skew like, normally, you don't, you don't stock somebody wants a big picture window in their shed, you don't stock them and so, but you order it from your supplier and it gets put in the building. Is that the kind of thing?

Speaker 4  43:10
Well, every SKU is designated, whether it's an inventory item or not, like Klondike bars or Gatorade or not, and then actually materials are. So I'm not sure that we even, since I'm actually not sure what a realistic example with, yeah, I'll check it out about this team would be, honestly, I'd say, just discuss with Josh. And if, yeah, if, okay, we need more examples than we can get, alright? So sales order updates to make the so Josh has now done his piece on that. So I think what's remaining on that project is I need to provide you with a marked up example of what we want that PDF to look like. And then the thought was that you're going to take that to code crafters and have them do that. So I think that's just an FYI

Matthias Miller  44:13
that's not that's not super high, like urgent, no, it's okay. So that'd be a good one to bump to downstream. Hand off to something

Speaker 4  44:33
else. Yeah, good. The true on ACH payments, you had something you're needing something moral. True is, no, that's for the positive. Okay, so the ACH payments,

Unknown Speaker  44:45
yeah, nothing there that I know of, hey,

Speaker 4  44:54
nine, nothing on that, Joshua on that first 10. Um. Yeah, I saw your note on that set. So I think that's just nothing to do on that until and then, yeah, the last one reporting discrepancies. That one's go ahead too. I think you just created that one and just Yeah.

Speaker 2  45:14
So I've been working on trying to get the balance sheet and reports sounds good as of the same date as my balance sheet to match yeah on these asset accounts and there, there's lots of things all over the place on them. So incident, what number was? It has no it's not assigned to anybody. Reporting discrepancies? 676, yeah, that's hesitant. Yeah. So here's this one. I think you commented on an email about this mismatch. I think it's the one that was it in 23 or something. Yeah. Um, I can do little foggy on the details of what that thing was, but like

Speaker 2  46:16
we took off, basically our reports should also explore exclude, like, if the item's not going to be on the mismatch thing, because it's in 23 of them. Our portion also, well, still across the board, though, right? How did

Speaker 4  46:34
you discover this? One was this when you were auditing balance sheet of Commons? Yeah.

Speaker 2  46:40
So it got changed and it thanks. It should have kicked a mismatch. I mean, like it doesn't mismatch, it doesn't match, because it's a 20 something got edited into something 23 but

Speaker 4  46:56
why? Why are they making a change? Why was it changing? It was 25 on a 23

Speaker 2  47:03
it's something to do with the building. I think they removed a discount or something. I mean, it's not, it's not something that should have been done anyway.

Matthias Miller  47:17
So I guess one of the ways we could handle this is in historical periods, for the purposes of mismatch tracking, we could capture everything within yesterday, everything within from the accounting impact start date, and then also look at all transactions and records that are referenced that any accounting impact records that occurred prior to that, and include that in the mismatch. I think that's saying, Actually, okay, um, we can explore and see what it takes.

Speaker 2  47:57
Another thing on this one, it was

Speaker 6  48:11
okay. And as far as availability, we have left the black panel that it's almost same. I i

Speaker 6  48:27
But it's the same that applies. I

Matthias Miller  48:32
wonder if we could assume

Speaker 6  48:35
it's probably the time, you could check those fairly directly with the site measurements. Okay, now I'll check it

Matthias Miller  48:48
out. That's actually the only thing we can do, because we don't know, find all accounting impact transactions prior to the counting impacts our date expanded out to source record type slash IDs, use Those basis okay

Speaker 2  49:20
on this item. So the building was removed, but we have that. We have the itemization. And there must have been a discount for this $394 is under six cents. So the way to actually fix this thing is to say, No, we actually offered and put the discount back in, but when I went to do that, it took away the itemization.

Matthias Miller  49:48
Yeah, well, disconnecting it from the building also has historical has historical accounting impact implications, like you're building now, like, right? You. Uh, sales costing is messed up, or COGS is messed up from the building side, right?

Speaker 2  50:05
And those need disconnected. Well, I don't know if they do on this particular building or not, but like when they disconnect a building from an invoice, they have to disconnect the sales transactions that went along with that invoice from it so that they stay as they are, and then and then they can go ahead and disconnect the building.

Matthias Miller  50:27
Right now, your building has a has an accounting discrepancy,

Speaker 2  50:36
yeah, but it will write a new one when you hook it up to a new invoice, won't it?

Matthias Miller  50:42
Right, but we still have the old transaction in 2023 for the building that now doesn't match what the building wants to generate for 2025

Unknown Speaker  50:53
Yeah, you have to unhook it

Matthias Miller  50:57
like but you're not gonna go back and void the cogs transit, are you? No,

Speaker 2  51:02
no, you're not going to avoid it. You have to say this, this transaction no longer is the invoicing transaction for this building. It's fair enough. It's just a transaction that happened. Yeah, fair enough. We've been writing, or, supposedly, anyway, putting, you know, like a memo link that this was for the invoice and for this building on it got it first time around, right, right,

Matthias Miller  51:26
right, all right.

Speaker 2  51:30
Yeah, the way we found that was by locking prior periods and then stuff that doesn't match. Like, Oh, this isn't going to work anyway. So is there a way to put to keep this itemization and put this discount back in?

Matthias Miller  51:55
Dwayne says, No, but Why could we there's no world in which we can do treat this as a write off,

Speaker 2  52:04
yeah, but we can't post it back to that. Like, yeah, I thought of that too, but I can't, I can't write the transaction. Then

Matthias Miller  52:11
I can, okay. I mean, I like, how often is this? Does this type of thing happen? And is this going to happen a lot, moving, I mean, building fixing, building fixing, building retrieval is going to get rid of this, right? I hope so. I hope so too. I mean, I think the answer will no longer do retrievals selling.

Speaker 4  52:30
Dwayne's going to start, have to start his own company,

Unknown Speaker  52:36
zero retrievals, RTO company,

Speaker 4  52:40
wow, solving all your customer accounting and other difficulties,

Speaker 1  52:47
Matthias and I are cooking up this idea that any retrieve will happen gets sold before we actually pick it up.

Speaker 4  52:53
There you go. We offer steep discount if the customer makes it up himself, that would be, imagine this customer rolling in to pick up a shed, heavily discounted.

Unknown Speaker  53:10
The guy knew to get it here. Yes, the

Unknown Speaker  53:13
guy comes out with a gun. This

Speaker 1  53:17
is, this is a great business model. Some rando shows up in your front yard, yanking your building,

Matthias Miller  53:22
and then you turn into a TV show, and that's where the real guy is. But this reminds me of gabe's famous, famous building delivery story, where this building was held together by tread nails, and they wanted it moved, and they got, like, an eighth mile down the road, and it collapses into neighbor's yard, and the neighbor smiled and says, Oh, I wanted some lumber anyway.

Matthias Miller  53:57
All right, this would be underpayment, and I guess this would have to be negative, no overpayment over Wait, but

Speaker 2  54:06
that's going to oh, that's going to report differently.

Matthias Miller  54:11
It is. So I'll need to Oh, but then these are locked periods. That's the fun thing, right? But I'll push, but then I can push the the payment and the sales were invoiced. Well, right?

Speaker 2  54:29
But that needs to hit. That needs to hit the discount account. There needed to be another journal entry to move it from customer overpayments to the discount account,

Matthias Miller  54:42
right?

Speaker 2  54:45
Which I can write that journal, I'm sure, because it wouldn't be connected to the end of sales.

Matthias Miller  54:48
Okay, so for this one, thiais pushes two to three

Unknown Speaker  54:57
months out of.

Unknown Speaker  55:00
Well So

Matthias Miller  55:02
Matthias teaches push petite while teaches Seth how to push these. Pushes, new overpayment, Drew adds, journal entry, moving from overpayment,

Unknown Speaker  55:22
payment to discount.

Matthias Miller  55:26
Okay, well, that's a taking a machine gun to a Robin, Sparrow, but Sparrow, let's say, but it works.

Speaker 2  55:34
Feathers. The rest of these, basically, I was just creating a list of there's items in there that we should just look at and say, why did this not show up on the report, but showed up In accounting or vice versa?

Matthias Miller  55:50
Okay? So cancel order. I

Unknown Speaker  56:03
so we just look up that sales order,

Matthias Miller  56:10
and then this is the so you would expect this sales order. So as a balance due, you would expect it to show up in the AR report. And

Unknown Speaker  56:22
dates are correct.

Matthias Miller  56:25
Um, as of 127 for North Carolina. This is but this is canceled so, but

Speaker 2  56:35
so like on 316 it should be on the AR report, because it was canceled on 17.

Matthias Miller  56:43
We need to respect cancelation date. So basically and, and so, and is NA so cancel cancelation date or so cancelation date is greater than be ask as update set, does that look great?

Unknown Speaker  57:08
Yeah, I think so. Straight off, that's,

Matthias Miller  57:18
that's what you were thinking. That's what you're gonna 3298 okay, but it's still not, well, okay. But this is, this seems to be, this, at least, seems to be an issue. But let's go into the subset, then now let's just find out, okay, district, we know should, well actually, let's sign the ask as update equals. What are we running as of 127,

Matthias Miller  58:01
type is district X load balance we don't have we're not filtering by dealers.

Unknown Speaker  58:12
So Well, let's go

Matthias Miller  58:16
look at cancelation cancellates 320 Okay, now that's that falls cancelation date and invoice date. Okay, but this was canceled. This was an invoice until the third and so it's not so we can fix the cancelation thing. But now the reason it's not showing on the report was because it was invoiced on the third, so it's only going to be on AR from the third to the 17th.

Speaker 2  58:39
Right, right. That's one. That's it should be showing up there if you have a AR report as of date in between. Okay, let's

Matthias Miller  58:48
do three, three with this new subset. And there it is. Yeah. Then we have, we're going to do 316 day before cancelation.

Speaker 6  59:04
We didn't get them yet, and we don't have anyways for that. You have three.

Matthias Miller  59:14
Why is it not?

Unknown Speaker  59:16
Oh, um, there was a payment.

Matthias Miller  59:20
There's an adjustment on the 13th, okay,

Unknown Speaker  59:23
well, there's a payment,

Matthias Miller  59:27
right? It was a zero balance as of the 13th. Then when they canceled it, yeah,

Speaker 2  59:36
then they brought that balance back, got it

Unknown Speaker  59:42
Okay,

Unknown Speaker  59:45
so that would be correct.

Matthias Miller  59:50
So we should, so we should see it on the 12th, yeah, and then we should not see it on the 13th. So. Wrote that off.

Matthias Miller  1:00:07
Now it does mean that if you, if you cancel it, and nobody does or runs a refund, it doesn't, it still doesn't show on the AR report.

Speaker 2  1:00:26
And nobody does so it would show paid in full, no balance. Balance due would be zero,

Matthias Miller  1:00:37
no. It would show what negative balance due i

Speaker 2  1:00:43
If you cancel it after it's okay, because of the cancel, if you

Matthias Miller  1:00:48
cancel it, balance goes the total goes to zero. Balance due is negative because the customer ever paid, because it need a refund, but because we're filtering by cancelation date on here, it doesn't show up. And so I'm questioning, should we even be filtering by cancelation date on the AR report? If somebody cancels but doesn't issue issue a refund, do you want it showing up as a negative balance in the AR report?

Speaker 4  1:01:12
I think so. I mean, that's how we would catch when we need to refund. Or either, you know, if it's

Speaker 2  1:01:16
if it's still, yeah, if it's legitimately AR that should

Unknown Speaker  1:01:23
well,

Unknown Speaker  1:01:29
but if it's money that should go back,

Speaker 4  1:01:30
then it should show up on the AR as a negative, right, until we do something, right? But I'm questioning like, it seems to me like this was a, why did they take off? So the entire building was canceled. Why? Why did they take off the discount? They should have just left that alone.

Matthias Miller  1:01:47
This. This is a different one. The discount was a, was a buyback. This is a different one. Okay, so, so really, AR needs to look for non zero balance and should not be excluded canceled buildings. I mean, this is this fixes, I think this fixes everything with that, yeah, pull the report

Speaker 2  1:02:15
up. I think that's practically what everything was. Was, No, I mean, oh, that one thing I generated,

Matthias Miller  1:02:23
see, so you wouldn't be checking canceled at all. No, is that what you're saying? Right? That's what I'm saying, because your goal is to get the balance, the balance do zeroed out, and cancelation, just, all cancelation does is changes, changes the invoice total.

Speaker 4  1:02:40
So where are we showing up right now? Like we're not catching these on AR because they're not, and now suddenly we will be forced to go clean these up.

Speaker 2  1:02:49
Yeah, well, and some of them, like the balance is proper, but since the report's not reflecting that, the balance sheet is why the report and balance sheet don't match for a couple days, until that, you know, from invoices, right? Report and balance sheet now, some of them may still have payments that should go back, I don't

Speaker 4  1:03:12
know. Oh, so this, yeah, this, you're saying this should help so that the AR report and the balance sheet should imagine real time, or at least daily, yeah? Let's take a

Matthias Miller  1:03:24
look at this one, because this was a a different scenario. So this is a carport cancelation. And you said carport sales adjustment?

Speaker 2  1:03:36
Oh, yeah, I think I have that one fixed. So these the last adjustment there had been written for the full amount, for the 14,000 right? And there's, there's a bunch of in and out and moving around with all that stuff. Anyway, it needs to be for the same amount as the sales adjustment had been up on right?

Matthias Miller  1:04:03
Makes sense. So good. All right, so here, because this is so going to do this, that we can actually find what needs to happen.

Speaker 3  1:04:19
Is it now only looking at none, just the only change we're actually making is not looking at not filtering out canceled,

Matthias Miller  1:04:31
yeah, and the only reason that we get away with looking at invoicing date is that there is no accounting. There's no ar activity prior to invoicing. I

Speaker 4  1:04:47
so just, is it worth looking at an AR report with that changing, that just sure, seeing what it does? Yeah, will it make a lot of unintended consequences? Yeah?

Matthias Miller  1:05:02
So it's 20, I mean, it added 10 rows here. Let's do this. Let's do, let's do. I

Unknown Speaker  1:05:23
if, if, if, if, if, I would

Unknown Speaker  1:05:36
have expected on the negative amount so we didn't have the negative side.

Matthias Miller  1:05:49
There we go. All right, these guys show up.

Speaker 2  1:05:54
Oh, that's definitely I want to test one down three been

Unknown Speaker  1:05:57
around for about three years. I mean,

Unknown Speaker  1:06:01
somebody new, good.

Matthias Miller  1:06:05
I'm assuming there's no accounting transactions tied to it. Let's see. We have a oh, we have an AR reversal. That's going to work well for you. Why would we move the cancelation date back to the invoicing date? I

Unknown Speaker  1:06:23
it, and then it won't want to write a transaction, right? And then, so that's going to be a mismatch.

Matthias Miller  1:06:31
Well, it's going to wait this one,

Speaker 2  1:06:36
right, but it's going to want to push a mismatch, because it's never going to push it? No, because it's 23 Well, Oh, it'll avoid

Matthias Miller  1:06:44
this one. And because it's 2023 it won't actually do anything. It won't, can't change. It can't change the cancelation date

Speaker 4  1:06:54
from in here, you can have used Dwayne's cool reports. Dangerous report, yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:07:09
you can also do it like this.

Speaker 3  1:07:14
How are you gonna it looks like it's not editable. Never. No, I

Unknown Speaker  1:07:26
I believe you.

Matthias Miller  1:07:31
Okay? So we can't change the cancelation date. That's weird. Well, why would we just change the invoice to

Speaker 4  1:07:42
sorry? I was thinking I have changed cancelation dates on Dwayne's user report, but maybe

Matthias Miller  1:07:49
it doesn't. We could un invoice it.

Speaker 2  1:08:01
Can you leave? Well, no, there is no invoicing transaction. Does that one got I

Speaker 1  1:08:07
think the only way you can change the cancelation date is if you un canceled it and then re canceled it, which would update it to the day, which is not what you

Matthias Miller  1:08:20
want anyway. Why can we just back over here?

Matthias Miller  1:08:36
Why not just do this? Connected there's a building tied to it. What's the story of the building

Speaker 1  1:08:56
down there in the notes? Is the, is the key to the, what the, what that building was. It

Unknown Speaker  1:09:03
is nothing. It's just so the building can be deleted.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:11
Nuke it forever and Amen,

Matthias Miller  1:09:13
like, literally delete, yeah, do I want my name on activity history

Speaker 1  1:09:20
deleted? There's no activity history. Well, attached

Matthias Miller  1:09:24
sales order. Okay, so first we get it. Okay, now we clear the

Speaker 1  1:09:28
here. That was a joke. Matthias, I know there's activities well, but people

Matthias Miller  1:09:33
are very unlikely to stumble, stumble across it. So now we got to unlink it, and if we actually just do that, does

Matthias Miller  1:09:49
that work?

Unknown Speaker  1:09:54
Why don't you want to nuke the sales order?

Matthias Miller  1:09:57
I don't know. We can do the sales order. I. Do we want to do the sales order? Yeah, okay, we're doing the sales order.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:05
Jason lost to sale,

Matthias Miller  1:10:09
and this building is stranded. Not for long. You're not

Unknown Speaker  1:10:13
good, not

Unknown Speaker  1:10:15
for long. Battery might silly story from is it Roger Kipling or the the Mong who is told to snake she

Unknown Speaker  1:10:29
wouldn't be a widow for longer.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:38
We just read,

Speaker 1  1:10:41
I thought you were gonna, I thought you were gonna tell the story about the monkey who got his tail in the fan and said, won't be long now.

Matthias Miller  1:10:52
I mean, then we got these guys. I don't know what the story is on these. These were invoice beyond the go, yeah.

Speaker 2  1:10:58
I don't know if the report's showing it. We could, we could go from there and figure it out. I

Matthias Miller  1:11:07
mean, we can also, you can also take a look at other I mean, there's these as well. So this one was canceled, but it's still showing a balance due. Why is it showing a balance too?

Unknown Speaker  1:11:25
Okay, cancel, well,

Speaker 2  1:11:26
no, it's see refunded goes back to that balance too, that same amount.

Matthias Miller  1:11:33
So, so we're needing to,

Speaker 2  1:11:38
like, canceled, should take away the subtotal, or like should somehow makes it a total of zero, or something like that, and then if the payments not, if there's no reverse of the payment, it would show a negative.

Speaker 4  1:11:50
If we had, we have a payment, any reversing payment. Why is it taking the balance to zero? National Oh, it's because it's canceled. Oh,

Speaker 2  1:11:58
no, it won't. Because he received $33,000 and then gave $3,000 back. So with subtotal, we're back to the amount due, because cancel does nothing except for the checkbox, I believe.

Matthias Miller  1:12:13
So then we need to change the amount owed calculation to take

Matthias Miller  1:12:29
to be something more like,

Speaker 2  1:12:34
like, if it's canceled, if because It does create a reversing transaction. So we need the it the record of the amount owed as your brother stood as well,

Unknown Speaker  1:12:45
and it can, but

Matthias Miller  1:12:49
why is that not that should if, yeah, oh no, if, hang on, I Valley. This is the fluorite logic. But basically here,

Speaker 4  1:13:19
what you're saying Drew is accounting is correct on all of this, it's just the sales are is not reflected out and neither is well accounts receiving report, because it's

Speaker 2  1:13:30
no I think on this one, it's just the accounts receivable report does not reflect.

Matthias Miller  1:13:36
But what we are saying, though, is that the total balance you needs to reflect

Speaker 2  1:13:44
is like, yeah, in this case, it should be, it should say zero, because it's canceled. But it, in history, hasn't, and I don't think anybody looks at they just say cancel.

Matthias Miller  1:14:01
So we could, we could, we could actually, it could actually be something like this, if in Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:14:23
with anyway, we

Matthias Miller  1:14:25
don't have to do it. Let's not sorry, falling in the weeds, getting in the weeds. So I think, I think that this is this. This then becomes the answer to that does take a little deeper down the rabbit, rabbit hole, and that is part of the answer here. Although it would be really nice if we could actually change this. So maybe we actually should.

Speaker 4  1:14:46
So we're basically on a canceled building. We're saying, if it's canceled and and the total payments equals zero, then, then show a zero owed if, if they do. Not like meaning we receive $500 but never to a payment, a negative payment, all setting that then show 500 negative in the ER,

Speaker 2  1:15:12
right? Because that's in all of these that I found, that's what accounting is, is saying tomorrow will be closed, but Friday, because it the invoicing creates the the

Unknown Speaker  1:15:27
AR, the

Speaker 2  1:15:28
cancelation removes the AR, and then any payments also remove or create array like it's deposited. The

Unknown Speaker  1:15:36
county is working correctly. Yeah, I

Speaker 2  1:15:40
think it's just because on the sales order, we've just looked at it as, hey, it's canceled. So

Unknown Speaker  1:15:45
it doesn't matter.

Matthias Miller  1:15:49
So this now shows slightly different items. This 16424, just came off. But we've got folks like this, where there's a cancel on 310 but that should not be,

Speaker 4  1:16:07
what was your invoice date? Wasn't your invoice date on this one later than the,

Matthias Miller  1:16:11
oh, no, that's 25 that was invoiced after was canceled.

Speaker 4  1:16:17
No, it's 24 and 2524 Wow. So this one should, this one should show zero,

Speaker 2  1:16:23
right? The balance should show zero, yeah, for, I mean, not like the amount, dude, the balance, dude,

Unknown Speaker  1:16:28
yeah, the self total would be what it is. But the

Matthias Miller  1:16:31
but we're looking As of this report here is looking as of, let's see what we're looking as of this. This is January 21 so this is actually correct.

Unknown Speaker  1:16:41
Oh, right. There it would be, yeah, for this date,

Speaker 4  1:16:44
look at it as of the cancelation date, then it should go away 330

Unknown Speaker  1:16:47
or something.

Matthias Miller  1:16:54
These are now STI buildings, all right, so that doesn't have anything. Let's do district X for North Carolina. So now here's one that owes a negative, I mean, and this is that's, that's what you should see. There's no refund recorded for this, even though it was canceled.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:22
I Oh

Speaker 2  1:17:27
yeah. So this one's gonna need more work to move

Matthias Miller  1:17:31
it refunded two of the three stripe transactions linked one anyway,

Unknown Speaker  1:17:36
I think we've looked at this.

Speaker 4  1:17:40
Anytime you have that long a list in the notes, it's not a good sign. Bad

Matthias Miller  1:17:44
news. It's bad news. Julia rivers canceled. Was

Unknown Speaker  1:17:58
seven.

Matthias Miller  1:18:01
Why does this still have 574,

Matthias Miller  1:18:19
they refunded the payments. There's the adjustment 286,

Unknown Speaker  1:18:30
why isn't the total imbalance? Because

Matthias Miller  1:18:32
cost of fees on turning payment or something got it. But this isn't zeroing out. Oh, but this is,

Unknown Speaker  1:18:50
there might just have to become a journal entry.

Matthias Miller  1:18:53
It's, it's, it's this number times two, 572,

Unknown Speaker  1:18:57
because the fee they're in the financing line. There's a fee of 286 as well. So not accounting for that, and it's not accounting for that.

Matthias Miller  1:19:13
But don't we actually have something for financing that doesn't affect the um

Speaker 2  1:19:19
adjustment for financing fee, right? The next one down there,

Unknown Speaker  1:19:23
this guy

Matthias Miller  1:19:26
wouldn't this do

Speaker 4  1:19:29
it? Well, this is 24 so

Speaker 2  1:19:32
yeah, but that should adjust the Yeah, it's gonna create a mismatch. But,

Matthias Miller  1:19:39
well, let me not stick my nose where it should go. I think

Speaker 2  1:19:43
we'll figure it out. If it's on the report, we can look at it.

Matthias Miller  1:19:46
Okay. So, so this is definitely, these are definitely things that are necessary, the VG, FGI file. This. Frequencies. I love.

Speaker 3  1:20:04
Go ahead. I didn't quite check what you're wanting to change with amount owed

Matthias Miller  1:20:09
on the amount owed the amount owed. Okay, so we have an amount owed that as of a date, and it doesn't take cancelation into so if you ask for how much is owed after cancelation, the number should be 00.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:24
It should just always Yeah or no. It

Matthias Miller  1:20:28
shouldn't be zero. It should the invoice total, it should be zero, less payments and write offs, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:20:40
I see,

Unknown Speaker  1:20:45
yeah, okay.

Matthias Miller  1:20:47
And so the easiest, best way to do it is probably a series of, like, an extensive series of if statements to not get too clever with it. And just anyway, we can get our heads together on that if

Speaker 7  1:21:00
we need to. I I don't

Speaker 2  1:21:05
know FGI is worth the time right now, because I don't have any hard data. I'm still trying to Einstein and figure out what the best one or not Einstein Thomas has figure out what the question is to ask. Anyway, if AP, I just have a similar thing. I just have a list there of stuff that isn't on the report. That's the report, the

Matthias Miller  1:21:35
invoice payment date is paid. Pay before the invoice date.

Speaker 2  1:21:44
Yeah, that seemed to come up fairly often. So create a negative during that time period between payment and invoice they it should create a negative on the AP report because we paid something that technically we didn't owe yet.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:13
Sure i

Matthias Miller  1:22:27
Is this the kind of thing we should take a look at here to so the invoice date, so we don't actually care about the if the invoice date is

Unknown Speaker  1:22:43
if, let's try this.

Matthias Miller  1:22:54
If, if either an invoice payment date or before the and and it's not paid, or the payment date, if the invoice date is on or before today or the payment date,

Matthias Miller  1:23:17
I don't know there's a date boundary issue that I don't feel like thinking through right now. But then, we need a total where it's basically if I

Matthias Miller  1:23:40
I don't know that's quite right, but it's something like it. Do we have things like it? So here's one invoice in the 17th

Speaker 2  1:24:03
No, that's weird. Why is there a total of negative $200

Speaker 2  1:24:13
that's called Writing a credit without using the credit function. Okay. Well,

Matthias Miller  1:24:27
let's do this. I propose that we do.

Speaker 2  1:24:31
I'd have one on the list there if you want to actually look up a specific item, right there. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:24:38
AR discrepancies. I

Unknown Speaker  1:24:45
think these Excel files,

Unknown Speaker  1:24:51
see,

Unknown Speaker  1:24:56
I'll define the apple i.

Matthias Miller  1:25:14
This guy.

Matthias Miller  1:25:21
Pay before invoice. No, paid before invoice date. Here's one, um,

Speaker 2  1:25:28
so like there's a Lowe's one. Lowe's vendor, invoice number, 96188, that apple one. I do want to look at, though.

Matthias Miller  1:25:41
Okay, so this one was paid 1220, it was dated one, two, and you're saying it's

Speaker 2  1:25:56
I think transactions are right, yeah, accounting, transactions

Speaker 4  1:25:59
should show up on the AP report as a negative in that time frame for the payment amount,

Matthias Miller  1:26:05
one, two. Let's do one. So, so if I take, go back to my experimental report, and was, this, is this North Carolina? Yeah, yeah. Uh.

Unknown Speaker  1:26:28
The invoice

Matthias Miller  1:26:35
or the invoice date,

Unknown Speaker  1:26:40
no the the the I

Matthias Miller  1:26:44
don't know I feel like I

Matthias Miller  1:27:00
uh, let's, let's start with a user report that you can chase down and and go From there before we get to deep in the weeds, almost daily changes and deposited funds.

Matthias Miller  1:27:39
I mean, isn't the anti positive funds issue?

Speaker 2  1:27:47
Maybe pretty much everything I found and what I looked at was has to do with stripe payouts, or recording of credit card transactions that they're not showing up on this report. So yeah, those like Stripe payout number 909.

Speaker 2  1:28:09
Now maybe there's a better report than this one too. I don't know. I

Matthias Miller  1:28:13
don't know it's in the User folder, so I will not your mileage may vary. I we have an official Okay, let's see what one 125, for.

Matthias Miller  1:28:39
So the one we were looking at 8935,

Matthias Miller  1:28:48
okay, so I don't know which one was newer. Include isolated credit card payments. I have

Unknown Speaker  1:28:58
no idea what that does. I

Unknown Speaker  1:29:05
so we have here,

Unknown Speaker  1:29:10
let's go. I'm

Speaker 2  1:29:32
I think it's like, I think the records correct the I

Speaker 2  1:29:46
uh, like so in this case, we're hitting accounting on one one, but we have the credit card payment recorded earlier, which that we're receiving the payment, and then we're coming out of undeposited. And funds with the stripe payout when we you know that records when it hits the bank

Unknown Speaker  1:30:08
so but we're, I wonder, it's not just like a dating difference or something, where it hits report on one date but hits accounting on a different date. I

Matthias Miller  1:30:34
I mean, fundamentally, I

Matthias Miller  1:30:47
we can't, yeah, I don't think we're running out of time. I think this is a that's progress. Yeah,

Speaker 4  1:31:02
good. Anything about cosmic payment.

Speaker 2  1:31:06
The only thing with that is true, needs the bank account that we're saying these checks are from on the file upload. So, I mean, I can just add that to the file after, you know, I download it, or do we have

Matthias Miller  1:31:23
that in there? Do you want it as a second, as another column? Or, yeah, it

Speaker 2  1:31:28
needs to be another column, like we have. You have to give the account with every, every line

Matthias Miller  1:31:39
we don't have. Well, you're

Matthias Miller  1:31:58
gonna use the same number for everything.

Speaker 2  1:32:02
I'm Yeah, I mean, it maybe is something, well, don't we field it on the the account for notch of stuff, like on the bank account, in the GL account, don't we field the account number? Now,

Matthias Miller  1:32:18
sometimes, sometimes, right? Seth,

Unknown Speaker  1:32:21
sure we have it somewhat. Oh,

Speaker 2  1:32:23
no, right? There it is. Like, I mean, this is for ABC, yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:32:27
but this is, this is for, we feel the EIN,

Unknown Speaker  1:32:33
routing number, ID number is that the accountant

Matthias Miller  1:32:37
is the EIN, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:32:38
that's the EIN. That's not the account number. You

Speaker 3  1:32:42
I mean, if you change the Can't we you added that, let me Don't say, but change the ID type. I think you can. I think you can from the account number, but Right?

Matthias Miller  1:32:51
But that's not, that's not this.

Unknown Speaker  1:32:56
No, that's routing number two. Why is that the routing?

Matthias Miller  1:33:01
Yeah, and bank assigned number, which would typically be the account, I'm guessing, but Oh, is

Unknown Speaker  1:33:06
that when you when you do the balance, like shed time, we have the balanced.

Matthias Miller  1:33:12
Oh, there you go. Yeah, yeah. Let's just add a positive pay account number and include it in the export if it's

Speaker 2  1:33:36
specified, figure out how to run the new positive pay

Unknown Speaker  1:33:39
report.

Speaker 2  1:33:43
So I might need a little explanation on that sometime, but it doesn't have to be now

Speaker 4  1:33:49
contractor on it as well. It just turned up blank, but I didn't.

Speaker 7  1:34:02
I well, you have

Matthias Miller  1:34:13
to first well, we need to set the scheduled tasks for the emails if you want to do that. But then you need to specify the positive start date

Speaker 7  1:34:21
for fruit disorder. Oh, okay,

Matthias Miller  1:34:26
but we can well here,

Speaker 2  1:34:35
well, I can go ahead and do that and see if I can figure it out that might make a difference. I 330

Matthias Miller  1:34:55
right? That's what you said. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:34:57
okay, good. You good.

Speaker 4  1:35:05
So Matthias, as far as priorities, you're just going to work from like, seems like there's a number of different things to work on, the sales tax, the reporting discrepancy, is probably the biggest ones. Like, you just gotta start from the top and work through or do we need to? That's what

Matthias Miller  1:35:29
you I mean, that's, I'm fine doing that, unless you guys have care one way or the other. That should be fine. Like, are you going to want to get as an example if, if Josh does? Josh have a time frame for unretrievals?

Speaker 4  1:35:43
No, he doesn't. He still. No, he doesn't.

Matthias Miller  1:35:47
Is it going to happen before July? I

Speaker 4  1:35:53
think it will make

Matthias Miller  1:35:59
Okay. Well,

Unknown Speaker  1:36:01
when he starts on,

Matthias Miller  1:36:04
it starts on mid June, so I realistically won't get to it before July, or we won't if I'm involved in it. Okay, good. I might. I might jump ahead to some of the reporting discrepancies if I get down that far. And

Speaker 4  1:36:20
I think those are, those are probably the most. It's been that way for all the time already. But we probably use those first when we

Speaker 2  1:36:31
Yeah. I mean, it'd be nice to have those things taken care of by the end of the quarter. But yeah, if it can't be,

Speaker 4  1:36:39
mean that and the positive pay, which is, I think that's probably straightforward, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:36:44
so,

Matthias Miller  1:36:46
okay, I think costing also costing versus reporting discrepancies.

Speaker 4  1:36:53
Oh no, costing needs to come first. Yeah, I forgot about that one. Costing should be the first, because there's goals, and goals with money tied to it. So,

Matthias Miller  1:37:09
all right, costing positive pay, reporting discrepancies and sales tax at this point, because of we don't need until July could be kind of a paper cut type of priority. Yeah, good.

Speaker 4  1:37:27
Sweet. The email from Joel, I mean, oh yes, I think that's we were basically saying is good to go right.

Matthias Miller  1:37:35
Write up an incident and prioritize it.

Unknown Speaker  1:37:38
Okay?

Speaker 4  1:37:42
So good. Oh, I'm going to reorder these incidents. The numbers are already based on what we just discussed, so that we're all awesome.

Matthias Miller  1:37:52
Appreciate very much. Good. Sounds good? Thank you. Yep. Thank you. Bye.
