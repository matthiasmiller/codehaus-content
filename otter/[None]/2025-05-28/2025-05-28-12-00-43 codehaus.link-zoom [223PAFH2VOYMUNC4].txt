Speaker 1  01:33
I mapped it over to technoplast. I. am on Zoom, join me when you're free. Hey, there. Hey, Merv. You can see man. Oh, hang on, I don't know. Testing. Testing. I fever. Thank you. All right, let's try that. I'm going to ask you a question. Quick, Matt, here, this email stuff here, I did not look at this. Do you want to pull it up now and just take a look now? Yeah, yep, I do. How do I get this sample? There we go. Log in. All right, so on the first column is what came in on the assembly tracker. Second column is how I mapped it out. The sage third column is a possible guess, which is basically just what in the system looks like. It's closest. And hang on, I had some changes there, if you want to refresh it, I did some more mapping with The new version. So let's see ARSP 58 by I so we don't have an ARSP 58 by 44 in the system. Man, I wonder if and then, there were some like, oh, like, if you scroll down a little bit the tech one, it was a technoplast job. It just put in the wrong thing. And so Man, ah, I thought I'm gonna have to run this by George. Um, let me see if he's a let me see if he's available. Man, okay, yeah, let me

Unknown Speaker  05:17
he might be. I

Speaker 2  05:39
You, George, keep down the pop in here. Device has a couple questions about some items with the item code not uh, matching. Okay, next.

Speaker 1  05:58
Okay, Matt, he's gonna George is gonna pop in here, um, I may have to send this over to his like email to George and let him work on it. Is that okay on the side? Yep.

Unknown Speaker  06:17
Um, yeah, I would probably just do

Matthias Miller  06:27
like this, yeah, well, you could print it for me. Do you

Speaker 1  06:32
have a I don't know if it's gonna print color. No, I don't have a printer hooked

Matthias Miller  06:36
up. Now, if you just forward the email over to him, he can click the link. Yeah, why don't I do that? So,

Speaker 2  06:42
George, here's all for, like, for example,

Speaker 1  06:50
this ARSP 58 space, that's

Speaker 3  06:54
how, that's how it's in sage. It would have to be changed in sage, because I had to ask that same question when we started doing this, does that actually take a picture on my on the sage right compared to what's in the item?

Speaker 1  07:09
Here's what match has in sage. Like these are the same thing, but for some reason, in the set,

Speaker 3  07:16
because, see, they're not going to match. If you change that, when Tina puts it in,

Unknown Speaker  07:21
it's not going to match.

Matthias Miller  07:22
It's not well. But the issue here is, I can, I can handle the matching, the spaces and all that. The issue is that we don't have any item definition for the 58 by 44 we have for the 58 by 4558 by 2646 by 44 44 but not 58 by 44 it's

Speaker 1  07:45
not matching it like these are not the same spacing as sage for some that were supposed to be entered the same again, there's no match at all for this One. The third column is what Matt's guessing might be the match.

Matthias Miller  08:04
Well, the guess is just, it's actually a software guess. Okay, yeah, sure, but yeah,

Speaker 2  08:10
yep. So there's, like, no, no zero in the top

Matthias Miller  08:19
that that's just some kind of junk row or something. I don't know. It's nothing about

Unknown Speaker  08:23
Okay, so,

Matthias Miller  08:28
but like the AR, 509 we got the 506507 and 508 but we don't have a 509 in the system, four or 510 prints. I

Unknown Speaker  08:43
um, do you have

Speaker 1  08:44
time to go? There's like, I don't know, maybe 15 to we'll send the email over to yours and then see what match these are. Like, we need the sage. We need the sage number

Speaker 2  09:05
for this, for

Matthias Miller  09:10
right, Matt, we we really need these items set up in in the cut list generator. That's, that's really what we need.

Speaker 1  09:22
And everything in the assembly tracker was from the beginning of last year to current right

Unknown Speaker  09:29
to I don't know

Speaker 3  09:30
if so, if it's still stuff I'm putting into the old generator, it's going to show up on here. Matt,

Matthias Miller  09:39
well, we haven't pulled across anything from the old generator since about a month ago at this point. So if you put new stuff into the into the old generator, it's not going to be showing up in here. That's

Unknown Speaker  09:52
could be what all of these are.

Speaker 4  09:55
That's what I'm right. I'm not descending that, but I. Right, like this, I would probably say as part

Speaker 1  10:02
of the AR, the Arnold seven, Bassett 10 Bay gate, that's a down the road, number CM, two, like this. These could all be in the last month. The MH, EBS definitely are. We know that.

Matthias Miller  10:21
What if you want? We could, you could send me your updated cut list, and we could,

Matthias Miller  10:37
I could try pulling in all the new, new stuff that you put in there,

Speaker 1  10:47
and see what that does, the item you need, all of that item data anyway,

Matthias Miller  10:54
yeah. I mean, technically, we don't need it. But why are you doing assembly if you're not doing it from the cut list prior. I mean, if it's just for

Speaker 1  11:07
but if, if these are in the if these are since you pulled info from cut list generator, then these jobs would have been entirely added in the cut list generator since then, like, all the item data should be there.

Unknown Speaker  11:25
It's just not

Unknown Speaker  11:27
so, yeah,

Matthias Miller  11:29
like the the RW, Iko, the one of the top of the screen, there's a sage order in here. That one place to start would be, this isn't all of them, but one place to start would be, go, go back into new orders and fix all the orange, orange problems in there, because there's, there's some of that that would, if it's been in the last month, doing that would, would fix it, doing What

Unknown Speaker  11:57
exactly, if you

Matthias Miller  11:59
go back on the menu,

Unknown Speaker  12:02
on this menu, silver

Matthias Miller  12:04
loom menu and hit new orders. Yeah, clear, clear up all these oranges. Yeah, not, I don't this isn't all of our problem. But I mean, this is going to need to happen at some point anyway,

Speaker 5  12:27
because that's fuel surcharge, that's mount area. I don't put mount area and that's Hill Well,

Matthias Miller  12:33
if they're but even if they're not, like on the fuel we should still add that item and make it be a a non material item.

Speaker 1  12:46
Yeah, there's the pink eight. There's the Arnold seven. Yep, the AR one I'm not seeing well, could be further down here. There's a federal Yeah, turf

Unknown Speaker  13:00
is in there. I

Speaker 5  13:07
What is Ken? There's the passive tent. Oh, what is that? Ken? Burn? Where keep going. That one there. What's

Unknown Speaker  13:18
Ken? Keith? He's earned,

Speaker 5  13:20
so we'll put that in there too.

Unknown Speaker  13:26
Matt, what did you say about, like, the fuel and stuff?

Unknown Speaker  13:29
A non order?

Matthias Miller  13:30
Yeah, if you click on new item for one of these that doesn't have doesn't generate cut lists. If you just click the non material item here,

Unknown Speaker  13:43
yeah,

Matthias Miller  13:45
and check and then hit save, we know that there's no cut list for it perfect, and it stops being orange. So that way we know that we know we put some brain power into it so it's not just and if you refresh, you

Unknown Speaker  14:03
Yeah, yeah, nice.

Matthias Miller  14:04
We put brainpower into it, but, yeah,

Speaker 2  14:11
right, same thing. Okay, it's good, yeah, Save and refresh.

Speaker 1  14:25
Yeah, so that would help a lot. And then the ones that, so should what? What's going to be the simplest way? Matt, like this. Mh, Eb, it was a new one. There's no, probably no item data in sage, right?

Matthias Miller  14:49
And we don't, we don't have any item that in here. I mean, it's just a trade off, if you if.

Speaker 1  14:59
New Institute. So is it filled in already on a cut list generator? So it's filled out on a cut list generator. Matt, um,

Speaker 5  15:08
except for the fuel surcharges and all that other

Unknown Speaker  15:12
none of that is, but

Unknown Speaker  15:13
Right, right, right, right.

Speaker 1  15:15
There's, there's about what, 12 to 15 items there that are probably new items. Since you remove stuff, Matt, should we go through and enter it here on the silver loom platform? Or is there an A quick way to migrate the newer stuff?

Matthias Miller  15:35
It'll take me probably 15 to 30 minutes to get everything to to put them in. So how long

Speaker 4  15:46
it take? I just have to get the principle

Speaker 5  15:50
that that Reagan, Amanda has a photo with them, and then just add them into here.

Unknown Speaker  15:58
You can do

Unknown Speaker  16:00
it. Time to

Speaker 5  16:02
do it. Plug it in somewhere, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  16:08
I had one. I did do the camp.

Unknown Speaker  16:12
What's it called?

Matthias Miller  16:15
The can sizes, yeah.

Speaker 3  16:17
And then I played with it a little bit yesterday. And then yield you mean, yeah, like, how many pieces you get out of each one? I'm all done with that, but when I went into I made a cut list for the like, for instance, can go into the

Unknown Speaker  16:34
cut list.

Unknown Speaker  16:40
So silver sizer, cut list

Unknown Speaker  16:46
and then go to Brewer schedule.

Speaker 3  16:51
Now the second Can you see our screen? Matt, yep, that second item, which would be three and a half of 610, foot, two inch oak, I have that in there as six pieces coming out of that can't, in the in the can't, whatever we call quantities. And it's not can't it's still not showing up as how many cans it takes to get that 110

Matthias Miller  17:19
Hang on. Let me take a look. So this is 94153,

Unknown Speaker  17:28
the sky, right there. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  17:37
we have three and a half by six mapping to

Unknown Speaker  17:48
16 by three and a half

Speaker 2  17:50
if you you're gonna go through there anyway and do the fuel the non material item Check

Unknown Speaker  17:59
wouldn't take you right? You're going

Unknown Speaker  18:04
to have to re enter

Unknown Speaker  18:05
some What'd you find

Speaker 1  18:09
out? You have to actually go through here. Brian edit. It's on the

Speaker 4  18:15
advanced New Order. New orders. No, the sage, that sage page, man, I know where it's at. Okay, you think I'll figure it out? Yeah, or I'll send you the email for this little

Speaker 4  18:40
send me email, or can I just flew it in Silver Line?

Speaker 1  18:46
Oh, yeah. You don't need Well, do you want to know which items

Speaker 5  18:50
that's going to show on? Green Up? Should? Yeah, yeah. Let's just Okay.

Unknown Speaker  18:58
That's good.

Matthias Miller  19:01
I All right, let me, let me, let me check one thing here with that cut list,

Speaker 5  19:09
anything else? George with no, I've stopped there because I didn't want to continue. Yeah, no man, I didn't want to go too deep into it until I got it figured out where

Unknown Speaker  19:23
if there's enough, oh yeah,

Speaker 4  19:28
go, thanks. You know,

Matthias Miller  19:36
all right, we just need to push an update. I miss pushing an update. So that's, that's the long and short of it. Okay, pretty sure they'll solve it. Okay, good. So jumping in. Are you ready to take a look at the assembly trial?

Unknown Speaker  20:01
Her, yeah, yep, Thanks, George.

Unknown Speaker  20:09
Sub, what do I do here? Matt, I'm

Matthias Miller  20:14
gonna share it on my screen. Okay, because it's mostly done, but partially work in progress. So I pulled in all history, which you can see here. Worker name, we have the total time, which is the time minus breaks. We got the assembly time, which is less the setup time divided by

Speaker 1  20:43
people. Hang on. Sorry, yep. Can you slow down a little bit? Yep, for my man sized pea brain,

Unknown Speaker  20:55
um,

Unknown Speaker  20:59
or was that no pea sized man brain,

Speaker 2  21:01
right? Something like that, um,

Unknown Speaker  21:07
you said, again, you you said, you have,

Matthias Miller  21:12
so we have so I have here. This is very similar to what you saw on the Excel sheet, except I'm showing Okay, so we have the total time, which is, how long did you work? Minus breaks? Yep. And then I have assembly time. So that's minus the we take the setup time and split it equally across each person and take that out.

Unknown Speaker  21:46
We take, wait, what's

Speaker 1  21:50
let's break that down. What's that setup time that you're dividing

Matthias Miller  21:57
Well, there's not a lot of these in here that have set up time set but let's go find one that does well. Some of them do. Let's, let's go here. All right, so here is on the Viking. We've got a here. Let me pull up this thing this way. No, that's the only guy working on it. Let's try this one. Alright, so here's the hand station. We got a 15 minute set of time we've got, so that gets split equally, and then,

Speaker 1  22:41
so that actually should be 15 minutes per person.

Matthias Miller  22:51
We had had a conversation. Maybe I'm missing this. Okay, fair, yes,

Speaker 1  23:00
yeah, because they're both, I mean, that's, that's how this would be geared. Because I know we wouldn't allot 15 divided by the workers. I think we allotted 15 for our hand station set up.

Matthias Miller  23:22
Here. Going forward, are you going to want to set set up time based on total time, so you could divide it by the number of people, or you just wanted to fix time no matter how many people are doing

Speaker 1  23:37
it. Sorry. Can you say that another phone is distracting me here. I'm sorry so much. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  23:45
So do you want set up time to be just going forward into the future? You always set set up time as this is 15 minutes for everybody. Or do you want to? Because I had thought we had talked about having a setup time be a number where it goes, it goes faster if you've got three people and not as fast if you got two,

Speaker 1  24:07
yeah, which is true, which is true, um, but for a hand station, I guess I'm just, I just know that there's two guys there, and we'll give them 15 minutes On average to set up a hand station, sometimes longer, um, not many times less than that. Um, you know, so we kind of give allow them that 15 minutes. And then some setups are, yeah, like, for longer. We should be able to edit that, but I think it's fair to a lot 15 minute setup time per station,

Unknown Speaker  24:54
per worker, per station, across

Unknown Speaker  24:57
the board would be a good starting point.

Matthias Miller  25:01
Okay, okay, so if I go into here,

Speaker 1  25:06
we had said we have 10 minutes for 504, B, but that's per worker, champion, 40 minutes. Man, is there two guys there? It's a 40 minute setup. Woodpecker is a 40 minute setup, but that's a one man operation. But then sometimes there's two guys there. So then what do you do? So now we gotta make a discrepancy for that

Matthias Miller  25:40
shoot. Well, we can do week, so we can run this one of two ways. Option one is we say, Yeah, well, no, it's two numbers. Now it's, what is this? What is the time for everybody? Sorry, what is the time for each person? And then what's the time to get split out equally,

Unknown Speaker  26:06
right?

Speaker 1  26:13
So 15 minutes per person is a default setup time. Um, except that 504 B, that's 10 minutes per person.

Speaker 1  26:35
Uh, Viking champion should be 40 minutes spread out. Woodpecker should be 40 minutes spread out,

Matthias Miller  26:45
okay, so can we do either or?

Unknown Speaker  26:53
Well,

Matthias Miller  26:56
I know how well. I guess that doesn't matter. The only thing that matters now to me is, can we come up with a way to describe this?

Matthias Miller  27:16
I mean, does this make sense to you?

Unknown Speaker  27:18
Yeah, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  27:23
are we creating two different categories?

Matthias Miller  27:26
Yeah, I guess that's the question. Do you want it? Do you want it to be categories? Or are there, is there anything ever where you want to say, well, this is going to take 10 minutes per person and 30 minutes shared.

Speaker 1  27:40
We could tie it together with the with the difficulty, like rating, like we're doing for cost, cost calculator, like this, based on the assembly method and the fasteners used. Remember that conversation, yeah, scaling the difficulties based on the fasteners that are used. And we could just probably scale right along that same line, if we if we want to, yeah, if we took the time to do that, that might be a really good way to do it. And then, and then, sorry, go ahead,

Matthias Miller  28:33
have the setup time. Depend on the fasteners, etc, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1  28:39
And then, and then, just divide that out per person, if there's three guys and divided by three, if there's two divided by two, if there's one divided by one, yeah, without I think that would be a super good way to do it.

Speaker 2  28:56
That would it would be a well rounded way.

Matthias Miller  29:05
Okay

Speaker 1  29:07
to gage the difficulty of the setup.

Matthias Miller  29:13
So then setup would always be shared. It's just for the hand station, like for the for the Viking and the woodpecker, it would be, it's, it's a shared minutes for the hand station. You go figure out set up time based on the fasteners. And,

Speaker 1  29:38
yeah, well, I think I feel like the champion and the woodpecker and all the Vikings and the woodpecker would fit in the same category, because those are all machine nails, which is the

Speaker 2  29:53
easiest category, right? So you could, you could leave. It.

Matthias Miller  30:08
So how would we? Well, we've got the score calculator here. I

Matthias Miller  30:32
how would we test this hypothesis?

Matthias Miller  30:41
Would we take an item?

Matthias Miller  30:55
Well, let's, let's start by doing this. I

Unknown Speaker  31:18
and

Matthias Miller  31:21
like, what kind of ratio do you end up using to translate this into setup time?

Unknown Speaker  31:39
So it can't be based on number of fasteners, because right now you're, yeah,

Matthias Miller  31:45
it would be the different The there'll be the

Unknown Speaker  31:50
assembly method, like assembly method, well, we could just keep it in one category. It could simply

Speaker 2  32:09
be based on fastener type.

Speaker 1  32:16
So I don't know if that's in a digital form anywhere, but we had a paper. I had a paper with that which I

Unknown Speaker  32:27
still have.

Matthias Miller  32:31
What are the what are the types

Unknown Speaker  32:33
here? Let me show you this man, I don't

Unknown Speaker  32:39
fastener score

Speaker 1  32:41
like, do you remember that? Sorry.

Matthias Miller  32:48
Okay, we go back to the score,

Unknown Speaker  32:59
see what we had put

Matthias Miller  33:02
in the score. We had taken the cost of the fastener.

Unknown Speaker  33:09
We what we

Matthias Miller  33:10
had taken in the in the latest version of the score calculator, we took the cost of the fastener. Oh, wait times, what weight I mean, the times the factor, whatever the factor is up here. Oh,

Unknown Speaker  33:35
sorry, say that one more time. Which of the word feet, parts, number of parts.

Unknown Speaker  33:44
That's,

Speaker 1  33:46
that's the fastener weight, which is determined by amount of fasteners, but also determined by the type of fastener.

Matthias Miller  33:58
Okay, in this version, when we were playing around around with it out here in Colorado, we said, rightly or wrongly, type doesn't matter. Well, we had not included type in this,

Speaker 1  34:11
yeah, but we were going to get to that later, because, like on this page, I had notes that say machine nail bulk was number one, being the easiest assembly method. That's right. Hand staples, number two, hand nails up to two, three, yeah, there was a whole this guy.

Matthias Miller  34:33
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

Unknown Speaker  34:37
There it is. Yep.

Matthias Miller  34:41
So is it price times score, or is it something else? Or is it cost times score, or is it just score? Um,

Unknown Speaker  34:54
I think you left this open for some more

Speaker 2  34:58
editing. Maybe. I. Yeah, like the sort order.

Speaker 1  35:05
I think possibly we were going to use the price of the fasteners for the sort as maybe for the sword order. Potentially, I don't know that, because then you do have cost over there. So,

Speaker 1  35:34
yeah, if I could enter the cost into there,

Unknown Speaker  35:40
it'll be a good starting point.

Speaker 1  35:44
And then that would determine the setup, allotted setup time based on the cost of not amount of fasteners, not how many lags, or how many nails or but simply based on the overall cost of the compile like, if there's two inch nails and four inch nails on the same palette, we'll take the price of a two and a price of a four, and that'll be the cost. There'll be the, what's the word accrued cost of all the each of the different fasteners, maybe, or something like that.

Matthias Miller  36:30
Well, couldn't we just add up? Let me do this. Couldn't we just add up the score For each of the fasteners. So

Unknown Speaker  36:47
fasteners, I

Matthias Miller  37:12
and it'd be a number one through, however, and then we could also, then here, let's do,

Unknown Speaker  37:25
I mean, okay,

Matthias Miller  37:28
Loc, item, fastener score, or scores. And then we could also say, if we wanted to be minimum setup time equals 10, the max setup Time equals 20. And we do something like,

Unknown Speaker  37:57
plus I'm

Matthias Miller  38:11
and then we say it's always going to be 10 minutes, but then we pick a range.

Matthias Miller  38:21
I don't know if this is anywhere close to right. The most fasteners is 10. So we could see it's 10 to 20 minutes, and we plan a minute and a half per score, but, but we're going to force it. It's never going to be less than 10 and over more than 20 or Yeah, I don't know it's, I don't have enough data.

Speaker 1  38:51
Another way we do it, but we don't have it yet, is simply go by the score, once we have this item score, we could use that as the setup. We could use that to dictate allotted setup time for a job, like if the items, yeah, that would that would be a once we have that. We just don't have it yet. But that would be a good well, that would be a best, probably the best way actually to do it.

Matthias Miller  39:33
So what's the best near term if we want to get something? I

Matthias Miller  39:46
like being able to,

Unknown Speaker  39:51
yeah,

Matthias Miller  39:54
I mean, we could say set it type is, i?

Matthias Miller  40:02
This is, maybe doesn't make the most sense, but individual versus shared, and then you have, you still have a set of time in minutes, and for the time being, it's just, I

Matthias Miller  40:25
or, or even this would be just just as simple, just as Simple individual set of time. Well, it's really this. I

Matthias Miller  40:52
if we just, if we just split, set up time into two in the short term, we can, we can then say it's it's always this much per person, and this much gets shared between everybody. And it's not perfect, but it's good enough to start using it. When it's good as what we have, we can start using it, and we can then work on the scoring to get and then figure out what we want once we've got scoring. Okay,

Matthias Miller  41:27
what are your thoughts? Like it, hate it.

Unknown Speaker  41:35
Um,

Speaker 1  41:43
I think so I'm just trying to, yeah, that'd be an easy way to start, right?

Unknown Speaker  41:53
It would be okay, um,

Unknown Speaker  41:58
but we will. But what we have already is,

Unknown Speaker  42:02
is that currently set up to work that way,

Speaker 1  42:06
the 15, the 15 to 10, the 40 to 40?

Matthias Miller  42:13
Well, so my understanding is, well, how would we then? How would we then break it out your

Unknown Speaker  42:26
this is those numbers there should be, oh,

Speaker 1  42:38
I could give you different numbers, and you could divide it by the amount of people. So in other words, the same number just divided out by the number of employees. Okay, to start, that'd be easy right now. So if I would say hand station, 3504

Unknown Speaker  42:59
k sorry.

Matthias Miller  43:00
Hang on one second here, yep, okay. Hand station 30, yep,

Unknown Speaker  43:04
504,

Speaker 1  43:06
a, 30 B, 30 champion, one hour, 60 Minutes. Woodpecker, 45

Matthias Miller  43:21
okay. Do we need something for the duo?

Speaker 1  43:24
No, that the duo is now being called 504 B, you could actually

Matthias Miller  43:30
eliminate that, merge it into 504 B,

Speaker 1  43:33
yeah, yeah. That's yeah, if we need it, yeah. Don't know if for for history. Yeah, for history exactly, if you can do map it over, okay, yep,

Unknown Speaker  43:46
perfect, perfect.

Matthias Miller  43:48
All right, so here, let me

Speaker 2  43:53
make a note of that. Okay, okay, yep, or

Matthias Miller  43:57
me import Viking duo as and then

Matthias Miller  44:19
It's gonna Well, good news is, then that this just works. All right. So for the historical ones, do you want to use the it felt like we were extremely hit or miss on all of these as far as putting in setup time? Do you want me just to use these new numbers for all the historical stuff? Or do you want me to keep what we have for the historical stuff?

Unknown Speaker  44:50
Yeah,

Matthias Miller  44:53
like we only have it for, let's, let's get an actual percentage, only about 10. Percent of them have any kind of setup times in it.

Unknown Speaker  45:05
So for historical

Speaker 1  45:13
that's interesting. I don't know why, because all those like right there, all those items, have a setup time. I wait,

Unknown Speaker  45:20
but what I

Speaker 1  45:29
don't know. I don't understand, like some of it, there's no hand fasteners.

Matthias Miller  45:35
Well, I guess some of these hand fasteners. Well, hang on. Part of the issue is that I'm pulling the hand fasteners from the from the item definition, not from the historical

Unknown Speaker  45:49
input,

Matthias Miller  45:51
but that might need to change.

Speaker 1  45:59
Why? Why would that Sure? Why would that change?

Matthias Miller  46:09
But I don't. I don't know the it. I guess it shouldn't change. I don't know if we've got information everywhere. We should never mind. I didn't say anything. Okay? I

Matthias Miller  46:25
uh, but I think the reason for for the setup time being blank is unless, unless John would hit the Apply Default button, it wouldn't fill in the setup time.

Unknown Speaker  46:41
So, yeah, sorry. One more time

Matthias Miller  46:44
here, let me. Let me share my screen. I'll just straighten.

Speaker 2  46:51
Show you over my desk drawer, my desk on the right, there's some passive crackers in there, right?

Speaker 1  47:02
There? There's a cook cookies. You can get some coffee or water on the by the lunch area. Okay,

Matthias Miller  47:12
yeah, Matt, sorry. Are you able to see the production entry? Yeah. So if I go put something in and then I hit the assembly method, the item and all that, and I add it. It adds it, but I have to click the Apply Default button to pull in the setup time. And I'm just gonna guess when John was putting it in. There's plenty of times he just didn't think about that. He didn't do it. So I would say, I wonder if we just ignore setup time from the import and just use the new numbers and and use that for all of our calculations.

Speaker 2  47:53
Recalculate it. Yeah, yep, that's fine.

Matthias Miller  47:57
Okay? And then the other thing I noticed here in the import was here, let's let me. Let me find it here. So wait, what are these?

Matthias Miller  48:29
We have the one man hand station, but can we just that's that could just work the same as the hand station because of how we're doing the setup time? Right?

Unknown Speaker  48:42
Yeah. That's right.

Speaker 1  48:46
Okay. I wonder if he had any entries with that. Let

Matthias Miller  48:51
me take a look, and I didn't even bother with that. I was just pulling the assembly method off the item. But yeah, well, doesn't look like it

Unknown Speaker  49:03
got so, yeah,

Matthias Miller  49:08
that's right, production tracker, I don't know, though it looks like there might have been. I can't tell. Yeah, there are some in here, okay, but then,

Unknown Speaker  49:24
if we do it, what we just, what we just talked about,

Speaker 2  49:29
apply that team. Yep, that'll work.

Matthias Miller  49:32
Exactly, good,

Matthias Miller  49:40
valid times missing items is underway.

Matthias Miller  49:57
Okay, the other. There a big issue here is, I don't know if I could find an example. There was one.

Unknown Speaker  50:18
Maybe there was I let me do this. I'm

Unknown Speaker  51:00
Um, well, I might have to actually Run it. I'm

Matthias Miller  52:08
all right, the 939, or what's the later? 173,

Unknown Speaker  52:17
18, I

Matthias Miller  52:28
so here's one where, I guess it's probably this row right here, where there's no quantity specified. Yeah, yes, we, we can just treat those as zeros. Is that fair?

Speaker 1  52:50
When you sorry, like no quantity. They were set up for amount of time, but zero in the quantity? Yeah, I

Unknown Speaker  53:04
Is there a lot of those?

Matthias Miller  53:08
Not a lot. But then there's also weird ones, like this one,

Unknown Speaker  53:17
just get a napkin or something paper. You can say that and look

Speaker 1  53:20
at a paper towel before you do that, because the honey only honey will leak down through. Sorry, Matt, I'm here.

Matthias Miller  53:25
Oh, good. Um,

Unknown Speaker  53:28
tissue. Don't you

Unknown Speaker  53:30
want more peanut butter? Oh, you want more? You good? Is that enough? I'll get you more if you bring it over. Yeah, there is like, it's up to you. You can bring it over if you want. Yeah, Matt, I'm with you. I'm sorry.

Speaker 1  53:54
Josh is working out here today. He's in for break. Nice.

Matthias Miller  54:02
So, like, here's another one where it's 54 sides, 54 ends. There's some other weird ones that we do. Like, I mean, 20 sides, one palette, 90 Ed and 160 sandwiches, 120 bats only, somewhere, somebody threw a date in there, 14 sides,

Unknown Speaker  54:29
and no quant, no quantity. Or,

Matthias Miller  54:33
yeah, I mean, I mean,

Speaker 1  54:35
that would be something where they're doing a crate and they didn't complete any but he wasn't supposed to ever enter any quantities other than the quantity of items completed. And so in a scenario where guys are building different. Parts to build a crate. Well, if two guys worked yesterday afternoon with zero completed, and then two other guys work today, and all together, they completed five, the five would get distributed equally to the four guys that worked on it based on their contribution of time, right? That was the that was the intention. Like, John, yeah, he what I'm seeing in this here. Matt is basically information that probably like numbers, amounts of mats or sides and ends, or sides or sandwiches. Sandwiches, mats, sides, ends.

Unknown Speaker  56:00
Do not

Speaker 1  56:03
they're part of the quote, The they're part of the value, but they're not completed items. It's a separate number. It's like, how many pieces of runners did you need to build your 10 pallets? Like they're irrelevant? Number?

Matthias Miller  56:21
Sure. Right? So, really, what this means in the really what? But what it means, though, is that for each of these jobs, somewhere, some people got credit for completing the whole thing.

Matthias Miller  56:39
Most likely, like here we've got wave wave 20. I don't know this is it, but Brian then completed wave 20. Probably,

Unknown Speaker  56:57
yeah, nah. I mean, can we go to

Speaker 1  57:09
it? Jesse, 54 sides, 54 ends, or however many that says that was on 422,

Unknown Speaker  57:21
somewhere.

Matthias Miller  57:23
Up here, there's 27 which would be 54

Speaker 1  57:29
it takes two sides and two ends. So they the then Brian and Simon assembled the crates, and that was the 26 i Six that like that shouldn't have been entered, right? Yeah, that shouldn't have been entered. And then the 27 should have been credited to all four guys based on their total time contribution. There Hiro, Jesse, highro Jesse twice, and then Brian and Simon one time. I

Matthias Miller  58:29
so I can, I can. I mean, how do we want to handle this? I can go piece together this, we could tell John, John, you got to fix up the spreadsheet. That's going to be a disaster.

Unknown Speaker  58:47
Yeah, I think

Speaker 1  58:57
I for historical reference, I need to know the amount of time that was spent to finish those 27 kind of regardless of who gets credit for it. So let's keep the 27 Yeah.

Matthias Miller  59:18
Well, we could. We could also, well, I can, we can manually go in, or I can manually go in, or somebody can, for all of these, and go edit, go find what it actually should have been, where it should have been, and just manually input. All right, manually input the the additional time on there. It's probably not that bad to actually do that. So like after, after I import, let's go back to um. Um,

Unknown Speaker  1:00:05
gosh,

Unknown Speaker  1:00:07
I'm leaving. I'm leaving around 330 for car park, so you'll have to walk him then.

Speaker 2  1:00:13
Okay, good. Hey, bud, don't forget to clock out. Okay, ask somebody to help you if you need help. Okay,

Matthias Miller  1:00:31
423, so we've got Brian Gonzalez on the this guy. So we just go in here, find, find this one, come down to where these other other guys were.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:04
And

Matthias Miller  1:01:08
put in 947 let's see seven to 947 I don't know why that needs to be split out, but anyway, to 1111. 1111 and go add, basically, manually add these, these guys in here, these. That's not right. I got my times wrong, but 1111 and 330

Unknown Speaker  1:01:36
anyway, no, no, don't change our times because they

Matthias Miller  1:01:39
were, no, I'm not changing the time. I got the wrong rows, 970, 1111, 11 to 330 and then go do the same thing for Jesse real, yeah, and boom, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:02:00
yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:02:01
but his set of time, well, that's great.

Speaker 1  1:02:17
But Matt, well, I mean, if we don't, if we don't care about individual credit, which, for historical reasons, like, the individual credit doesn't matter as much, like if

Unknown Speaker  1:02:38
it's just a couple times.

Speaker 1  1:02:42
So even if Jesse and Hyrule get credit, it was zero for that nine or whatever, to 330 and Hira and Simon, or Simon and Brian get credited for,

Unknown Speaker  1:02:59
you know, all of those

Speaker 1  1:03:03
the program would still like if I want to go back and say, okay, wave what is that? Wave 20. Wave 20. Here's how many we've made over the last year and a half. Here's how much time it's taken us. Here's the average time per item. That's the historical data that I really need. I'm not going to go back and necessarily do. I mean, I can look at these guys individually, but if I want to look at it once we have scores set up, and I will say, hey, how, how did Brian what was Brian's average score every day that he worked? What was Jesse's average score? Like it's going to come out in the wash, yeah, rather than spending a bunch of time cleaning it up. But if it's not a lot, and you understand it, I think, obviously, but if that makes sense, like I want to keep the items completed. I want to keep that category, eliminate the sides and ends from that category, keep everybody's time and the person's name and the item ID for historical reasons. If some guys missed out on credit because we changed the size and ends to a zero,

Unknown Speaker  1:04:36
I'm not too worried about that.

Matthias Miller  1:04:38
My My feeling is it's going to be just as easy to assign it to these guys. Okay,

Speaker 2  1:04:43
but understood, no, okay, that's fine, yep,

Matthias Miller  1:04:49
all right, okay, so that handles invalid quantities. We're working on the missing items. Let's see all. Right, so then. So here's the tracker, the Okay, the big question on the assembly tracker, we had talked about tying these out to Sage orders so that you can assemble only assemble like right at a at a minimum, you can't assemble more than what they bought right and out of if you want to take it further, actually, that would be the easiest way to do it. If we want to take it further, you can't assemble them until they've been cut. But depending when that stuff gets entered, I don't know if you want to do that.

Speaker 1  1:05:37
No, sometimes they'll be sorry. Sometimes we'll be cutting stuff. Oh, we didn't have enough, or, Oh, we ran out, or they'll start the job before everything's cut. So sure, okay, well, I like your idea. You can't get credit for more than the order. But then what happens in if they make too many you were talking about. You know, if they actually made too many, there's an alert or something like that.

Matthias Miller  1:06:13
Well, you just warn. If you put in a, if you put in a quantity, that's more than Yeah, yeah. And it might be easier, is it fine to just put in the item? You select the item that was made, then you have to map it out to which order it was,

Unknown Speaker  1:06:37
yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:06:39
yeah. Because most times there's only going to be one,

Unknown Speaker  1:06:44
well, I shouldn't say that.

Matthias Miller  1:06:49
I mean, you default to the most recent open order that has incomplete items. Yeah, that's right, but you might also have very unlikely for this to happen, but you could, in theory, have somebody who places two orders, and you assemble a quantity that's too much for one and not enough for the next,

Speaker 1  1:07:19
then it would go to the next order. Now, because that will happen, I don't like it, like we have Armstrong 46 by 46 AR, 0010001, they'll order 6789, 10, truckloads a week. And so someday, yeah, some like the machine won't do the whole load. And then, I don't know if order numbers are attached to each load, or maybe multiple loads at times, but it should if, if it would go to the oldest open order first would be The best scenario.

Speaker 2  1:08:14
Yeah, I think Yeah, makes sense.

Matthias Miller  1:08:21
Um, we can get into the entry piece now, but currently, the way that it works is, if you want to,

Matthias Miller  1:08:35
if you do something like this and you add a new row, it'll copy the times from the next one. And if you need to change it, you can, so that just makes it fast to fast to put

Unknown Speaker  1:08:45
in. Yup,

Matthias Miller  1:08:47
alright, so not much interesting there. Here's where things get really fun, the assembly analysis report. Okay, so you can choose any number of customers, choose any, any number of items. And I think the item, well, you should theoretically be able to

Speaker 4  1:09:10
materialize what is going on here. You

Matthias Miller  1:09:15
can't select items right now, I'll look into what that is. You can date range and then a team match. This one's a little bit of the complicated piece, but you can say, I want to match on this exact team. So I want to know, let's just run this in group by teams. I can grab some names, but I want to look at any time

Matthias Miller  1:09:50
Gustin and Dave work together, and I want to group by. I think, I think when they work together, one's more productive than the other. Now this doesn't really that's actually not meaningful, because if it's only these employees, I think that they're better on some customers, I think, I think they've been slowing down. So let's group it by date. And so this is only orders for them based on date. Or I want to say I want these guys, but I want to see any teams that have where they're both involved, and I want to group by the team. And then I want to group by month. So now, anytime those two are working together, here's this team, here's this team, this team and this team. And then I want to say, well, actually, I want to find anytime these guys are working anywhere, all right, so now it's solo, you know? Now we got the whole so you gotta wrap your head just a little bit around what it is you're looking for, yeah, but you could, then you can, I mean, you can slice and dice this thing, literally any way you want to. And when you, when you group by employee as an example, it'll show individual contribution. Everything here is factored by contribution. Yeah, well, everything here, really, yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:11:56
is that what you're after?

Unknown Speaker  1:11:58
I think so? Yeah. I

Matthias Miller  1:12:02
mean, there's a lot of

Matthias Miller  1:12:11
scoring. The big piece is getting scoring in here

Speaker 1  1:12:14
right at the end, yeah, because exactly at the end of the year, if we get a good scores, like if we have a good score, I also want to use it as a pricing tool. Could just to start to use it to compare our current pricing tool, right? But also at the end of the year, I am we have certain bonuses that the guys get. One is based on years of service. Two years ago, I started giving a second amount to guys for above and beyond contributions. And I would certainly use this to look at individual, maybe, you know, average daily score or score for the year when it comes to doing that other bonus, yep.

Matthias Miller  1:13:21
So I wonder, I wonder something here. I wonder if I've got the, I wonder if I got those factors, because the score per assembly hour would be a pretty interesting metric.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:35
Yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:13:39
let me see. If not. Okay, here, here's the All right score calculator I'm going to put, I'm going to plug these numbers in, which is what we'd come up with earlier. And it's not perfect, but it gives us something to play around with, 4510 45 and I'm also going to put that in the live system, so that's there. Okay, so then if we change this report

Unknown Speaker  1:14:13
to this would

Matthias Miller  1:14:19
be score per hour, um,

Matthias Miller  1:14:52
let's add a decimal. I'm.

Matthias Miller  1:15:03
And then let's do let's run this from, let's do it on everybody. And let's run it from one, 125, and let's just do it on everybody. I'm

Matthias Miller  1:15:30
so do you think

Unknown Speaker  1:15:38
this? Course, sorry,

Matthias Miller  1:15:39
this, these was using numbers that we were playing around with when we used with the without, it's, it's, it doesn't have the fastener factors, but it scores that we use, and we're playing around with the score calculator, and when you're out here.

Speaker 1  1:15:53
So can you order these by hourly score? Right now? I

Speaker 2  1:16:03
Miguel, Julio, so I'm in the water.

Unknown Speaker  1:16:10
That is interesting, right there. Man, no, no, huh? Does this

Matthias Miller  1:16:17
match reality? It pretty

Unknown Speaker  1:16:18
much does. Yeah. I mean, it's

Unknown Speaker  1:16:25
Yeah.

Speaker 1  1:16:29
Jerry, well, Jerry Borden, man, he's down there. I'm not sure why he's not getting more. Mickey Navarro and Levi am No, something's off there. The Levi M Fisher, Jerry Barton and Mickey Navarro and Dan king, they all spend a lot of time on the 504 a so they're not getting the proper credit. But otherwise, yes, very much. Yeah, there's something with that 504 a where those guys weren't getting the proper credit. But

Matthias Miller  1:17:11
is there a certain type of fastener or something that would

Unknown Speaker  1:17:16
probably what did we okay, we haven't

Matthias Miller  1:17:22
you? This will be machine passengers.

Speaker 1  1:17:25
We spread this out in the categories of one to 10. Matt, so every time we changed, we went from 10, then we went to 20s, then we went to 30s. So that 504 A is machine Nils bulk. So the diff a, difficulty of the number 10, like, well, it's getting spread out too much, so we should, like, really crunch it down.

Matthias Miller  1:17:57
Well, what I mean this? So sort order doesn't have anything to do with difficulty. The score is the only thing that should have anything to do with difficulty, but we haven't. So what we could do, and I don't know if this is right, let's go into the score calculator. Like in the score calculator, theoretically, what you want to do is, I

Matthias Miller  1:18:31
is something like this, where you take the cost times I am

Matthias Miller  1:19:00
so you take the cost times the score times the weight,

Matthias Miller  1:19:11
Which, if you then run that against This one, you

Unknown Speaker  1:19:29
don't you like I

Matthias Miller  1:19:45
is that and let's sort again.

Speaker 1  1:19:54
So all the guys doing hand work are still getting by far better score. Hours than the guys on the machines. So the handwork, like, I think our top one was in like a 1/3 Well, you said it's not.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:19
Are you sure about

Unknown Speaker  1:20:21
what? Are we how? Sorry, how are we calculating the

Unknown Speaker  1:20:26
score? Again,

Matthias Miller  1:20:29
great. The way that we had been doing it is just, what's the total cost times the fastener weight? Now I'm proposing that we take the cost times that fastener score, one or two times the overall weight.

Speaker 1  1:20:54
I mean, to get the real score, we need the board, fee, the parts.

Matthias Miller  1:20:58
Well, that gets Sure. Sorry, that gets so board feet times the board feet weight, which is point 45 the cost of fasteners times the fastener score, times the fastener weight is also point 45 and then the parts times the parts weight, which is like A point one. I

Matthias Miller  1:21:41
did not want to do that. Want to do that. Sorry.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:50
Anyway,

Matthias Miller  1:21:52
I think it just means, excuse me, it just means we got to figure out how we want to. We got to wrap our heads around around the actual scoring model, right,

Unknown Speaker  1:22:03
right, right.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:11
So you're saying back on that other page,

Unknown Speaker  1:22:17
the fasteners pay list? Yeah. That sort

Speaker 1  1:22:23
order is not a contributing factor. No, it's not

Unknown Speaker  1:22:28
all right? Um, yeah, we're gonna have to get I'm

Speaker 1  1:22:43
that you had that other page. We need it. We need to enter the cost of the fasteners somewhere. We need to capture.

Matthias Miller  1:22:53
That's a good point. That's that's messing up your scores substantially on the hand fasteners,

Speaker 1  1:22:59
right? We need to, we need to capture. I need to enter that just like George entered to can't yields like I need to get in that cost into this system. Yep. So I would say, whenever you're one, you're ready. Email that over and I'll go over everything and update, update all those numbers, okay, and add the missing ones. Okay, well, Should I, should I do that? Well, I should do it on your on silver loom, right? Yeah, that's right, yeah. So whenever, yeah, whenever you want me to whenever, yep.

Matthias Miller  1:23:45
I mean, as soon as you I think I'm at the point, I got a little bit of stuff, work, stuff left to tie this out to the sage orders at this point, and and doing quantity tracking and limits, okay, but I'm pretty close to as soon as we got that done, then I'm ready to start pushing, pushing tracker information across.

Speaker 1  1:24:15
Okay, so email, yeah, so email that over to me and I can send it to Amanda, right?

Matthias Miller  1:24:24
Yeah, if she's got a you might need to set up a login for,

Speaker 1  1:24:28
okay, yeah. Or, or, do you want? Do you want

Matthias Miller  1:24:31
me to send an Excel file and do it that way? Yeah,

Speaker 1  1:24:36
that'd be perfect. If you want email that to me, we'll fill it in, send it back to you. Perfect, awesome, okay, applause.

Unknown Speaker  1:25:01
All right.

Unknown Speaker  1:25:07
Um, any other things we should go over?

Matthias Miller  1:25:12
Uh, no, okay, same

Speaker 1  1:25:14
here. Um, I love it, man. We're we need more orders. Matt, where our orders are down. On on board feet, we're down couple 100,000 board feet, like two something 100,000 but on overall, sales were down like $500,000 for the year so far. Ouch. So that's hurting the bottom line a lot. We're not losing, but it's Yeah, so it's uh, it's just a it's crazy, like we're trying to roll out incentive program, but our guy and our pricing is down a little bit right now because the PAL, because lumber prices get pushed down, then pallet prices go back down. So then how do you you know, like, payroll doesn't change, that just keeps going up, but pallet prices go up and down, so trying to match the healthy incentive system to that, you know, I mean, like Rick mentioned, well, when the company's doing good, the guys are going to benefit, and that's, I think that's okay, But when the when the numbers are lower. That's not necessarily their fault. It should be based, I think we're gonna have to if we should be capturing the it should be going, I don't know. It should be dictated somehow by profitability. I guess, regardless

Unknown Speaker  1:27:03
of,

Speaker 1  1:27:05
regardless of the product prices or the like the index right of, regardless of pricing, somehow, anyway,

Matthias Miller  1:27:18
well, but if you would, if you would, roll out a incentive program, and you would feed that to your top 30% and and they would they could probably pick up the slack of the bottom 10 to 20%

Speaker 1  1:27:36
Yeah. And you know what like, if I have the perfect system, we'll do it individually. But that was very seemingly far off, and it wasn't within reach for like, the individual who's helping me with it, you know? And so it was much easier to go whole, whole shop. And then, with that being said, the scoring that could, that could, then I could use that just to dictate their hourly rate, right, make sure they're at a proper spot. So there's all kinds of ways to do it, right? So,

Matthias Miller  1:28:25
yeah, the other, the other not related to this project, but the other thing is getting, I don't know, I don't know how much of this can be, can be driven by a really good salesperson, but that's, I don't know. I don't know what that situation's like. I don't even

Speaker 1  1:28:47
I just fired the salesman that I hired in a couple months ago.

Matthias Miller  1:28:52
Well, I I got a friend of mine who who his thing is hiring salespeople, and he's had really good, good success. And, yeah, I've heard from from folks that they're happy with it, but

Speaker 1  1:29:09
I remember you talking about that, and I'm not. Yeah, I don't want to minimize that possible possibility here, how that could maybe help us out.

Unknown Speaker  1:29:25
So

Speaker 1  1:29:29
unless you're moving, if you move east, you gotta let me know. Well,

Matthias Miller  1:29:39
yeah, well, I, I don't see that very likely in my future, but, and that's okay, never say never Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:29:51
that doesn't that doesn't mean

Speaker 2  1:29:55
that doesn't stop Yeah. That doesn't stop good things from that. Happening, yep, um, cool. All right, yep, that's good. All right, I'll be in touch. Yeah, thanks, Matt. Yep, thanks. Thanks
