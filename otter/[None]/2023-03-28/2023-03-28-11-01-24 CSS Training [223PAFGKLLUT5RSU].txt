Matthias Miller  01:16
spirit nothing really to do here

Matthias Miller  01:24
be archived I've moved the items

Unknown Speaker  01:28
okay well

Unknown Speaker  01:39
I guess he has

Unknown Speaker  01:46
brilliant

Unknown Speaker  01:59
be moved into here

Unknown Speaker  02:15
yes

Speaker 1  02:29
we're still waiting to hear back from them on standardizing terminology between canine and dog and stuff like that sounds good let's go ahead and put that

Unknown Speaker  02:51
there for now

Unknown Speaker  03:00
words

Matthias Miller  03:02
were at least going to

Matthias Miller  03:18
know it's kind of putting it down the road but

Unknown Speaker  03:29
mobile use

Matthias Miller  04:30
think that's a question for well

Matthias Miller  05:31
We talked about having a portal for

Unknown Speaker  05:37
trial drivers

Unknown Speaker  06:08
we call it a

Unknown Speaker  06:16
All right tight on your class

Unknown Speaker  06:29
A

Unknown Speaker  07:28
we're sitting down it's annoying and it's clearly down

Matthias Miller  08:40
do you have a full does he mean all the options?

Speaker 1  08:44
Thanks so we have not gone through all of those options yet do you have

Matthias Miller  08:57
in the gym easy link to that do you see walk

Speaker 1  09:03
through that not this Options page yet no I'm trying to remember snack snagged a screenshot of it

Unknown Speaker  09:43
I know he

Matthias Miller  09:43
he touched on it a little bit in the video but he didn't. Specifically.

Unknown Speaker  09:48
Yeah, I don't have a screenshot of that or anything like that. So I was expecting that we'd get more of a walkthrough of each of these each tab and what was supposed to go in each one there really shouldn't be like that then

Unknown Speaker  10:28
I don't know whether animal record is custom

Unknown Speaker  11:53
it's no wonder

Matthias Miller  12:09
it brought up whether we want to use actually incidence here for this or not

Unknown Speaker  18:07
We

Unknown Speaker  21:34
All right um

Unknown Speaker  22:04
by the way there's a research only

Matthias Miller  22:11
AI engine that you can run can't use it for commercial purposes but that you can run locally on your own computer without needing to be connected to the internet

Unknown Speaker  22:21
interesting

Unknown Speaker  22:28
how does that work you got to be connected to the internet so you download the engine itself

Matthias Miller  22:37
and then you feed it a whole bunch of data for training

Unknown Speaker  22:43
and then just use that

Matthias Miller  22:45
gotcha that stuff as the basis for interest.

Unknown Speaker  23:55
Thank right, or is there something else that you're referring to something else? I'm not sure I couldn't find exactly what he was referring to there. What you cleared up with was

Matthias Miller  24:15
a century or so.

Matthias Miller  25:14
How would we want to do

Unknown Speaker  25:22
don't want to talk to you

Matthias Miller  25:26
most everybody is hounding me today

Unknown Speaker  25:42
mass entry

Matthias Miller  26:10
most of your editable reports work in the context of existing records so the whole idea of Let Me Go tell you what record I want to update doesn't really exist here

Speaker 1  26:26
the same way so

Matthias Miller  26:40
how we would probably all things being equal probably what we do is just give you a big fat report of all the active dogs and serial numbers and have you go find the right one and update it or

Unknown Speaker  26:55
we could have

Matthias Miller  26:59
Okay, so here's an option

Unknown Speaker  27:13
hey can we do this?

Speaker 1  27:44
Had some reason for not wanting it to detail to today and I can't remember what it was

Unknown Speaker  27:54
okay

Unknown Speaker  27:59
it should be manually set I forget why. No

Speaker 1  28:11
BX initially it was like, Oh yeah, defaulting today is fine and then, at some point changed his mind.

Matthias Miller  30:05
Okay so the other way to do it would be to have a record that

Matthias Miller  30:19
basically a mass weight entry record and then within that there's two ways you can do it you can require them to save before you apply it and then you delete the record once it's done once you've done that or you can never you could allow you could you can never allow it to be saved

Unknown Speaker  30:46
and

Unknown Speaker  31:05
which you

Matthias Miller  31:29
but I'm trying to think how do you make sure how you test the interaction with the rest of the system if you do this

Matthias Miller  31:41
because you get into all kinds of weird stuff with if you set a record and somebody modifies data dog weight as of that day or they run it once and they needed a way to clear out the RG

Matthias Miller  32:03
effectively or you run into issues where somebody changes the date and tries to rerun it and you get a second row in there

Matthias Miller  32:26
I don't know that there's a really good clean elegant solutions

Unknown Speaker  32:29
we do in this way mass entry

Unknown Speaker  33:12
here's one here's a way that could work.

Unknown Speaker  34:54
Well, there you go. That's actually

Matthias Miller  34:57
not a that's not a tear. Probably unreasonable way to go about it

Unknown Speaker  35:33
now

Matthias Miller  35:52
oh here we have a craft you here's a crafty way

Unknown Speaker  36:09
how much of the

Unknown Speaker  36:37
I like this actually So

Speaker 1  37:29
the color isn't necessary so that's one of like four or five different spots that they have the ability to edit the color and that's because on the new dog entry they don't have a spot to enter the color okay, we can fix that. Yeah, so he said as long as there's one spot probably in the new dog entry to enter the color that but somehow in the creating of their new or of their software and they kept adding bits and pieces they never added a an option to add color and weight to the new dog and three so that's why there's two or so editable so many of the weight doesn't need to be math changed for letters and whatnot instead color it's in one spot and that is fine so

Unknown Speaker  38:33
okay so and then are dosages

Matthias Miller  38:46
here's the thing I wasn't sure about either or dosage is ever done besides just on a dog or litter or they sometimes done across multiple dogs that aren't in

Speaker 1  38:55
the same litter not sure he said dosages might not need to be kept he wasn't like he said that was just starting to get out of his area of expertise with it also he's not entirely sure that dosages need to be kept like that would seems like a dosage would vary depending on the animal if it's a dosage by weight then you'd have an adjustable per animal but I don't know he said my notes here it's a dosages might not need to be. That might be something we want to find out more about. Okay, well I would be lighted

Unknown Speaker  40:41
Okay.

Matthias Miller  43:03
Eyes are starting to learn this stuff?

Unknown Speaker  44:11
We're gonna Really

Unknown Speaker  45:21
We can't do color markings here?

Unknown Speaker  49:01
Know what this minute 48 is pretty

Unknown Speaker  49:17
soon

Matthias Miller  50:49
All right rapidly losing steam here

Unknown Speaker  50:54
I wonder

Matthias Miller  51:01
if you've got energy to keep working on permitted or not, but I wonder if we should I think I'm going to need to table it for a bit and then come back to it and maybe an hour or so if you are available.

Unknown Speaker  51:16
Yes, I should be.

Matthias Miller  51:22
Alright, let's give it a shot.

Speaker 1  51:23
I'll look through that video too and see what I find. Okay, sounds good. Thanks.
