Speaker 1  01:04
sound like live and record just the little section of it and put it right there next to that to do so I'm not entirely sure what all of it is still helpful to us now that we've had the walkthrough what could still be useful?

Speaker 2  02:05
All over vaccinations, right here is our letter history. So you can go in and just double click and it will pull up the letter. And here is all the vaccinations that were assigned to the letter. Here is the puppies that she had. So you'll see that she this isn't a really this isn't a good mom. She started with eight, eight of them, and we weaned

Unknown Speaker  02:35
six. Yeah,

Speaker 2  02:37
not started with nine. Anyway, these these here represent puppies that died while here is on the side died are euthanized. The numbers are the ones that ended up being weaned.

Unknown Speaker  02:51
So

Speaker 2  02:54
all the nasty allergy. So here would be does the stud.

Unknown Speaker  03:01
So that will always

Speaker 2  03:03
all this information will track back to the dog. If we click on this individual dog, and over here

Speaker 1  03:08
and see some of your screen. There we go. Where does it there's a good litter

Matthias Miller  03:21
in the top right that I

Unknown Speaker  03:24
noticed earlier.

Speaker 2  03:26
So then you can just go back and see that it doesn't show right on the actual dog itself. But you can always go back to the litter and figure out who the stud was date bred.

Unknown Speaker  03:40
And then there's also some

Unknown Speaker  03:41
metrics in here.

Matthias Miller  03:49
Make sense? And then the actions and action can be added to a both to either to a litter or to an individual's dog.

Speaker 2  04:00
Yeah, so that's pretty much so pretty much everything happens. mass action, you know, a lot of animals at once. But if we figured out something's been missed, you can just come in individually assign that to the lender or the dog.

Unknown Speaker  04:19
Since probably getting a little

Matthias Miller  04:25
deeper in the weeds that we need to but we'd like we'd still born in mortality rate. Are those auto calculated in

Unknown Speaker  04:33
any way? Yes.

Matthias Miller  04:40
And that would just be based on the literary. Right? We have that information on the dog itself. Yep, makes sense. I don't think we need to go further on that.

Unknown Speaker  04:52
I think that's all calculated.

Unknown Speaker  04:53
Now I'm not sure because

Unknown Speaker  05:01
Yes, yes auto calculated

Unknown Speaker  05:02
yeah

Matthias Miller  05:13
all right. And then you had mentioned tracking skews skew.

Unknown Speaker  05:17
Well yeah. So

Matthias Miller  05:25
mass action stored on the litter or stock stored on the dog

Unknown Speaker  05:38
the mass

Matthias Miller  05:38
action would have been assigned to each particular

Unknown Speaker  05:41
dog

Unknown Speaker  06:02
so what we're looking at here was probably

Unknown Speaker  06:06
died or euthanized.

Unknown Speaker  06:12
Going off type

Unknown Speaker  06:20
used

Unknown Speaker  10:10
Do you have any interest in driving for a bit okay

Unknown Speaker  11:00
see whatever

Unknown Speaker  11:10
it is that to

Matthias Miller  11:11
do HLD you can probably make to add

Unknown Speaker  11:13
splint yeah

Unknown Speaker  11:25
some of them will be

Unknown Speaker  11:45
could go into history could

Speaker 1  11:52
think so yes yeah

Unknown Speaker  12:24
questions

Matthias Miller  12:38
okay so we could start by filling in the overview with this record is used to track

Unknown Speaker  12:50
all kind

Matthias Miller  12:51
all of the different order types

Unknown Speaker  12:56
or types of orders

Matthias Miller  13:24
Thanks So Tim's comments like the

Matthias Miller  13:39
under order type you could add sub bullets there

Unknown Speaker  13:42
and down here

Matthias Miller  13:48
the order type oh there's two well that one there is actually

Unknown Speaker  13:53
duplicate that one can go oh yeah and then

Matthias Miller  14:02
there yes and then we could do

Unknown Speaker  14:05
sub points

Matthias Miller  14:08
if you indent dog slash pig is four

Speaker 1  14:14
we choose animals. Transport is for other animals. Protocol is for housing animals

Matthias Miller  14:51
yep I think that takes care of most of Tim's comments except orders can be shipped in multiple shipments that you should keep there or transport order has less than four pull from the database for manual entry.

Unknown Speaker  16:01
Think for for the that bottom

Matthias Miller  16:03
piece there we could do a shipping zone record

Unknown Speaker  16:08
with a name and a

Matthias Miller  16:13
small truck rate and a large truck rate

Unknown Speaker  16:17
just a completely new section thank you yeah, it would be

Matthias Miller  16:23
under probably under Configuration well yeah under under Configuration record then we'd have a shipping zone record

Speaker 1  16:46
there's a snippet for a good backup there was a snippet for record slash detail screens

Unknown Speaker  17:09
you're over

Unknown Speaker  17:36
I think for now what I would

Matthias Miller  17:37
do under sections of fields we would have

Speaker 1  17:42
name which would be basically the city and a

Matthias Miller  17:49
small truck rate and a large truck rate

Unknown Speaker  18:03
we could conceivably

Unknown Speaker  18:14
I mean the other way we could do it

Unknown Speaker  18:24
okay, we could do that.

Matthias Miller  18:27
Or we could also have a shipping type list. If we think that we want to expand out into

Unknown Speaker  18:36
additional types

Unknown Speaker  18:54
are there gonna be any other shipping types though? Yeah, that's the question if,

Matthias Miller  18:59
if, if not, it's like that would maybe end

Unknown Speaker  19:03
up being more of a future thing if that would be.

Matthias Miller  19:07
That's fair. We could always switch it over to that if

Unknown Speaker  19:09
necessary. Okay.

Matthias Miller  19:13
So my comment can go in there we can put an overview in

Matthias Miller  19:30
it's easy to configure shipping rates

Unknown Speaker  19:32
is fine.

Unknown Speaker  19:50
What about your second one down here? Actually, that one would go in the same section. Um Well we wouldn't need on the order or somewhere we wouldn't be able to tie it to the yes

Matthias Miller  20:15
the shipping zone and then indicate whether it's a large truck or small truck

Unknown Speaker  20:27
see I'm gonna initially say under

Unknown Speaker  21:06
I'd probably do something like shipping zone

Matthias Miller  21:14
well except if it's is it literally tied

Unknown Speaker  21:17
to the city name

Speaker 1  21:29
and if so can we pull it off from the shipping ship to address

Unknown Speaker  21:46
that would be nice

Matthias Miller  21:48
yeah we'd be so really all we need is the shipping table or truck small truck probably

Unknown Speaker  21:57
right next to vehicle that right

Matthias Miller  22:01
well you know what, or the vehicle could define that

Speaker 1  22:19
because when they enter a vehicle is when it could be determined as to be a small truck or a large truck and then entering the vehicle ID or whatever it is, I forget exactly but order would then automatically turn it into sense. So then

Matthias Miller  22:39
But then the the only issue becomes

Unknown Speaker  22:45
here's the issue. If you reassign

Matthias Miller  22:50
a vehicle to a different if you just reassign an order to a different vehicle

Unknown Speaker  22:55
then you want

Matthias Miller  23:00
to avoid situations where you move it from a big vehicle to slow and so I would actually make the argument that you should do it above the vehicle and then the vehicle list be filtered based on whether it's a small truck big truck

Speaker 1  23:21
I would want high side sure

Unknown Speaker  23:36
published

Matthias Miller  23:39
trouble is to have big slash small

Unknown Speaker  23:45
did they have large we want to keep

Matthias Miller  23:48
our large I'm sorry alert small yeah yes.

Speaker 1  24:16
This would be an automatic field and when it said vehicle field or

Matthias Miller  24:25
it would be a as a vehicle was going to be would be a list

Unknown Speaker  24:30
is that not true?

Matthias Miller  24:52
I would put this as a to do IDD in the dev spec, saying consider whether it be Call should be a list and whether we should field truck size on the vehicle

Unknown Speaker  25:09
whether truck size should be a list or vehicle sorry whether vehicles should be a list

Unknown Speaker  25:22
and is

Unknown Speaker  25:37
it was was the second

Matthias Miller  25:50
and if trackside should be fielded on the vehicle

Matthias Miller  26:01
we can then filter vehicle based on the selected

Unknown Speaker  26:03
size

Unknown Speaker  26:20
good we're not thinking about it further than this we probably still wants

Matthias Miller  26:41
I think this could be a two to add

Unknown Speaker  26:48
up that ended that specs as well you

Matthias Miller  26:52
know, in the dev specs we want the top part to be relatively clean to for the sake of the class it's

Unknown Speaker  26:57
not a lot of clutter

Speaker 1  27:08
so Tim's kind of I can go through some of these and trying to remember where this is close to where we stopped with walk through if I remember right. If we got the whole way through actually, I guess we would have read comments here but we could

Matthias Miller  27:43
we might want to go through here and clean up some of these

Matthias Miller  27:59
they can just come parentheses after the order number.

Unknown Speaker  28:26
Hey I think we

Unknown Speaker  28:38
if it's Multiliners single line. multi line.

Matthias Miller  28:46
Okay. So I think we were I think we're going to change most of these over to memos then.

Speaker 1  28:53
Yeah, I don't know this. Yeah. Unless

Matthias Miller  29:07
Yeah, or even just just removing Tim's prefix and putting it in parentheses after Order notes. I think that's sufficient for what we need now.

Matthias Miller  29:23
And by the way, you can use Ctrl Shift V to paste without formatting if

Speaker 1  29:26
you went to Ctrl Shift. Okay. That's

Matthias Miller  29:39
a B, B as in

Unknown Speaker  29:41
of the victory. Yep.

Speaker 1  30:13
Don't I'm trying to remember with this list here he said maybe not everything would be needed but I wasn't entirely sure what would be needed and what that was this list so I would then

Unknown Speaker  30:38
change the

Matthias Miller  30:42
change change to say status droplist of order statuses and then move this one into a new create a new section for the order statuses list and perhaps move this screenshot over in their

Unknown Speaker  30:59
sub section of your lists or still no subsection of your list because it's just a simple simple list no no scene record.

Speaker 1  32:46
We would already have well that duplicated row we would already have the Insert row but right yes we would

Unknown Speaker  33:10
certain data think

Matthias Miller  33:19
I think we could basically have a copy from above

Speaker 1  33:21
Yeah I'm pretty sure that's basically what it did

Unknown Speaker  34:07
or

Speaker 1  34:12
do we want to have a preview or just have a convert to PDF button that then they would print it off as it should be something like it's going

Matthias Miller  34:25
to be a link and it should just directly open the PDF yes

Unknown Speaker  34:32
should order PDF Yeah.

Matthias Miller  34:38
Yeah or view I think sometimes we might say View Order PDF.

Speaker 1  34:41
That's yeah, that's right.

Unknown Speaker  35:05
What exactly did she call that? It would just be

Matthias Miller  35:13
it would have been linked to template

Unknown Speaker  35:17
okay

Matthias Miller  35:18
it's not really clear to them but it's clear to us

Speaker 1  35:21
right this would come off of the PDF and but I actually wouldn't even this right print doesn't isn't necessary invoice

Matthias Miller  35:44
this should be something like create QuickBooks invoice

Matthias Miller  36:08
delete order okay button so this yeah I mean I think the buttons probably self explanatory enough at

Unknown Speaker  36:18
this point

Matthias Miller  36:21
delete orders not really necessary

Unknown Speaker  36:31
no

Matthias Miller  36:41
yeah but this comes down to how are we going to do

Unknown Speaker  36:44
emails right

Unknown Speaker  37:05
so

Matthias Miller  37:13
I would just rename the button to link to new email

Unknown Speaker  37:24
where you could I'm sorry I think the practices

Matthias Miller  37:32
the parentheses are yes

Matthias Miller  37:40
and then the technicalities of how that happens can

Speaker 1  37:42
be handled separately do we want to save 10s note here down below for anything because of how they had it all prepared to do we not have the automatic way for that or that

Unknown Speaker  38:04
I think we can include that

Matthias Miller  38:05
you can just say this prepares the email with

Unknown Speaker  38:26
just a little bit of lag from

Speaker 1  38:34
not sure whether it's because I'm screen sharing on big monitor what sometimes it says Create disposition

Matthias Miller  38:46
now are we literally creating I mean I think this is basically view paperwork package which is a link to a template with all the different pieces is Wait new record tape

Unknown Speaker  38:58
no

Matthias Miller  39:08
we call it in new paperwork

Unknown Speaker  39:10
packet link to new record

Matthias Miller  39:29
do we know for sure that they want to use paperwork packet instead of

Unknown Speaker  39:32
disposition they

Speaker 1  39:44
I think they were okay with something like that. I remember right think they were

Matthias Miller  39:58
so then we should have a new one. Record tape renew record like all that stuff all the sub points that are probably should should go in with it new record for the

Unknown Speaker  40:09
paperwork packet slash disposition

Unknown Speaker  40:27
just a regular record type

Unknown Speaker  41:03
I see it It's.

Unknown Speaker  42:21
I can work on cleaning that one up some

Unknown Speaker  42:30
dropped about five minutes here then okay because we have to clear this from here yep I shouldn't I don't

Matthias Miller  42:43
wait if it's over there then yeah that's when

Unknown Speaker  42:48
health certificate is no longer

Matthias Miller  42:56
I think we should have an attachments

Unknown Speaker  42:59
RG

Matthias Miller  43:03
and we should model it after

Unknown Speaker  43:07
finding an example

Speaker 1  43:24
no attachments would be a good place to find a Transit Link

Unknown Speaker  43:39
tasks are images and we find ones with attachments

Unknown Speaker  43:55
searching ie to

Unknown Speaker  44:06
transmit images nope

Unknown Speaker  44:34
so

Matthias Miller  44:36
this might actually be something that would be worth adding a snippet for so that's what they have on the main screen and

Unknown Speaker  44:44
then on the child's screen it looks like that

Unknown Speaker  45:02
gotcha and

Matthias Miller  45:06
given the volume what I'm anticipating the volume of attachments that they want we're better off so this is this is these are for s3 attachments which are stored externally in Amazon's s3 service and so the cost of storage is substantially lower so if you if we've got a client that has a high volume of large attachments it's ideal so I would probably add something like like this for them

Unknown Speaker  45:33
okay

Unknown Speaker  45:42
how should I put that in? So, I would have a

Matthias Miller  45:51
somewhere here maybe under other charges attachments and then embedded spreadsheet of unlist out the columns and somewhere beside that first line note and add link to upload attachments

Speaker 1  46:07
like it would be it would be in it would be on the order record gotcha Oh doubt oh I see their charges so bad

Unknown Speaker  46:35
she's

Speaker 1  46:47
out debt the the attachments first of all and then it would be name

Matthias Miller  47:01
and then download link date time and Delete link

Unknown Speaker  47:12
which would confirm

Unknown Speaker  47:32
Yep

Matthias Miller  47:40
and then somewhere beside attachment something like maybe in the parentheses linked to add let me call an embedded spreadsheet of

Unknown Speaker  48:03
Yeah,

Matthias Miller  48:04
and then you can next the other attachments thing we've saved

Unknown Speaker  48:08
was doesn't matter and

Speaker 1  48:17
true that one that was one they used to go back and look at look at what he said they use that one a lot and I'm trying to remember exactly

Matthias Miller  48:38
words to agree with oh, this was

Speaker 1  48:42
this adds Yeah, the rows this add rows into the order automatically. They don't have to keep clicking like add row or something. Oh, got it. They have somebody who ordered who wants five female dogs, there's a certain way they can answer that in the quick entry and then it will make five rows in the order report. And then they

Matthias Miller  49:10
can fit in the serial filters down by matching. Okay,

Speaker 1  49:14
I mean, I think that's just that's pretty simple. We just need to spec out the

Matthias Miller  49:24
so that should be under the animal section. Like a maybe a quick entry, and then

Speaker 1  49:33
no way this section or the Yeah. It would be dancers dance, quick entry. And then just

Matthias Miller  49:54
just those fields and then the ad and explain how the add button works and then we need to make sure But the IDS up above is actually filtered based on order type

Unknown Speaker  50:07
male female and

Matthias Miller  50:11
order weight and so the order weight should actually go left of the ID number

Speaker 1  50:20
sorry, where are you saying that the ID number up above the green and the green

Matthias Miller  50:28
oh there the order wait should go before that and the ID number should be further filtered based on

Unknown Speaker  50:35
the male female selection in order we

Unknown Speaker  50:46
are faced

Matthias Miller  51:02
it would still be filtered by order type because you

Speaker 1  51:07
got mixing dogs and pigs. Right. Cool. And then

Matthias Miller  51:22
and then I think yeah, and then I think you can you can just check out the rest of the quick entry. Pretty straightforward just adding those rows and by doing that cool

Unknown Speaker  51:38
shit Yep,
