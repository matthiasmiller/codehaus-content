Matthias Miller  00:28
Hello. Hello, good morning.

Unknown Speaker  00:30
Good morning. Can you hear me okay?

Unknown Speaker  00:32
Thank you.

Matthias Miller  00:33
Okay, great.

Speaker 1  00:34
The entire town of Julesburg is getting its internet worked on so I am in overwhelmed with loud coffee shops.

Matthias Miller  00:41
Interesting.

Speaker 1  00:44
Like, I guess that's a good thing but that's a tiny town and the whole town is going to have intermittent internet outages all day long. Yes.

Speaker 1  00:52
Yep. Anyway, I was just typing to you I have a really tight schedule today because I've got a meeting at 930 to 1030 we have a meeting at 1030 You have meeting at 11 I just wanted to give you a heads up in case you worked through our 1030 Check in we could maybe check in this afternoon but I don't have a lot of flexibility this morning.

Matthias Miller  01:12
Well I don't Yeah, okay. I don't think there should be anything that would keep us from that but

Speaker 1  01:18
okay, no sounds just a heads up

Unknown Speaker  01:23
Sounds good

Matthias Miller  01:32
so we tend to do you see you're in now Ogallala

Unknown Speaker  01:34
Nebraska

Matthias Miller  01:37
Yes. I remember seeing signs for that

Unknown Speaker  01:43
never never stopped in the lovely

Matthias Miller  01:45
town of Ogallala we know that's right off of ad okay.

Speaker 1  01:49
It is right off the bat you probably gotten gas here if you've ever tried this way very mobile you have Yeah,

Matthias Miller  01:56
we need to see the exit or something. Ring a bell

Speaker 1  02:31
Do you want to spend time today reprioritizing tasks since it's the end of the month

Matthias Miller  02:39
we did a little bit of that last week I think okay, got a turn I'm not completely opposed. That another posted if we have time. I don't know what what's your how this morning was gonna go with everything that we've got on REITs

Speaker 1  02:52
right. Well, we had talked a little bit about going back we still got things from January. So he talks about maybe going back and re reprioritizing those but if today isn't a good day to do that that's fine.

Matthias Miller  03:08
Let's see how far I'm fine doing it. Let's see how far we can get before you need to drop Yeah.

Matthias Miller  04:27
Good morning Good morning. Good morning

Matthias Miller  04:36
all right. Am I thinking right Joel's already off on his travels or is that when does he leave? I kind of forget

Unknown Speaker  04:54
see?

Matthias Miller  04:58
out I think he's out already. Mark, have you talked to him about it? I can't remember. No.

Unknown Speaker  05:08
Not panda bears this time.

Speaker 2  05:09
He's a lot of time in Bangladesh. I don't know how many years was he over there? No, that's

Matthias Miller  05:20
Ellis was there for what was it? 15 Maybe? I'm not sure. Joelle. And I don't even know for sure it was five.

Unknown Speaker  05:32
I can't remember. Yeah, I

Speaker 2  05:36
was thinking about that. Sometimes we think we have challenges today. I'm always amazed like going to a foreign country starting to do software development would be challenges and getting the right word. Yes.

Matthias Miller  05:52
That's quite fortunate to find somebody who had been in the country had done business in the country for an expat who'd done business in that country for I don't know what it's been 2040 years long time. So it's not easy.

Speaker 2  06:15
What did you say they did connect with somebody that had been Oh ALLAH connections there are connections to somebody that connections okay.

Matthias Miller  06:26
Yeah, yeah. So they helped they helped get you know, get the business up and rolling and get all the stuff squared away so Yep.

Unknown Speaker  06:42
All right. Jumping in

Speaker 1  06:48
shall we do updates all right. Let's see document procedure for closing books for 2023 For mark the update there

Speaker 2  07:00
unfortunately no change there. Okay, I can't keep well yeah, can't keep seeing that much longer but

Speaker 1  07:08
that's fair. DREW This one is for you. This is the vendor invoice worn on missing information. We are waiting for an update last week so that you could look at it and make sure that it was working correctly I believe.

Unknown Speaker  07:25
Okay, is this this is not the duplication warning.

Matthias Miller  07:36
This is duplicate

Speaker 3  07:41
then we split those separately last time or something

Matthias Miller  07:50
the changes specifically were about duplicate warnings, duplications between checks and vendor invoices and some times that it was showing up the wrong way and some things like that. I think the title a little wrong, but that's what it was. Okay.

Speaker 3  08:05
Um, well, we need to bring this one back to the table today. So

Matthias Miller  08:15
you guys have it on the agenda? Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  08:18
Perfect. Okay,

Speaker 1  08:19
great. Let's see we will skip So Joel gave us an update on this when the email that it's still testing there's still testing work to be done likely some fine tuning, but he believes the reconciliation summary report is ready for Mark and your review Drew? So should I put this into the review bucket? Yes.

Unknown Speaker  08:47
Okay, well, I already have review for so. Okay.

Matthias Miller  08:50
That didn't take long. Yeah.

Speaker 1  08:53
Are we is it reviewed? Is it done then? Or what do we know? Okay,

Unknown Speaker  08:58
I'm gonna do half the export. No, okay.

Speaker 1  09:03
Gotcha. Okay, so for Matthias closing process for accounting impact,

Matthias Miller  09:10
no change. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  09:15
Blackout time for the Go Live plan.

Matthias Miller  09:19
We talked about that. Okay.

Speaker 1  09:27
drew the vendor invoices do not match accounting issue

Speaker 3  09:45
you had sent me a link, hadn't you? This is for this. Yes,

Matthias Miller  09:49
I had. I'm, I have a proposal here. If vendor invoices do not match accounting appropriately, we're going to end up with issues on reconcile. So can we just close it out?

Speaker 3  10:05
I would say so. I mean, so far everything has been acting correctly. Now, I've been dredging up a few things with this reconcile that I'm doing. So I would say close it out. And if something shows up, it'll probably be kind of some new tweak anyway, like, issue, but

Speaker 1  10:31
Okay, close it out about the 1099 summary report for Drew.

Speaker 3  10:38
Um, I'd say let's call it done. I looked at it. Like I think the function will work we have so few vendors that we have marked in the accounts that we have marked so I just did a couple and that seemed to work. So I think we're good to go.

Speaker 1  10:55
Sounds great. The bias, validate on deposit record that miscellaneous miscellaneous items account is different from the main deposit account. Last note was it was done it was waiting to be verified but it's still in your report for some reason.

Matthias Miller  11:08
I think it should be introduced court.

Unknown Speaker  11:12
I mean, move that.

Speaker 3  11:15
Um, that was there. Was there a change on that in the last update or something? Or not?

Matthias Miller  11:23
I was supposed to wait because

Speaker 3  11:30
like I had checked into it, I think it was last week or something. And it seemed to be working

Matthias Miller  11:37
No, I don't think there's any change I think if it was working we can close it out. Okay.

Speaker 1  11:45
All right. Another one for Drew Add Account subtype groupings for balance sheets. Did you I guess the last note was you and Matthias were going to get on and do a screen share walkthrough. Did you guys get that done?

Unknown Speaker  12:02
No. That's that on today's media. It's

Unknown Speaker  12:08
number three on the list. They're

Speaker 1  12:11
perfect. Okay, Matthias crashing credit card transactions reports. So I guess actually, we said that drew thought that was done. Maybe I just didn't close it out and done. We think this is done.

Matthias Miller  12:28
We think it's true. Is there anything else in the cash and credit card transactions report?

Unknown Speaker  12:37
Um, I haven't looked at it this week.

Speaker 2  12:40
But you sent me sent some reports from last week I sent those off or anything back but as far as we know they're done.

Matthias Miller  12:50
I'm happy to wait until considered done and wait for new issues. Yep. Sounds

Speaker 1  12:53
good. Good. For drew allow attaching statements to reconciles last week you said you hadn't gotten that far yet?

Speaker 3  13:01
Um, I have not tried it out. So no, change them.

Speaker 1  13:06
How about adding budget columns to income statement that was also in your court?

Unknown Speaker  13:12
No, James, I didn't look at it.

Speaker 2  13:13
Should we? Should we look at that. I think you have that on your list to look at.

Speaker 1  13:19
Yep, I do. Okay, great. Matthias the vendor and company mismatch I got your email that said you're waiting to hear from Josh. So are we are we waiting on this is it in Josh's court?

Matthias Miller  13:34
Josh and I talked about it I need to talk to we need to put it on the agenda for today.

Unknown Speaker  13:37
Okay

Speaker 1  13:43
all right. Matthias create a process for moving payments from one so to another. This was another one that should be closed. Driving urgency.

Matthias Miller  13:56
No, it's it needs to be done. No champion. Oban,

Speaker 1  14:01
gotcha. Account Balance diagnostic.

Matthias Miller  14:06
DREW I think this is in your court to play around with and see what's see if you're happy with it. We've got my I think I can't think of anything. I'm not aware of anything that I'm missing on it.

Unknown Speaker  14:23
This will update over the weekend.

Matthias Miller  14:26
We updated it last night.

Speaker 1  14:32
Better sections on income statements. So this was the one I'd sent you Matthias is the one that I emerged out. Is this done? Should we just close all Yes. Okay. I had a merging snafu that I needed to figure out so hopefully

Unknown Speaker  14:47
that's correct. Okay.

Speaker 1  14:51
Drew handling historically reconciled transactions

Speaker 3  14:57
um, Kind of. Okay, so Matthias was quick question here I created the dates and stuff for the reconciles that I had done in one of the ABC accounts. And I had had them like all the all the stuff from June, July, August, all of that had been reconciled. I created those dates and then went into one of those and everything was still there as not even clear Well, I don't know if it's everything, probably not everything but all a bunch of stuff is just all just new stuff.

Matthias Miller  15:46
Yeah, so what we need to do then once you've got the reconciles it's back in my court and I'll take all the old reconciles and timeout to your statements.

Speaker 3  15:56
Okay, there shouldn't be showing up that right like if it was previously reconcile it shouldn't be showing up as uncleared. Like there were there were a bunch of transactions that I made specifically to reckon to balance out and reconcile accounts, and I didn't see those. Those are the only ones that I would recall, you know, that I would know that particular transaction was supposed to be reconciled and now it's not. So I mean, it could be that this stuff is just new stuff that because of for whatever reason, it got pushed in and hadn't been before. Like I'd say that's highly likely there were something like 2500 transactions or so in the mainland bank account that hadn't been covered.

Matthias Miller  16:54
So those those should have gotten tied out to the 1979 or the 1980 reconcile

Speaker 3  17:03
well, they were all from like June to current because I was thinking 98 It was before that

Unknown Speaker  17:17
I don't know

Matthias Miller  17:19
Oh fair.

Matthias Miller  17:27
If you can can you see would you be able to send me a link to one specific transaction that is showing up in the wrong place and the statement that you expect it to be tied to or even just a transaction so if if I go into the if I go into the January for example, if I go into the January reconciliation

Matthias Miller  18:11
and I'm seeing ABC primary checking I'm seeing 500 transactions there is most of them are from January. Let's see there's some from there's one from January of last year November December but most of them are pretty recent.

Speaker 3  18:36
Yeah, that's I've reconciled everything out. I'm working on January so everything prior that actually at the bank is is reconciled if you open the I think it's the November reconcile that has all the stuff that I clear it out this time around okay

Matthias Miller  18:58
December doesn't have anything I mean sorry November doesn't have anything for ABC primary checking but December does Okay, no, here it is. It might be sober October to November I see it

Matthias Miller  19:17
and so it's showing the reconciled transactions here

Matthias Miller  19:34
Did you

Matthias Miller  19:57
did you go back and manually re reconcile the Is

Unknown Speaker  20:01
everything that's in there? Yeah, I mean that I

Matthias Miller  20:07
got it. I was going to once you create the statements to automatically assign them to the appropriate based on a hidden deepfield, assign them to the right statement for you. Sorry, I'm a little obtuse here. Let's can we add this to the agenda and circle back? And can you maybe walk me through? Exactly. Walk through this more specifically?

Speaker 1  20:42
All right, and move on to the next one. All right, so for drew the assist, check record add notes memo. That was pending an update at our last meeting. I think to be able to attach,

Unknown Speaker  20:55
yes. Is that working? Um, I don't know. So that should be live now. All right.

Matthias Miller  21:07
I think it's on our list is to look over this morning.

Speaker 1  21:15
Okay, Matthias show the ending bank or credit card balance for pending items.

Matthias Miller  21:20
I think I I think I had a question on this one. Okay. So let's add it to the agenda.

Unknown Speaker  21:30
About attachments for transactions if

Unknown Speaker  21:35
you succeed.

Speaker 1  21:51
I guess we're getting no this is. This is this is.

Matthias Miller  21:57
This is for Josh. It's a non urgent we should do it rainy day kind of thing.

Speaker 1  22:05
are we tracking that at all? At this point? In our meetings? If it's a Josh issue?

Matthias Miller  22:11
The main thing is at some point.

Matthias Miller  22:19
mean at some point we should just

Matthias Miller  22:25
Yeah, I don't know. Josh is buried with Artie with visualizer stuff right now. So Mark, what's the best way for things like? You know, bottom line is we have a whole bunch of attachments that we want to move to s3? How do you want to make sure whose responsibility is it to make sure that happens? And how do we want to do that?

Speaker 2  22:46
Well, what we've found to work best with Josh is, is to add it to our Wednesday morning. agenda I just added on the agenda and just keep it in front of him like those small tasks. That's that's typically how we handle them. Now I don't many of you. You have the details on what to do. But that would be my suggestion I just added to our list do reach out to you to do you have a bunch of attachments that you want to want him to set up to store in s3, rather than where they are now? Or they're taking up a lot of space or whatever, correct? Or how should I move all that project? What do they call the project?

Matthias Miller  23:42
Move attachments to s3? And it would be it's for checks deposits? Statements on the on the financial account? And I think that was Yeah, and accounting transactions, I believe.

Speaker 1  24:11
Is this gonna be related to the one right underneath it that says move attachments from vendor notes to attachments are G? Yes. Okay.

Matthias Miller  24:20
D 235. Let me go into

Matthias Miller  24:31
just see if there's anything else attached with deposit record transaction, vendor notes.

Unknown Speaker  24:41
Accounts

Matthias Miller  24:50
I'm not sure what the vendor notes are. What are those?

Unknown Speaker  24:57
There is a oh that might be for 1099

Matthias Miller  25:02
Oh on the contact record

Speaker 3  25:04
not 10 Nine I was Debbie nines but yeah on the contact record attached yeah

Matthias Miller  25:14
here let me let me just make I'll just shoot over an email with that list okay so we said and then you can you can integrate that into your so it's assist checks that says deposits accounting transactions financial accounts

Unknown Speaker  25:42
statements are financial

Matthias Miller  25:43
statements company and source contacts vendor

Matthias Miller  26:01
okay all right so let's move to mark you'll be getting that email so let's just close this out and this is within marks court

Speaker 1  26:23
okay is that going to apply also to then 90 to 35? Yes. Okay so

Unknown Speaker  26:35
generic anyone

Unknown Speaker  26:42
that great streamline vendor invoices needing payments

Matthias Miller  26:52
we pull up and find out what that actually was unless we have something else to go with it.

Unknown Speaker  26:58
Just to 33

Speaker 1  27:02
manual payment button is only visible when a single type is selected and the check button is visible for all payment types.

Matthias Miller  27:13
requires further discussion we can put it on the agenda and talk about and see if it's still a priority.

Speaker 1  27:22
vendor invoices validate against unlined to ledger accounts.

Matthias Miller  27:28
No change. I think it's probably a delegate to Jonathan

Speaker 1  27:33
and then duplication we which was an email

Speaker 1  27:45
finding numerous of these that are claiming to be duplicates in the reconcile module. Have you gotten a chance to look at this? Yeah.

Matthias Miller  27:55
I think it might be fixed, but I need to review it. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  28:00
Oops. Okay.

Speaker 1  28:08
Do you want to continue on through March here or you want to skip to new business?

Matthias Miller  28:16
We can skip to new new business I think. Okay.

Speaker 1  28:23
Okay, I have a couple of undated and I've got one down here. I don't know why these are undated. The test warning for duplicate transactions. Is this done? Is it being worked on? I guess what I say it's in Drew's court.

Matthias Miller  28:39
January issues with it. We're talking about it this morning. Okay.

Speaker 1  28:47
That might make sense. Okay. And then financial accounts and non RG attachment memo to reconcile child screen. It said it was linked to an item for drew that doesn't have an incident number and I couldn't figure out what that would be. So possibly that's me not being able to.

Matthias Miller  29:05
That one is either the Nanaji attention is when we have reconciliation is either Well, it's waiting on drew to burn it might be under I don't know if it's on the list for this morning. We could certainly add it on the list for this morning. Okay.

Speaker 1  29:17
Let me put that on then. If you guys figure that out. And then the new one we have is add payment ID for ACH payments 9532.

Matthias Miller  29:30
Josh, is

Unknown Speaker  29:31
that true? tracking it?

Unknown Speaker  29:32
We just did that? Yep. Perfect.

Speaker 2  29:34
Okay. Has Josh been noticed? Have you notified Josh I don't want to do that.

Matthias Miller  29:41
I let him know you guys want to do something. I left it in his court and told him he can let me know if you'd wants my help with anything. And so if you guys want to add it on your agenda, that would probably be ideal.

Speaker 1  30:00
Great so we are done going through for updates do you want to go through and look at reprioritizing any dates since we're right at the beginning of March here are you want to just get going on your agenda

Matthias Miller  30:29
think Mark you guys want to reset because want to reset priorities going into March make sure we're on the same page

Speaker 2  30:41
should we go through the review? Review the items first and then set priorities after that? It seems to me like we would have a better field or size of projects and what's urgent after that but

Matthias Miller  31:03
I'm good with that

Speaker 1  31:09
okay, I am texting you Matthias the link for the agenda. I think you guys can probably see what I just pulled up here I created an agenda tag so anything we talked about needing to be talked about is in the list for you reference that's helpful just texted you that Do you need anything else for me then right the moment I'm good I'll jump off let you guys get going. Have a good meeting thanks

Matthias Miller  31:38
all right drew did you want to you want to share your screen to go through this?

Unknown Speaker  32:06
So my left the screen out

Matthias Miller  32:11
was no I'm thinking the just going through the changes to review email unless you guys want to I don't know we can do this any number of ways

Unknown Speaker  32:28
we can

Matthias Miller  32:33
we can go through that and then cut back on anything that's not covered in the agenda

Unknown Speaker  32:45
Yeah, okay um yeah, I don't know which one would be better to go through

Unknown Speaker  32:56
go to go through the class

Speaker 3  33:02
I have not yet to look over this thing very much.

Matthias Miller  33:08
Okay, reconciliation report we've got on the agenda look at later budget reports we have on the agenda look at later I booked to defer that if you want to pull up the account balance diagnostic at least poke your head in there

Matthias Miller  33:30
are the.

Matthias Miller  34:39
So, I don't know how much there's still a gap. If you scroll down to that in between space where we're starting to see issues here. I think most of this stuff some of these we'd looked at last week. I think that one is one that we'd looked at. But I mean bottom line is that you should be seeing a lot less is in this middle space as far as and so I don't know if you want to look at these

Speaker 3  35:11
well like like these all right here, those would all just be awaiting payment right the 20th to like this 145

Speaker 3  35:53
Why is this one balanced here but not hear me

Unknown Speaker  36:04
right is it balancing

Matthias Miller  36:12
Alright, so this is sixteens 6584 Let me show the

Speaker 2  36:26
what does this report show like everything that's on here

Speaker 3  36:31
so it shows this is going into accounts payable basically and then the debit would be going out for that item. So like, here, it doesn't go in and out the same everything

Speaker 2  36:45
that's listed here is there's something wrong with it. Not

Speaker 3  36:49
necessarily like like these, you know, they just need paid down here you know, this is pretty much mean it came in and went out because they should have all the matching stuff in there. So and then these like those are probably credits that are improperly brought up those are but so just these ones here that don't match that need some done with them.

Speaker 2  37:22
What are the debits towards the top? Those are also in corrected white? Um

Unknown Speaker  37:31
Are those? Oh

Speaker 3  37:32
no, these are all early ones that got paid out after we brought over but they didn't go in like, because of the timeframe they bridge the gap. Now, the ease

Unknown Speaker  37:48
they would have had to go into

Speaker 3  37:57
Oh, this is one of those vendor and company being mismatching. Go ahead.

Unknown Speaker  38:07
We were looking at one specifically. I think it was

Matthias Miller  38:13
so that one I wonder we need a little better tool for you guys to see what's going on under the hood as far as what's generating those totals

Speaker 3  38:28
maybe that's good. So how is the second part of this attached to the first connected to the first part? Like this 1060 to number

Matthias Miller  38:41
1062 Okay, let me let me compare this. Well. Three, five to eight, nine

Matthias Miller  39:01
credit 10 3737 those are those are both there. The one we have a debit. Pretend 37 and a debit pretend 37 We have two credits. For AP pretend 37 That takes care of the 1030 sevens. The 1062 1060

Speaker 4  39:28
to

Matthias Miller  39:35
rehab but we only have one 395

Speaker 3  39:52
Why is that? Oh is the 395 a credit?

Matthias Miller  39:57
It is a credit but why is it not? Why is the debit for the 395? The reason is probably

Speaker 3  40:08
one of those tail chasing ones was my gas.

Matthias Miller  40:14
That's good. Take a look. So we go into the check. Yeah, yep. It's credit to AP. Yeah.

Speaker 3  40:27
Yeah, there's probably the best thing would just be go over there to that. That page, fix everything there and then come back and see if there's anything left. That's no problem.

Matthias Miller  40:41
Do you? Do you have any good way to pull any

Unknown Speaker  40:45
pull all

Matthias Miller  40:47
non Pio expenses tied to a certain GL account?

Speaker 3  40:51
Well, you sent me that link to the, to those things called tail chasing knots. It's specifically for that. And I need to talk with, with Mark and Aaron about whether we do the quick fix or whether we actually fix those things appropriate. I mean, correctly, sir.

Matthias Miller  41:18
All right. Got it. Okay, so that's

Speaker 3  41:20
probably good. I would say this is working. That's where we're gonna have to go to start solving some of our problems, I guess, are the

Speaker 2  41:32
credits that are posted to accounts payable improperly instead of to the expense account. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  41:43
All right. So that's that. vendor invoices, fixes the duplicate warning invoice warning that's already on the agenda. I vote to skip that on the checks I think we had talked about the invoice number already being on there previously, is that right?

Speaker 3  42:03
Well, we talked about it I never actually looked at a printout to see if it's there or not.

Speaker 2  42:08
At some point that we'll look at that because that was something that Leanne brought up from vendor questions. Now but what what what happens when there's there's account numbers, what happens when there's invoice numbers? What happened? They're both like what what shows up on but what does what does the supplier see? Or the person we're paying?

Speaker 3  42:37
They're supposed to see everything. If they're looking at their checks

Matthias Miller  42:42
to pull up a do check scan and just pull it up and we can take a look at it. Yeah.

Speaker 2  42:49
You didn't pay? I know one specific one was energyunited in biostructure.

Unknown Speaker  42:56
Well, um,

Speaker 2  42:59
I see they've added the account number no vendor so

Speaker 3  43:04
well, yeah, I mean, like so Republic Services. Um, I'll just pull up this one. So we, I took the account number out because whatever you put on the vendor account number will print on every single check. And there's two different Republic Services accounts. And so the confusion that was there is we sent in invoices on the same check for that for two different accounts with only one account number listed. So they said Shall we take the money and apply it to the other account? Like the invoice sets because both invoice numbers are listed on the textile so all the only response that was needed was Yes, please do that.

Speaker 2  43:59
So they issued to what their electric provider Yeah, and they issue they actually issue invoices. Obviously, yes, so we paid off of the invoices but because we probably up to like two accounts one where production is and another were at a sales lot or Yeah. So one company but we have two accounts with them. Mm hmm.

Speaker 3  44:26
So yeah, we have that invoice number thing there. So this is what they would see the check stub and they would see the memo would go right here and let's go find one that has has that on there. Also

Speaker 2  44:36
you just completely took the account number off so now you can still pay right

Speaker 3  44:40
so we can I can pay both of them and they just have to go by the invoice. No.

Speaker 2  44:45
Was that response sent to them first time like from Yeah, we got it all straightened out. So now they'll look at this and say oh, yeah, good to go. So this invoice so long to Why don't we just consolidate everything into one account?

Speaker 3  45:02
I'm not sure. I mean, beggar that's that's some

Speaker 3  45:15
Yeah. Whew. I think maybe this apple outdoors, actually, yeah, we do have that on. So here's the account number.

Speaker 3  45:36
So there's the account number on you so thoroughly. And if the account number is listed, yes, it'll show up on the check, they'll be able to see it, they'll also be able to see any invoices that are paid, if it's an invoice credit, that will also be listed as negative amount. So like that, they can see all that stuff. The only problem is when we have multiple accounts at one vendor, and we try to put that and we're trying to put one of the accounts. That's what

Speaker 2  46:07
doesn't. But as it sits, as it stands today, we don't know of any like that other than, you know, the Republic service, which I think we should look at some of these on call with them today, just to me, make sure they fully understand this because So what happens if checks printed mail to stop is mailed along like it's all one piece of paper. And they can

Speaker 3  46:31
Yeah, I mean, these these companies that are emailing them wondering about their, their invoice, thus and thus, you know, like, I mean, those people are not doing their homework because because they received the stuff that said what it's for. They're just, they're just not they probably have one person that that puts them in, in the in the bank and doesn't do the proper thing with the check stub or something. And so an expert comes along and says Oh, this isn't paid. Um, but that's pretty much all for that question. Right.

Matthias Miller  47:19
Get to the duplicates, then. Well, actually, you want to doesn't

Unknown Speaker  47:22
seem to be here yet.

Speaker 3  47:30
Um, to be able to, like, if they send me a handwritten check, or something, then we can just attach it right here.

Matthias Miller  47:39
hit the edit button.

Unknown Speaker  47:43
Oh, maybe it is within

Unknown Speaker  47:46
maybe Hey, there it is.

Unknown Speaker  47:52
There it is. I'm gonna stab something

Unknown Speaker  47:57
the What have you been doing up until now we'll get written checks

Speaker 3  48:04
Well, if I get them I just haven't been attaching anything. Now. He gets a bunch of them and then they write they're writing invoices and saying it's a paid invoice and then they attach them there. So I can do the same thing

Unknown Speaker  48:27
just do the drags okay great

Matthias Miller  48:51
department should also have attachments now.

Unknown Speaker  48:54
Yeah

Unknown Speaker  49:15
okay,

Speaker 2  49:15
so it already has an attached Oh, okay.

Matthias Miller  49:21
And it really is we had that.

Speaker 3  49:23
Yeah, that's been Oh, yeah. That's been on for

Speaker 2  49:26
what what do you think? I mean, there's probably a

Speaker 3  49:29
deposit sheet. Yeah. This particular

Speaker 2  49:34
good this is from this is actually from a sales sales location. depositing a check into deposit on with Chase Bank

Speaker 2  49:53
secondary Chase. Okay, well, on the account, that account number is listed. Wow. That's what they still have to pick them up. This

Unknown Speaker  50:00
sounds like the right button

Unknown Speaker  50:04
ah okay

Matthias Miller  50:07
all right well actually means that okay, was there any other well the I think that's it then

Unknown Speaker  50:21
let's see

Unknown Speaker  50:32
what is this accounting transactions by contact?

Unknown Speaker  50:35
Oh, this was for the Yeah, I think this one we already closed out the

Speaker 2  50:43
uncategorized No, there was no

Speaker 3  50:46
this was the use case for this is the subcontractor reporting

Unknown Speaker  51:09
those were not applied

Unknown Speaker  51:23
Yes, we might as well

Speaker 2  51:35
need to enjoy the day, it's like an extra day that we get only once every four years.

Speaker 3  51:41
So yeah, I mean, that that one's good to go. I need to come up with other uses and tweaks and needs for it.

Speaker 2  51:54
But we could use this we could use this as might be a better use case for for gay better design metals. For that was like a, a detailed income statement by contacts like, this would be bad. I think we, I mean, you like, multiple, a whole bunch of account?

Speaker 3  52:26
Yeah, that would work. But it would I mean, it would do like that, you know, where it has whatever account that vendor. So like, his accounts would not be grouped at all, and

Speaker 2  52:41
goes on either their, their group by event by their other exactly like this. So that Yeah,

Speaker 3  52:46
yeah. Anything, anything that you actually want to be grouped by vendor?

Speaker 2  52:50
So to do that, Matthias what what we'd want to do is we'd say we want to say show me all So Drew manually selected three different accounts here what we'd want to do, there would be one way of doing it would be saying, Give me all of the account between the numbers of 56 like the prefix numbers 56 and 85 or 56 and 75 I mean, we can do the same thing by just click click click on a bunch of them but is there an easy way that

Speaker 3  53:33
you could do could you set up some things to just say all of so and so subtype or something you know, like you know, I want I want all the I want all the sales expense subtype or women all of this subtype Well, that's what

Speaker 2  53:53
happens if you go back to where you don't even have to parent accounts here where you could do that

Matthias Miller  54:01
yeah, no, we're not doesn't look like we're including parent accounts. We could also include parent accounts and just automatically when you select a parenting account automatically include child accounts

Unknown Speaker  54:15
that would that would that would work

Speaker 3  54:27
the front I mean that wouldn't near hit everything. Like it's up to go individually like this one, this one this one? I

Matthias Miller  54:36
mean, if you guys want by type and selecting account type and account subtype we certainly can. I don't have a problem with that.

Speaker 3  54:45
I mean, I wouldn't be raised this at leisure in the selection thing there and just give another select by Yeah, be selected by some type. I think that would work. Well.

Speaker 2  54:59
It's It's basically just all the operating expenses everything below COGS is what we'd want to see. So I don't know Matthias I mean it's one of those things where I almost feel like if you could just create a what do you call it like a user report we could try that and make sure that that gives us what we're looking for maybe it's just as easy through to just go through and

Unknown Speaker  55:35
we'll get the same thing was a lot of clicking Yeah.

Matthias Miller  55:39
I mean, it's not

Speaker 4  55:46
it's not that bad to add this so

Speaker 2  55:54
when you say add parent accounts you would you would add all levels of parent accounts like operating expenses and then underneath that sales expenses marketing and no

Matthias Miller  56:05
I'm I'm sorry I'm in it might be just as easy if you guys want this to do to to to allow you to select select the subtypes

Speaker 2  56:21
and the subject would be like what sales marketing now what is what these dates indicate? What the invoice date

Matthias Miller  56:34
transaction date so the payment date

Unknown Speaker  56:46
so

Unknown Speaker  56:53
so Is that

Unknown Speaker  57:02
Is that what it should be with Pan vendors I mean like these guys are subcontractors. I mean I guess it doesn't matter if you always are doing the same phone

Speaker 2  57:16
so if we're looking for the last date, the L horn 202 That was when the payment was was when it was paid right? It's not when the invoice sort of showed up correct you know what I don't think this this report but well

Matthias Miller  57:39
no, hang on. Hang on. Hang on hang on not true. This will show up under AP so yeah, it's the invoice date.

Speaker 2  57:49
So two two was the day of the invoice date the day it hit this account

Matthias Miller  57:53
the day had this account which if you go into the US source record Yeah, is correct and was paid on the sixth Yeah, no, that's right. Don't

Unknown Speaker  58:05
do that. I mean, how big a project is that

Matthias Miller  58:12
while you guys were poking around I got 80% of the way done completely

Speaker 2  58:20
Is that something you could just create for now as a user report for Drew if it we like it we can start again good

Unknown Speaker  58:44
right

Matthias Miller  58:52
place it's me

Matthias Miller  59:02
right Uncategorized expense to lean

Unknown Speaker  59:21
all because it's all in a

Unknown Speaker  59:22
different account.

Unknown Speaker  59:26
So now you can really see who's

Unknown Speaker  59:30
now we're gonna see what we need to clean up today yet

Speaker 2  59:36
for affordable this is really all we have to clean up for today. On affordable Yeah, this

Unknown Speaker  59:40
is a lot of work.

Matthias Miller  59:43
That's giving you your extra day.

Unknown Speaker  59:46
Yes, you may break down was protocol and

Speaker 3  59:49
voice we need three three leap days. Actually, we don't have to clean all this up because some of this is a bunch of this is actually your let me put a little Let me put our true date

Speaker 3  1:00:15
there's so we're working right away but now I think that'll work. I mean that gives us some totals people can see that stuff then. Yeah.

Speaker 2  1:00:31
Oh the deposits from your Cobra payments

Speaker 3  1:00:36
right right. Got it like those yeah those truck payments

Unknown Speaker  1:00:41
on that one

Unknown Speaker  1:00:45
oh yeah that's

Unknown Speaker  1:00:49
yeah yeah we've moved over

Speaker 3  1:00:52
so yeah, I know not nothing difficult it just takes too long so yeah, that sounds good it's just work like

Unknown Speaker  1:01:05
cash or credit card

Speaker 3  1:01:26
okay this is yeah got it wait didn't we used to be able to Oh no. All right, this one

Unknown Speaker  1:01:39
okay so no way yeah

Unknown Speaker  1:02:19
now there was something with the

Unknown Speaker  1:02:24
we had needed to exclude one credit

Speaker 3  1:02:31
right. Oh, that is in shed time. Yes. Or

Speaker 2  1:02:39
it was somewhere so this one had no trend. Okay, we've seen this one before already. I don't Yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:02:47
I think that's route

Speaker 2  1:02:51
so you have three points here show account names for transfers, which we're seeing that on the transfer out recap one transfers into transferring transfer out we see that not here but it like said time has one or has has both transfers in and out and then include equity accounts, which don't know if there's an A I know from running all we can open up the let me open up the day where there were some owner distributions I don't think there are any here but

Unknown Speaker  1:03:33
most likely they would be transfers

Unknown Speaker  1:03:34
out

Speaker 2  1:03:53
this person over the transfers in was that sweet was now

Unknown Speaker  1:04:00
which I can exclude the sweet

Unknown Speaker  1:04:04
tramp? Yeah, there's the out. So yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:08
Income tax. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:12
Good. Yeah. We're getting there.

Speaker 2  1:04:17
So as you were working on that accounting transactions by contact report where we could do subtypes is that you have that final 20% down where you want to,

Matthias Miller  1:04:32
might need to

Unknown Speaker  1:04:34
keep going on others.

Matthias Miller  1:04:37
When we keep going in circles, we can maybe circle back at that at that one.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:53
Just make a note here.

Matthias Miller  1:04:56
Was that is that all I had on that list?

Speaker 2  1:04:58
Yes, it was Just a note you want to we need to stop at 12 sharp to get ready for 1230 with Dwayne in the end? Sure. Should I think we'd say regroup at one again. So

Matthias Miller  1:05:16
works for me. Okay, so jumping over to your agenda mark. Dealer commissions?

Speaker 2  1:05:32
Do we have time and space to do it in his rent or not? It's all however it's working, like spreadsheets do. So that's why we wanted to ask I mean, it's not extremely urgent, because we're not. While it would be nice to it just requires a lot of manual work and maintenance. But we've been using this for a while already. So how does your workload? Look? As far as accounting? What I'm saying is, most of this accounting stuff is, is prioritized ahead of that. So if we have if you have feel like you have capacity, then we should do it. If not, it can wait. Well, I feel like

Matthias Miller  1:06:29
I have a little hard time judging, it feels like we've got all kinds of loose ends that could either be really simple to tie out, tie out or could like the account balance diagnostic, well, maybe if we clean up all the tail eating things, it'll be we can we can put that to rest. Or it could just be way bigger than we ordered, you know, company A vendor mismatch. issue. Well, that could also end up being quite simple. Or maybe there's some things that balloon, so I feel like I don't have a good sense for it, I think there's still a I don't think it's off the table, we're getting it done this sprint. You it might be worth, if I do have some time, it might be worth just doing a walkthrough with Dwayne on it. And, and getting getting an idea for what it is. And then also just seeing if it's something that Jonathan can can code. Because that would I suspect over the next couple of weeks when Ellis and Joel are in Bangladesh, or he might have some more availability, I don't know for sure what his schedule is like. But I

Speaker 2  1:07:36
mean, the other thing I just thought of as we were talking is the like closing books for free, like how much time is that going to take? So we have no idea. I mean, for that reason, I would almost suggest we push it back for two weeks. And then we look at where we're at. Dwayne just met the other day. So if you're good with that, I'm going to make a note on my calendar to look at it again in two weeks. See? Which would be the

Unknown Speaker  1:08:08
14th Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:15
So the next one, go ahead.

Matthias Miller  1:08:20
So in answer to your next one, if I can just jump in the short short answer is you can do whatever you want to and as long as you don't go back past a closed period and don't do this for something that's already reconciled. I can't see any possible problem

Speaker 2  1:08:48
well, understand I'm a little Sure Can we take a quick look at that one specifically and see, see I had thought there's a way that you can market well maybe does the same thing. Market uncheck the complete button and update it like what happened here is is on the Salesforce Ed invoicing report, you made it very easy for people to edit those dates if they're wrong. This one got missed. We wanted to try and fix it Dwayne said I have no way to fix it. I thought there is a way that he could have fixed it and

Matthias Miller  1:09:25
I want to try it. Again it is

Unknown Speaker  1:09:32
I thought we'd done it at least once before

Matthias Miller  1:09:34
already or let's see you mark it as not complete. You know

Speaker 3  1:09:44
you have to save your save your change to not complete

Unknown Speaker  1:09:56
No,

Matthias Miller  1:09:58
one for date. Let me go take Look at

Matthias Miller  1:10:06
just needing vendor in an invoice sales orders. That's not easy

Speaker 2  1:10:23
sales orders needing invoicing. Yeah, your sales? The third one this one?

Matthias Miller  1:10:33
Sorry, which one was let's see, this is gross India, q4

Unknown Speaker  1:10:37
four zero to 162.

Matthias Miller  1:10:42
We don't have a way to get through there.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:43
Um,

Matthias Miller  1:10:48
let me, let me put my head in here a little bit. And that's Oh, well,

Speaker 2  1:10:55
Mike, my biggest concern is that we allow it to be edited without like, as long as we can make so that it alerts you or it stops you from editing a date where it would impact close periods already.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:19
Right.

Speaker 3  1:11:29
Yeah, about what dictates a closed period. Because 2023 is a closed period. But we've paid sales tax on January already. And they want to put something back into January. That's not going to work well. Like we would need to, on the sales side, we would need to close each month as we do the sales tax.

Speaker 2  1:12:04
Thank well. I think that on the sales tax specifically, I think Matthias was planning to look at that as look at the the transactions of what have we paid on sales tax in this period? And what should we have paid?

Matthias Miller  1:12:30
Okay, right, so so we could we could then backfill for prior if we make an adjustment to a prior period, the next month, we would just handle that appropriate number of really, somehow

Speaker 3  1:12:42
they're in their credit, or, or something,

Unknown Speaker  1:12:46
something like that?

Speaker 2  1:12:50
Well, how should I mean, this is going to come up from time to time when we say, oh, we need to go and actually invoice this one. As of a different date.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:03
Can you

Matthias Miller  1:13:09
I can, I'm just for this.

Speaker 3  1:13:12
I'm fine with that if we could, in in that sales tax report, have something that gives us changes since last period or something. So if somebody if somebody moved something in or out of a previous period, it would show up as

Speaker 3  1:13:41
basically just that we would be recorded just how it's recorded that there was a change made this month in this period. That changes something from last period. And so we are taking the tax this period, like just so there's documentation of the shuffle. I just hate to I don't know if there's audits or not, but to go back through records and then have have 80% of your mind's the amount you filed does not match any sort of records that you can now produce.

Matthias Miller  1:14:27
Do do we? How much of this problem needs to be solved today besides this particular sales order, but

Speaker 2  1:14:34
this one doesn't need to be it's fine whether it's I mean this is

Unknown Speaker  1:14:43
I'd say it's a minor issue.

Matthias Miller  1:14:51
I'm concerned about if you really have to move something

Matthias Miller  1:15:03
Okay, this one, I can easily move to a different date. Just if we if we want to, I think I can pretty easily do this.

Speaker 2  1:15:11
This one specifically, it's not a big deal, whether it's $50, it doesn't really matter which. But but keep going your thought on your concern that well keep keep going with your thoughts. Curious what you're going to say? Well,

Matthias Miller  1:15:32
I think okay, here is my, this was my, that was forgot I had this thought, but this is my brainchild on how to make locking these things down super, super, super, super, super, super simple. And then it goes like this. If you have a sales order, and it's tied out to accounting, and any of its any of its accounts, it is part of a record, any of its line items are reconciled. This is frozen, you can't do anything with it. And you have to have a objection that we're talking about this, we give a I am the accounting dictator, and I can do whatever I want to. And Drew has this permission, and nobody else does, basically. And if he looks at this, and he says, Okay, fine, like this is justifiable, I can document it, I can defend it in an audit, we should go do this fix, then he can go bypass that and go make whatever changes he wants to. But for anybody else, you can't. And so the way you lock down sales tax is you go run sales tax, and then you change your sales tax liability account to be irreconcilable account. And you reconcile that account, which then locks down all associated transactions with it?

Speaker 3  1:17:07
Well, I haven't needed to change anything yet. So so far, that sounds like good logic. Okay.

Speaker 2  1:17:14
And then, following that logic, you would do the same thing. If you need to edit. In this case, once we get to that point, Drew would have to be the one changing the invoice date on this.

Matthias Miller  1:17:27
Correct?

Speaker 2  1:17:29
i Good. I mean, is that where are we at on that? Is that? Our but

Matthias Miller  1:17:42
it's on the list of things. I mean, we talked about locking down close transactions, I think we need to get it done before we shoot ourselves in the foot. I had been dragging my feet because it felt like it was going to be really complicated. But I don't think it's actually that bad. I think I think probably what needs to happen is we need to put together a proposal for this and figure out what parts of a sales order what parts of the record need to be able to be modified after it's been reconciled. Then which parts do we do we have to lock down. So it does need some definition there. But

Speaker 3  1:18:26
one that also keeps something from being moved out of a particular period but does not keep something from being moved into that particular period.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:38
Well, that's fair. Good point.

Matthias Miller  1:18:48
Well

Matthias Miller  1:18:54
we could we could lock it down. Similarly, if you make a change, and it's going to result in it being prior to the statement ending date of the last reconciled statement, date for that month, or for that account. Then we block it.

Speaker 3  1:19:27
There we'll come back to that, that being wrecked, like that period being reconciled, ideally,

Matthias Miller  1:19:34
it's yes. And not necessarily strictly to a closure idea.

Speaker 2  1:19:42
What would you find a period being reconciled would be the primary bank account being reconciled?

Matthias Miller  1:19:50
It would be any account that you choose to reconcile. So for sales tax, we would actually leave Literally reconcile the sales tax liability account.

Speaker 2  1:20:08
I see. So if it would, it would, it would not allow any changes that would change and already reconciled account for that period. So like sales tax liability, or the primary checking or the credit card account? Or let's say you, hey, every you had all of your reconciles, done except the secondary credit card for some reason, this change would only affect the secondary checking, or credit card account or whatever it would allow you to make that.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:43
Yeah. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:52
Seems like a plan. To me. Yeah.

Speaker 3  1:20:56
I mean, I would still want, I would, seems to me, I would still want that broad picture closed down 23 for the previous brilliant idea, because, you know, we can start shifting equity accounts that aren't reconciled. I don't know there'd be a bunch of stuff like that, that could still gonna shuffle around the test the only closing right.

Matthias Miller  1:21:31
So, we could also so in addition to that reconcile thing, we could also do anything that we we could also respect accounting, closing dates and transaction locking dates.

Speaker 3  1:21:56
So the transaction locking thing would be the thing based on a visa.

Matthias Miller  1:22:07
So you would you have to you have to pass through three checks. One, all the accounts have to not be reconciled. And the and if there's an and the new transaction date, if it changes has to be after all accounts, latest reconciled date. So that's check one. Reconciliation, check, check two is accounting close check. So it has to be after the latest accounting close. Check three is it has to be after the latest transaction lock date.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:52
Why would it have to be that?

Matthias Miller  1:22:56
Well, that gives you a way to lock down the 2023. That way nothing in prior to 2023 can be modified. You'd use your accounting closing dates to lock down 2023. And how would you

Speaker 3  1:23:15
understand the first two the third one you said it has to be after the last modified date.

Matthias Miller  1:23:21
There's a transaction locking date. I don't know exactly how this works. But I think it's similar to a closing date except it's not literally a close it's just a freeze. So you close the numbers. Now we could just completely bypass this and you could say after the seventh of the month or after I do reconcile and sales tax I go lock all all historical transactions and we could completely ignore the the reconcile stuff which would simplify things. And you guys would just rely on accounting closing dates and transaction blocking dates to keep people from making changes that shouldn't.

Speaker 2  1:24:11
That seems like it would be a cleaner blob. What is the difference between an accounting closed date and a transaction locking date?

Matthias Miller  1:24:27
My understanding is the accounting closed process would transfer everything into retained earnings and zero out the expense accounts.

Unknown Speaker  1:24:35
Oh, so that's the revenue annually.

Matthias Miller  1:24:38
Right?

Speaker 2  1:24:39
What are the locking date you probably try to do monthly or

Matthias Miller  1:24:44
quarterly? Something like Yeah.

Speaker 2  1:24:48
So they do the same thing with the addition on the accounting closing date with zero out all the bad but the income statement accounts and would transfer all retained earnings or to the equity accounts, the right that That is

Matthias Miller  1:25:08
my understanding Yes.

Speaker 3  1:25:14
Now when you say we would file our tax, and then we would phrase that period, does that mean? Or everything would be pros? Or does that mean only?

Matthias Miller  1:25:29
Well, this is accounting company wide.

Unknown Speaker  1:25:33
Yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:25:35
Now, the other thing I could, okay, so.

Matthias Miller  1:25:44
So we could also just do the number one and number two and completely ignore transaction locking? Well, I think we should respect transaction locking dates, even if you guys don't end up using it. So maybe you'll just never use it. But I think we should still respect it. I think it would make sense to.

Speaker 2  1:26:05
But I think we should get as messy as it seems right now. Like if, if you don't, what you don't want from a from, I guess a management perspective is have numbers that always ship like you're at some point, you have to have numbers that you can stand on say, Well, this month is closed, this is what happened, this is why it happened. And then if you find mistakes, and you just I don't know if like let's say, Oh, we did an invoice for these 20 buildings for jets direct, and they should have been on last month. Wow. Okay, they just have to go on this month, I think is the

Speaker 3  1:26:39
thing that I don't, that I am hesitant to only use that is that it kind of forces you to be done with everything by the time you have to pay sales tax. Like you gotta make sure you have all your equity stuff in order, you got to make sure. Like, I liked the idea of being able to say, Okay, we did sales tax, that part of it is now froze. And I can work on the rest of my things. I do like that option. So whereas it seems like if you have the only the freeze all or none is all you have, then it's kind of like we make all the deadlines be the same day. Right?

Speaker 2  1:27:26
Oh, so if we respect the the account, like let's say you do your sales tax, say by the salmon for the month, and then you reconcile that account, then that disallows any changes that affect that. And then you lock the transaction date on the 15th or whatever.

Unknown Speaker  1:27:47
Right? Right.

Matthias Miller  1:27:49
Right. So on the eighth, you could change an STI or a wholesale invoice, because it doesn't affect Well, yeah, because it doesn't affect sales tax. And then on the 15th, you can't modify data anymore, because it's close to you. There. It's not a closed period. It's a locked. Transactions are locked.

Speaker 2  1:28:09
Yeah. And on the 15th, you can say, I now want to lock everything from for the previous month. Like it's not, you don't it's not like from the field

Unknown Speaker  1:28:24
that you're wanting to get to look at the

Speaker 2  1:28:26
date in history. Yeah, this seems like a breath of fresh air from what we have been doing in the past like QuickBooks 23 It was like things always continued to move a little bit. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:28:54
All right. Well, that gives me a you asked where we're at on it. I haven't started on it. I think this is another question of priorities. I do think this is one of those things that makes us all hold our breath a little bit until it's actually done. But we can in the interest of time, perhaps. Well, I think we should look at it in the broader context. And we are one minute away from keeping you too long.

Speaker 2  1:29:23
Good. I think we plan to regroup at one and no, that's going to run us a little tight. Could we do 130 Or does that how does that

Matthias Miller  1:29:34
it's fine by me. I'll switch it to 131 3132

Speaker 2  1:29:35
I think we have most of the afternoon open then.

Matthias Miller  1:29:44
Yeah, I do have another three o'clock Eastern.

Unknown Speaker  1:29:48
Okay. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:29:55
Um, I might be able to, to, I would be actually be able if you guys have one take more time tomorrow afternoon. Late afternoon I might have some some options as well. Is that

Speaker 2  1:30:08
tomorrow? Yeah, it won't. That won't work for me but

Unknown Speaker  1:30:14
you do possibly

Matthias Miller  1:30:24
All right. Sounds good.
