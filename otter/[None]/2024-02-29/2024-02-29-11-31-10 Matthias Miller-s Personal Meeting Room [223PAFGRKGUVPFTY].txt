Unknown Speaker  02:23
Yes. Ultras girl good

Matthias Miller  02:32
y'all got got a marathon day

Unknown Speaker  02:34
yeah

Speaker 1  02:44
so the balance sheets Do you have that open? Or how do you want to go about that?

Matthias Miller  02:53
Let me go pull up Mark's list they

Unknown Speaker  02:56
sent over

Matthias Miller  03:05
Okay, so oh you're wanting to

Unknown Speaker  03:10
whatever the sub was you were wanting to go over

Matthias Miller  03:13
Yeah, let me the

Unknown Speaker  03:17
sub grouping or something like

Matthias Miller  03:18
that. Yeah, why don't you actually share your screen if you don't mind and then it'll maybe help a little bit just keeping your going at top of mind for you

Matthias Miller  03:40
know what this is not going to be I'm going to make a custom chart of accounts report for you because it's just gonna be obnoxious if we do it any other way.

Unknown Speaker  04:02
Account roll

Unknown Speaker  04:27
What am I doing wrong?

Matthias Miller  04:36
Right, because it's not a balance sheet roll

Unknown Speaker  04:44
when I'm confused

Unknown Speaker  05:27
Yeah,

Matthias Miller  05:27
everybody okay, if you want to actually go into the account subtypes report

Unknown Speaker  05:41
oops. And then well

Matthias Miller  05:53
maybe jump in, okay, keep this open and see, see, we can jump back into the balance sheet and take a look at the balance sheet. To it needs like,

Unknown Speaker  06:02
I'm not sure that's gonna take it much,

Matthias Miller  06:04
hit Ctrl Ctrl, click the back button, and I'll open a new tab or right click the back button, and the left arrow and the top left Oh, either control click or right click and open a new tab. There you go. If you go over to your

Unknown Speaker  06:30
Yeah, it's just gonna take a while to load this thing again. Oh, got it.

Matthias Miller  06:42
By the way, if speed is an issue, we do have a feature that lets us cache certain types of totals in the database. I don't know if it's something we want to take a look at. But

Unknown Speaker  06:54
it becomes a problem we could explore that only.

Speaker 1  07:00
I mean, this is our being on video. And what often is, like huge level, I mean, these don't load very fast, but they do faster, when I'm not on the video. Got it. But the Transaction Search is something that'd be really nice to have some more speed, but I don't know if there's a way to do that. I

Matthias Miller  07:25
think it's on our list to look at and talk about.

Speaker 1  07:28
I mean, like, you know, you go search vendor invoices, basically instantaneous. Now, there's one transaction for $1,342. And you got to sit here and wait for 30 seconds. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  07:46
Understand? Okay, so what's the category that we're wanting to add on here? Let's start with that. Well,

Speaker 1  07:59
I mean, we have our we have our current asset totals there. And we have the fixed assets like that's, that was one of the things that I had in mind. Do you have other things?

Matthias Miller  08:12
I'm a little puzzled

Speaker 2  08:13
what okay, what what was it that we were trying to still fix or change on the balance sheet?

Matthias Miller  08:23
Let me see. Find my records of that.

Unknown Speaker  08:26
We split current and long term.

Unknown Speaker  08:30
Like Wasn't there something with assets? Current fixed assets or do we? Well,

Speaker 1  08:38
that was my recollection is that we wanted those different sub types which would be like current and fixed to show totals. And thus those would show totals current liabilities long term liabilities, other liabilities not sure if that should be in other liabilities or not other liabilities

Unknown Speaker  09:06
probably just because there is nothing I mean if if

Unknown Speaker  09:08
he'd been in long term

Unknown Speaker  09:11
or because I set something up around

Speaker 2  09:13
there's yeah there's something that we would expect to have other liabilities be its own sake. Like three liability sanctions,

Speaker 1  09:26
probably but these should be there.

Unknown Speaker  09:32
I wonder if these accounts

Unknown Speaker  09:36
I'm

Unknown Speaker  09:45
reading currently

Speaker 1  09:57
I have two different kinds of long term there's To word long term and one word long term

Unknown Speaker  10:04
there is

Matthias Miller  10:07
a yeah you're right

Unknown Speaker  10:13
does that have it

Matthias Miller  10:16
that would probably be the issue if you want if if we would

Unknown Speaker  10:22
current liabilities long term liabilities

Unknown Speaker  10:30
are liabilities subtypes long term

Unknown Speaker  10:40
financing debt balance sheet category

Unknown Speaker  11:04
so which ruins

Unknown Speaker  11:11
your mind

Unknown Speaker  11:30
looks like it shouldn't be a section

Matthias Miller  11:35
but it's a custom subtype so I think if you would understand

Speaker 3  11:47
we check one other thing first before I tell you something that's wildly inaccurate

Unknown Speaker  11:59
Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  12:00
what do you

Matthias Miller  12:02
think of the subtype if you I mean, is there a reason to have two subtypes?

Speaker 1  12:10
No, I mean I'm assuming Well, there had been an issue with wanting them capitalized. I forget what it

Speaker 2  12:21
was I think it came preloaded with with some and we had we wanted to have the first like our subtypes all capitalized so we had the balance sheet and income statement the first three or four levels are all caps and I'm wondering if that long term liabilities to the other one it's not all caps was a pretty loaded one. We have to have a custom one created

Matthias Miller  12:47
Can you change Steve to the not all caps subtype and rerun the balance sheet and see what it does

Unknown Speaker  12:56
you're saying this thing

Unknown Speaker  12:59
Yeah, the jet yeah that one

Unknown Speaker  13:02
because this one yep

Unknown Speaker  13:07
correct

Matthias Miller  13:15
and then let's see what happens when we rerun the balance sheet

Unknown Speaker  13:31
that you just refresh it?

Matthias Miller  14:28
So I suspect if we do this because it's a built in one it should recognize that it is actually a long term liability. Now it's still under other liabilities.

Unknown Speaker  14:43
Now I've moved. It's down here now.

Matthias Miller  14:47
Yeah, but now you've got but it's still under the other three but it's not under the That's under the long term like like that doesn't make sense

Unknown Speaker  15:06
let me that's That is weird

Unknown Speaker  15:18
Let me see how they come up with that

Unknown Speaker  15:28
it's

Matthias Miller  15:33
subtypes current liabilities, balance sheet rolls, long term liability and all right I think I have it

Matthias Miller  15:58
she category Okay, here's what you need to do now go over into your account subtypes and go into each of your long term your long term liabilities open up all your long term liabilities including your other long term liability if you want to use it, you can disregard that I'm actually editing and hit Edit balance sheet category got it under liabilities Yep. And then you want to you can change J Back to the all caps so you can save this change any of the others change J Back to without a space or the other one for consistency.

Speaker 2  16:49
What is the source index on that? Zero to 10,000 Is that

Unknown Speaker  16:56
was put in a certain order

Matthias Miller  16:58
Yeah, controls the order on the income statement and balance sheet

Unknown Speaker  17:14
All right.

Matthias Miller  17:16
And then theoretically that should fix this

Matthias Miller  17:30
and then you also have an option to override it on a per account basis. So let's say you have a long term liability account and you want to say I know treat this as a current liability that hurts the long term liability category I don't know why you'd want to do that but you can

Speaker 2  18:02
we're multitasking with lads we're getting a check fixed up to pay a vendor Nice.

Unknown Speaker  18:12
So this was

Speaker 2  18:15
a cash back error or whatever it calls it. You know, problem exists between keyboard and chair

Unknown Speaker  18:32
so they caught this one they were.

Unknown Speaker  18:58
So we're done here though. Right.

Matthias Miller  19:00
So does that mean scroll down? Take a look. Yeah. And so anything else you need to fix up in the wrong section? I mean, that looks right everywhere anyway, but if there's anything you need to fix up, that's how you do it.

Unknown Speaker  19:15
Great, great.

Matthias Miller  19:19
Um, that's balance sheet payment ID, Josh's court

Matthias Miller  19:29
reconcile exports whenever you're ready to take a look back.

Speaker 1  19:33
Did Oh, I sent an email with what I'm finding? Yes.

Matthias Miller  19:36
Like take a look at that.

Speaker 1  19:39
So it's a printout of one of the exports all I have is half the sheet.

Unknown Speaker  19:50
So the words

Matthias Miller  19:55
it's not good enough. Well,

Speaker 1  19:59
I'm sure to have a little More information. I can't do anything with zooming or there's no. Like it exports as a while it says word merge, but it's basically a Word document. Like if it would export as an Excel file, or, I mean, that would be handy for some purposes, but even just simply Export as pdf would be, like

Matthias Miller  20:31
keeping, how do I get to it?

Speaker 1  20:33
Um, reconcile any of the reconciles? Well, I don't know how you get to that particular

Matthias Miller  20:42
export, I say no, yeah, up in the top right corner.

Speaker 1  20:51
Now, this is only the first pay like five pages long like that everything's listed. It just doesn't have the right side of the page.

Unknown Speaker  21:02
Well, we can't

Unknown Speaker  21:09
it should be

Matthias Miller  21:13
one landscape, not

Unknown Speaker  21:16
portrait, first of all?

Matthias Miller  21:21
I mean, that would do the trick.

Matthias Miller  21:29
All right, let's do this. Core accounting. This is not a we've got some time to get this nailed down. Is that right?

Unknown Speaker  21:42
Yeah, about what to

Unknown Speaker  21:47
do. Alright.

Speaker 1  21:51
Yeah, it will, it's fine. I'm gonna keep on, I'm gonna still be reconciling. So it's not going to stop me from reconciling, just not having a thing to print out.

Matthias Miller  22:03
But you're, you're wanting one of these two, you're wanting one of these to run for.

Unknown Speaker  22:10
For this reconcile, period, right.

Speaker 1  22:11
Yeah, that would be nice. That's what I was hoping. Like, and it's just what I want it for is just so that I have a report of, okay, when I reconciled, this is what went into the reconcile, like these transactions reconcile these ones were unreconciled. Right.

Speaker 4  22:35
You got the date, direct action. So let's go through

Unknown Speaker  22:48
conciliation report word merge.

Speaker 1  23:01
In there, theoretically, nothing will change. So I mean, that's the right to probably roll out. You know, you would think that I could go back, if we get the printouts down in two weeks, I could go back and just print them out again. You know, create them without violence without working.

Speaker 2  23:23
So what are you what would you do with those actually print hard copies and save them? Save

Speaker 4  23:28
videos? We say? Just

Speaker 1  23:34
it's basically it's a verification. I mean, you could you know, if somebody wanted to know, hey, these checks, what hit the bank? Here's your here's your report. What hit the bank? If somebody will see it,

Speaker 2  23:48
and is there a place in assists for these are safer, about a violent,

Unknown Speaker  23:52
I would just file them separately

Unknown Speaker  24:03
it's mostly just to

Speaker 1  24:06
safeguard things like, like you're playing with QuickBooks, you know, stuff changes. So if somebody somebody deletes a check or the system or does something, you know, there's the back button is okay, yeah, we did have that check.

Unknown Speaker  24:25
All right, well, it just helps us be able to see stuff.

Matthias Miller  24:32
Okay, good news and bad news.

Unknown Speaker  24:35
Good news is

Unknown Speaker  24:41
if you

Matthias Miller  24:43
Output it as PDF,

Unknown Speaker  24:46
then

Matthias Miller  24:49
it will we'll see all the information. The bad news is it still looks ugly in my opinion. But let me know

Speaker 1  24:59
Well, how do you do as PDF? Isn't ever again?

Matthias Miller  25:04
No, it doesn't. We need to. We just want to change the report correctly to generate, change the button generate PDF. So I can chase that

Matthias Miller  25:26
yeah, and then we'll figure out how to at least give you something and then you're good.

Speaker 2  25:35
But do you still want to see how to do PDF now for immediate?

Matthias Miller  25:41
Well, I can I can push this change live later this afternoon. Well, I think later this afternoon, or tomorrow for you to be able to do that.

Speaker 1  25:52
Yeah, that should be fine. I don't dwell on my butt. No, I think

Matthias Miller  26:09
you should be able to go back into the reconcile and still generate the export.

Speaker 1  26:14
Right? Right. That's all I'm saying. If it's not, you know, if it's not right now, that's okay. Because I can go back and get an

Matthias Miller  26:26
ACH duel.

Speaker 1  26:29
So this is from paying two invoices at once for a vendor, I sent an email Josh, you I might have copied you in on it. I haven't gotten any reply. I just didn't know where this is. At. There's one one that needs fixed up because of it. But it didn't fill in information on one of the two invoices that were paid together.

Matthias Miller  26:56
If it's Ach, I would probably say bring it up in your Wednesday call with him again, yeah. Do you need it before then?

Unknown Speaker  27:10
Know that yeah, or

Unknown Speaker  27:19
all right.

Matthias Miller  27:21
self inflicted duplicates.

Speaker 1  27:23
So in the reconcile, actually, I might even

Speaker 1  27:33
Well, yeah, probably. Um, but anyway, so it's saying that checks are duplicates of invoices. So it says, Here's the same vendor, same number, same amount, same date, same payment account and it's not matching like we don't have different or same invoice numbers so it must be a duplicate

Matthias Miller  28:05
Can you show me an example just

Speaker 1  28:09
so I have well I sent a screenshot of one of the things but I can do a

Matthias Miller  28:22
they're self inflicted duplicate appears to duplicate one or more invoices so 24324533 It's action view DT view

Speaker 3  28:35
see what did I say two four or 53324533

Unknown Speaker  28:45
inside

Matthias Miller  28:47
so we have here

Matthias Miller  28:54
here's the duplicate mid code 98787 which is a check for 9787

Unknown Speaker  29:07
duplicate and waste warning

Unknown Speaker  29:12
exclude

Unknown Speaker  29:25
right

Matthias Miller  29:33
refining the vendor invoice

Matthias Miller  29:40
so we should

Speaker 1  29:46
I mean, is there a way to say no, these two are actually tied together. Now?

Matthias Miller  29:55
Yes, I think so. So if we've got three numbers here transaction and vendor invoice ID This is on the transaction

Unknown Speaker  30:12
trans assist

Speaker 3  30:16
no accounting transaction duplicate brands duplicate invoice warning

Unknown Speaker  30:59
okay um

Matthias Miller  31:02
let me chase that I know what needs to happen but we've got

Unknown Speaker  31:16
basically

Matthias Miller  31:23
yeah I mean this the same transaction can exist as a check as a vendor invoice and as an as an accounting transaction so when we filter out duplicates we need to filter out all of those at any given time so I will chase that

Unknown Speaker  31:42
make sense

Matthias Miller  31:48
all right, and then

Speaker 4  32:01
see less my list now

Unknown Speaker  32:06
we have

Unknown Speaker  32:09
I'm gonna share my screen for this.

Matthias Miller  32:11
Oh, and I'm going to checks and reconcile. Isn't that just as simple as saying those should get pushed her County?

Speaker 1  32:20
No, I don't think so. Because these are dated six. All right. So and I sent you a printout but so right here I have these jacks isn't reconcile module. These checks here, which they look weird because normally, this is probably all just one check. Just separate invoices to one check. I don't know. But if I go to here, this is the check record. And we don't have any unprinted checks listed. All of these that were printed on the six do not they're not including those ones that are on this reconciles on printed.

Matthias Miller  33:06
Can you drill into one of those credit check transactions?

Speaker 1  33:09
Yeah. So if I do that, it you know, it says unprinted resource record I got this one printed

Matthias Miller  33:21
it's coming out to vendor invoice do we know for sure Okay, scroll up. So this is 18 542

Unknown Speaker  33:36
inside browse knew

Matthias Miller  33:54
somebody deleted the link check

Matthias Miller  34:05
okay, for some something it got unlinked from it somehow. So we could do a let me see if I can do activity history and find out where it went. Activity search so this would be an assist check where the modified field would be assist check be i num ID and the new value.

Unknown Speaker  34:33
Any activity

Matthias Miller  34:40
Wait, here's saying it was never tied to that. Let's try the old value just for fun. Why would it be saying okay so

Speaker 3  34:55
the tail view vendor invoice I pull up the same one One

Matthias Miller  35:02
modification history

Matthias Miller  35:11
so here it says on the sixth you tried to create

Unknown Speaker  35:18
okay let's try this then let's go to activity history

Matthias Miller  35:26
or checks on to six by Drew and from

Unknown Speaker  35:38
now to six to two six at 1:20pm

Unknown Speaker  35:58
Well

Matthias Miller  36:02
okay that's

Unknown Speaker  36:06
lugz

Unknown Speaker  36:09
modification CV modifications

Unknown Speaker  36:24
Come on do it okay oh

Unknown Speaker  36:36
to

Speaker 3  36:44
18 to 15 to 13 2876 At 1320

Speaker 3  37:13
we find 513 20 Right in here somewhere 1320 by Drew

Matthias Miller  37:27
so you've saved the vendor invoice that 13

Unknown Speaker  37:42
Running vendor invoices needing payment paid by cheque

Speaker 3  38:17
King six okay that was a different one that you modified so you ran a pay by cheque

Unknown Speaker  38:33
a blank check

Matthias Miller  38:36
and your invoices dot x 30 Why is it only running? Wait a minute

Unknown Speaker  38:45
Wow

Unknown Speaker  38:52
Euston we have a problem

Matthias Miller  39:17
somehow you managed to run only half of the process which stumped the unprinted check on here, but didn't actually create the corresponding check.

Speaker 1  39:27
So I think I'm recollecting a little bit now. There was a time I don't even recall what it was but it might have been ABC News probably about then. There's the Fitz proximately. I started Why is it selected to print a couple are mean to pay by cheque. And then I saw that oh, one of them is not what I wanted. And so I cancelled it the Cancel button and then It ended up with my right screen had all those new checks and the left screen still had everything to page like they were in both places.

Unknown Speaker  40:17
So

Speaker 1  40:18
what I did was I removed them from the checks and then I deleted the checks I think was that sound right? And then I reprinted them again, but I don't see why I wouldn't have actually if that is the case they should these vendors should show up in those checks for the six then

Matthias Miller  40:53
Well, if you would have problem is I don't see any. Okay, let me let me see the problem is I don't see any activity with checks on the six prior to that you would not have Okay, hang on. Let me let me let me run this search here and see if there was any way that you could have gotten to this

Unknown Speaker  41:30
some other way

Unknown Speaker  41:35
it's taking a little bit but it's about three quarters done

Matthias Miller  42:02
this case though, you were modifying? I guess that's one thing you could check we could check on modifications to

Unknown Speaker  42:09
vendor invoices over that time.

Matthias Miller  42:13
And so at 120 There were a whole bunch of vendor invoices that you modified

Speaker 3  42:24
about see what the count is 19 of them in facts in this batch. Well, it's a search run

Matthias Miller  42:52
you wouldn't have gotten browsing for like browsing in the standard folder to run the pay by cheque. I don't even see why you could have gotten to that but

Speaker 1  43:09
I mean not me personally now.

Speaker 1  43:17
I mean, the other the other the guys that are printing the check I mean all they're gonna do is print you know what's on printed or if they have a king you know reprint something but

Matthias Miller  43:29
yeah, that's gonna be on that's gonna be on there under their user account not yours.

Unknown Speaker  43:35
Well, no, it is they're using my user account.

Unknown Speaker  43:39
Oh

Unknown Speaker  43:42
yeah, cuz they're all logged in as me.

Matthias Miller  43:45
Can we change that?

Unknown Speaker  43:46
Maybe we shouldn't get them another one.

Matthias Miller  43:50
I would like that whenever I would like to know it's nice notice you're not stereos

Unknown Speaker  43:57
Yeah.

Speaker 3  44:02
Me I know this is going to be able to find anything or not but let's try this

Unknown Speaker  44:09
no

Unknown Speaker  44:21
All right. All right

Matthias Miller  44:36
now unless there is some kind of

Speaker 3  44:56
let's do this 20 tween 402 to 20 2402

Matthias Miller  45:08
with the username drew Yoder database level would be

Unknown Speaker  45:18
let's just do this

Speaker 3  45:52
income statement to UBI account event again like human accounts

Unknown Speaker  46:07
we don't have more detail about which day you actually

Matthias Miller  46:18
okay my my request would be a let's give them different user accounts there's something if they are doing something you shouldn't have you can see that second of all Can we just check with them to make sure they didn't do something funny when they were trying to

Unknown Speaker  46:37
pay these yeah

Matthias Miller  46:41
I can maybe also

Speaker 1  46:46
like these here like there would be one like fibers and gravel here would just be one check right? I mean, is that correct like this is that this is coming from

Matthias Miller  47:04
what's it's getting from the vendor invoice

Unknown Speaker  47:07
yeah

Unknown Speaker  47:10
okay

Speaker 1  47:13
so there's this one I was number one to kind of number one the fact that sand and gravel

Matthias Miller  47:25
and yeah, it looks like and it looks like there was a whole batch of these that that were done like this

Matthias Miller  47:38
I will do I can do one other search just to make sure there's no report within no custom user report that would have let them do this well, they would have had to have a custom use report to do this there is no other is there

Matthias Miller  48:19
you run input for select values

Unknown Speaker  48:28
okay,

Matthias Miller  48:28
I want to

Matthias Miller  48:39
they they almost certainly wouldn't have done it manually though. That's the thing right

Unknown Speaker  48:50
all right. Let me see if

Matthias Miller  48:53
we take just another few minutes here

Unknown Speaker  49:12
let me too and Sydney PBE.

Unknown Speaker  50:51
Wait a minute

Matthias Miller  50:51
no it is broken up like that

Unknown Speaker  50:55
so so

Unknown Speaker  51:03
go to slash oh six slash

Matthias Miller  51:39
So the other option would be if possibly.

Speaker 1  52:25
mean I'm kind of guessing that they actually went to print and they're probably printed but for some reason we don't have the number brought back in because I mean maybe these are all just gracious vendors I wouldn't have said anything if they didn't receive payment we definitely have some others that are not so gracious but it doesn't

Matthias Miller  53:05
The weird thing is there's no record of us even attempting to create the checks like nothing. So I guess the no this is a DB modification. So So remove

Unknown Speaker  53:25
we match

Matthias Miller  53:31
match rows we

Unknown Speaker  53:32
delete

Matthias Miller  53:46
No, we want a

Unknown Speaker  53:50
pay by cheque checks

Unknown Speaker  53:56
so if

Matthias Miller  54:00
match records we update on match

Matthias Miller  54:20
is there any chance?

Unknown Speaker  54:56
But big

Matthias Miller  55:02
Is there any chance these checks would have somehow gotten?

Matthias Miller  55:13
Good. Do we have a question?

Unknown Speaker  55:18
Check search.

Matthias Miller  55:21
And we look for let's pick homes because that's

Unknown Speaker  55:25
this is an

Unknown Speaker  55:29
ABC homes longer

Unknown Speaker  55:44
we have a check on the 13th.

Unknown Speaker  55:48
two to six.

Matthias Miller  55:54
Okay, would any of them have had? A? Alright, we're just gonna go back into activity history and see if there's anything. Okay, this one had. Okay, that was created on the 28th. So that one's excluded. Created on the 20th. That one's excluded. Created on the 13th, that one's excluded. That one would have gotten a check number,

Unknown Speaker  56:21
excuse me.

Matthias Miller  56:24
So that one,

Speaker 3  56:27
he might check X. And printed checks, checks by counting the payee is if you don't have a check number.

Matthias Miller  56:42
So in this case, we assigned the check number on the 31st.

Unknown Speaker  56:47
Well, let me make sure

Matthias Miller  56:50
90% Sure. Yes, give it a check number the first that one's not relevant. This one we assigned, check number the 24th that's not relevant

Unknown Speaker  57:04
this one

Unknown Speaker  57:14
on the sixth at

Matthias Miller  57:18
1103, you gave a check number

Speaker 3  57:24
let's go to this 112. Okay, so

Unknown Speaker  57:34
this is the suspicious one.

Unknown Speaker  57:50
Over the mounts

Speaker 1  57:58
is a combination of about seven inches should be in the neighborhood of six $7,000 Somewhere in there

Matthias Miller  58:16
so it looks like earlier in the day. Well, that's January 6, it's not relevant either. Like I can't find I can't find any explanation for it

Matthias Miller  58:51
there were no checks modified prior. I mean, around this time.

Speaker 1  58:59
6263 76 sounds dumb as it should be. But well, that's weird.

Matthias Miller  59:07
I want to chase that more. I probably shouldn't take the time now. I'm, I'm sorry. I'm a little less. I still think we should give them different logins. Um, yeah, less confident that they're actually to blame. But I also don't know what to blame.

Speaker 1  59:27
Right. What information that you need in order to create a login for them?

Matthias Miller  59:38
I'm probably struggling with Dwayne, I think the well or we could do it now. We need a Google account to log in. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  59:53
Gmail, Gmail or

Speaker 4  59:58
Yeah, Yeah. Okay.

Speaker 1  1:00:03
And it would have to be a distinct Google account from the one that I'm using.

Matthias Miller  1:00:07
Oh, yes. Because you're using Yeah, I'm using a company one. You're using a company one you can create Google accounts with

Unknown Speaker  1:00:21
without G Netta.

Matthias Miller  1:00:27
Let's see if we can find out how.

Speaker 1  1:00:30
Because these I think, I think or yeah, they're like Microsoft managed

Unknown Speaker  1:00:42
clouds.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:44
Somebody set them up

Matthias Miller  1:00:49
okay, it would be actually this over to you

Unknown Speaker  1:00:57
setting up Google account

Unknown Speaker  1:01:00
See

Unknown Speaker  1:01:07
you can use your non Gmail

Unknown Speaker  1:01:24
Okay,

Matthias Miller  1:01:24
so you set up an account with that you can use a non Gmail address to set up the account

Unknown Speaker  1:01:31
and then go from there. Okay.

Matthias Miller  1:01:44
Well, that was interesting.

Matthias Miller  1:01:55
checks through checks need to go through the epic cycle to effect the counting. Yes.

Speaker 3  1:01:59
If you go to scheduled tasks, I can show you how to kick that off whenever you're ready to.

Unknown Speaker  1:02:08
Okay.

Matthias Miller  1:02:10
If you just want to open it up, yeah, it's under administration. Or admin. Yep. Then hit OK. Continue.

Speaker 4  1:02:26
Okay, and Oh, yeah. Okay. And

Matthias Miller  1:02:31
then post. So the top one there selected post AP slash check transactions. And then what you'll do is you'll hit the schedule immediate run in the top right. Got it? And then just refresh periodically, and you should see, it'll say, you know, scheduled for or like it's, it shows something that indicates that it's getting ready to run soon. And if you keep refreshing you should be able to see it then get done.

Unknown Speaker  1:02:59
Yeah. Okay.

Speaker 1  1:03:15
The barrel transaction imports, just the status update on that. Was that something that came through already

Matthias Miller  1:03:23
or not? Yes, that is in

Unknown Speaker  1:03:28
Wait, let me just make sure.

Speaker 4  1:03:54
Like to get to the vendor, right, left blank. Yeah. If similar things are the disease now two minutes or so

Matthias Miller  1:04:08
that import is in Jonathan's court to take a look at whenever he Okay. Switch is able to work on this stuff in the next week or two. Okay.

Speaker 1  1:04:27
All right. I'm giving you live on 12. There's one other thing that we forgot to put on here that we should probably get to and that is the issue of vendor credits, while just vendor credits and customer credits. Now I think we've talked about it before but we haven't really made it's been a thing that we need to address some time and we recently discovered that it's the thing we need to address sooner rather than later. The right Isn't is what they've been doing with when receiving a vendor credit is creating an invoice. And they've been, they've been putting accounts payable in the accounts payable RG box. So we had the same issue as the bank account and in the deposit statements that doesn't work. But the other problem is, so there's a credit comes back on a specific invoice which ties to, you know, a specific Purchase Order, which creates a price for that item. And then, you know, if we send the half them back and get a separate credit back, it never updates the pricing on those items. So, I'm wondering, and we don't we have a workaround. But we don't want to try to train AP and on how to do the workaround, because it's fairly complicated. But would there be a way to create a separate thing like an invoice vendor invoice that's basically just a vendor credit, but it looks similar to vendor invoice. And then they could if it's tied to a particular purchase order, or you know, invoice or whatever, if it's tied to something or credit for that particular one, they could just find that purchase order, just like they would when they're when they're connecting regular invoices. And then it would just create a line item on that purchase order which would then adjust the pricing and everything and it would become you know, a negative or our credit to be used when paying that vendor then so when it would look like an invoice but it would really just make adjustments to the purchase order. And then if there is no purchase of it's not tied to anything in particular, it's just a, we like you here's a credit then we would just they would just have to put like in the miscellaneous line box just put in whatever expense account that it normally would be. So if it's if it's Apple outdoors, then you know normally that would be raw materials and they just have to select raw materials there and we'd have to at least train them that far. But and then we would do the exact same thing for customer credits where we could select a sales order to apply the credit to but

Speaker 2  1:07:51
I don't know if it's that simple. Would it be helpful for Matthias to see some of those that we did those lows ones that we did the long way around

Matthias Miller  1:08:02
my first question before we get to that is Have you guys talked to Josh about this at all?

Speaker 2  1:08:09
We did Wednesday morning asked him whether this should be with because he made some comment about being able to tie multiple vendor invoices.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:21
Multiple invoice purchase order which I thought you can't do. And then I asked him about this and he said

Speaker 2  1:08:29
I said Who should we talk to and he said start the conversation with Matthias and pull me and if you need me

Matthias Miller  1:08:54
so it would be a vendor invoice that has an A negative received quantity

Unknown Speaker  1:09:04
per skews

Speaker 2  1:09:08
Yeah, I mean I think that's what we'd asked you about a purchase order to do a negative for that exact thing but wow.

Speaker 1  1:09:26
Like it goes on the purchase order. Well for our work around what we did was we created landed free purchase orders.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:38
Right so

Speaker 1  1:09:41
we created a negative land and freight purchase orders and tie those in so that it adjusts the amount. Right.

Matthias Miller  1:09:53
But that still doesn't mean that won't correct your inventory levels.

Speaker 1  1:09:58
Yeah, that then And sometimes there's no inventory change. You know, for some other reason we

Matthias Miller  1:10:07
returned cheaper or something or other who knows or like you said, we like you discounts that

Speaker 2  1:10:13
the workaround we did Matthias did though the inventory quantities were right. And the pricing was correct on the workaround we did we had it was a prepaid where Lowe's, they charge sales tax and then we said no, no, no don't charge sales tax. So they

Unknown Speaker  1:10:33
they applied a credit in the amount of the sales tax. So Josh built this thing where you can buy a load of lumber and then you can

Speaker 2  1:10:48
have, if you don't have them deliver, you have another vendor, you have a freight person pick that up. And then so you now you have two Invoices to Pay, but you you want to lump those two together on the purchase on the SKU level. So your two by fours reflect the landed cost. So what we did was use that same principle except what's normally the frayed purchase order an invoice with just a negative value which gave us the two invoices the two transactions that match know like the credit card charge and credit. And then it also made so this the to the price on the two by fours or the SKU was was correct. Sure.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:47
That makes sense.

Matthias Miller  1:11:52
When it wouldn't work for is a Okay, can you can you do something? Okay, like here is a let's go for the heather shingles. See what okay, there's a skew this one does not already have. So the basic issue is that we're not going to show

Matthias Miller  1:12:21
when we're not going to show skews that have already been invoiced here right is that the basic problem?

Unknown Speaker  1:12:31
Yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:12:34
Like if we go to vendor invoices and we're gonna go just find one that let's just go find a paid one

Matthias Miller  1:12:51
so here's one for airworks and so if we want to ideally what we would so So ultimately what you want to do is you want to flip the vendor invoice view to show items that are

Unknown Speaker  1:13:19
that are already connected that are already

Matthias Miller  1:13:21
connected. Now one

Speaker 1  1:13:24
complication to this if we're going to make it user friendly is usually when when they send a vendor when they send a credit memo back to us they will say this is on the items originally on thus and thus invoice and they never mentioned the purchase order got it? If we if we can connect to original vendor I don't know how but if we have some way to use the vendor invoice number to link us that would save a whole step of looking up that original one saying okay which ones was it

Unknown Speaker  1:14:07
doing well

Matthias Miller  1:14:10
is there ever that you would have a credit for multiple invoices

Unknown Speaker  1:14:16
um that could

Speaker 1  1:14:21
be possible like if they charge sales tax on three and you say hey, you know like we've told you 16 times sales tax in the case of Sherwin Williams and the right well they probably would refund you something wrong but you know, they might do it all at once.

Matthias Miller  1:14:43
Is there any problem with just having

Matthias Miller  1:14:50
having a AP enter the credit three times in that case?

Unknown Speaker  1:14:58
Probably not. I'm gonna it's gonna be Be scarabs

Speaker 2  1:15:02
Oh, just but not all, not all credits are going to be tied to a specific vendor invoice like I guess those I would be inclined on saying that those rather than creating a negative invoice like we are now those ideally should just live on the vendor record somehow like you. I mean,

Speaker 1  1:15:29
yeah, that would be nice if they could, I mean, they could be created as that. That negative, you know, it'd be a credit memo or whatever, but

Speaker 2  1:15:41
so when you create a credit, you either then tie it off to a specific pre existing invoice. Or if you don't tie it off, it just sits on the vendor rack is that?

Speaker 1  1:15:56
Well, they both would. So if it's a specific on one hand it it gets expensed to that specific breaded, and then it sits here waiting on the vendor record to be used. If it doesn't go to a specific credit, or specific invoice, then it has to go just in general, to lower that expense amount in some account. But it still sits on the menu, right?

Speaker 2  1:16:26
But it wouldn't lower the expense account until you use it until you applied right?

Speaker 1  1:16:36
The way the way QuickBooks will deal with it is it would lower AP by the animal. So if you get a vendor credit back from vendor that you don't owe anything to, you know, I'll say, you over you sent them a duplicate check. And, you know, so it just makes AP go $2,000.

Unknown Speaker  1:16:57
And then yeah, that's really all it does. So

Matthias Miller  1:17:11
next question, is it so you're looking to have a running credit balance? And not having? I mean, can we continue to have these be credit metrics? Can we basically have these work like negative vendor invoices. And you still whenever you want to use a credit, you still select it and pay by invoice and it shows up? You know, just gets lumped in and applied at that point.

Speaker 1  1:17:42
I think that would I think that's a fine way to utilize them. I mean, I don't know that we have to reinvent the system to try and do differently. I mean, that works that way. We just want to be making sure that if we like, we should have a way to be able to look up a vendor and say, Okay, we paid you these amounts in the last whatever date range. And here's the credits we got from you. And here's the standing battles, and like we shouldn't be able to have a way to do that.

Matthias Miller  1:18:19
That's as simple as a

Unknown Speaker  1:18:21
as a report problem. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:18:23
I've been rebalanced report or something.

Speaker 2  1:18:27
And ideally, that would show up whenever you go to pay say Sherwin Williams, it says, Hey, you have $500 for the credits, do you wish to take them?

Speaker 1  1:18:36
Well, if we use the system, if we keep, like what it is, it would just it would just live there. Now, is there a way to make so that they don't continually show up? He's like, if they're in that if, if it is the way it is now I think anyway, that credit will continually show up for on the VR. And then we'll probably continue to bother AP on something somewhere. Because it looks like I mean, they've they've gotten me a couple of times on wondering when credits are going to be paid. Big because they haven't gotten used up they either didn't have the ability or something like no, it's a credit Yeah, on

Speaker 2  1:19:20
that side on the reporting side. We want them to not show right I don't nobody really they just show up there by default right now but

Speaker 1  1:19:31
it'd be nice if your credit could like show on the on the vendor verification just to basically let them know hey, you know, there's Oh yeah, we did send all that paint back or

Unknown Speaker  1:19:43
we whatever,

Unknown Speaker  1:19:46
like the first time

Speaker 2  1:19:49
if you like it has doesn't have enough value out there at all. And

Unknown Speaker  1:19:52
then let's cut it

Speaker 2  1:19:57
because like, as far as them approving it To be used, I mean, like everybody wants to use credit. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:04
Okay

Unknown Speaker  1:20:13
maybe they should have a different status or something.

Speaker 2  1:20:17
Oh, just to make if we do a different status they show up on a different

Speaker 1  1:20:20
board, then yeah, they could they could still show up here. But they would not. They would not be unpaid approved.

Matthias Miller  1:20:31
I mean, we could be I mean, there's no approval process for credits is there

Unknown Speaker  1:20:37
no.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:41
Automatic Yes.

Matthias Miller  1:20:45
We're gonna turn it down when

Speaker 2  1:20:49
that's the point like, yeah, it's kind of silly to have a district manager say Oh, today I want to use this credit towards this like

Matthias Miller  1:20:57
Right. I mean, we could theoretically have a rate Reddit status and that is the only status you can have right

Speaker 1  1:21:18
and then we need to vendor invoices meaning payment would have to pick up credit and on paper right.

Speaker 2  1:21:50
So, without asking you thinking, like what are you thinking as far as next steps on this? sighs? Well, there's a Josh Are you think?

Matthias Miller  1:21:59
I think I can knock out the vendor invoice. There's one other piece that I thought we needed to talk about what was it?

Speaker 2  1:22:07
Oh, we had that. Transactions by contact report. But subtype report that.

Matthias Miller  1:22:18
So as long as as long as we're able to, as long as you're able to, as long as we can have vendor invoices that tie up the skews have negative amounts. Okay, bottom line, as long as as, as the concept works of having the skews, tie out to the PIO with negative amounts. And, you know, having negative non Pio expense line items, and using basically using vendor invoices under the hood free credit memos, but so that process stays the same, excluding them as appropriate from AP so that they don't get bogged down with them. And probably some other little niggling details here and there to iron out. But seems to me like it's pretty straightforward.

Unknown Speaker  1:23:18
I mean, it's,

Matthias Miller  1:23:20
it's closer to it. Well, I mean, it's it's a Yeah. I mean, I haven't been blacking out as much time lately for this stuff as before. So it might be better part of a of a week of my calendar time, but

Unknown Speaker  1:23:47
I don't think it's completely out of

Speaker 1  1:23:54
it. Is it reasonable to think that we can just apply the same theory to customers and sales orders?

Unknown Speaker  1:24:09
No.

Matthias Miller  1:24:13
Well, when he, when do you issue credits, sales? Well, sales orders was the other piece I wanted to talk about. Yeah, I'm afraid that sales orders is going to be a longer conversation. And I think I think we have to table that I need to know. Yeah. More about what we're looking to get done there before I commit to anything on that.

Speaker 2  1:24:41
As far as priorities on this, is this is this top priority right now.

Unknown Speaker  1:24:49
For Matthias?

Speaker 1  1:24:52
I would say pretty close. I mean, because we got we actually have a whole bunch hanging out. We need to talk about what we want to do. With all in the past, but

Matthias Miller  1:25:09
company and vendor mismatch

Unknown Speaker  1:25:17
I would put it before that

Matthias Miller  1:25:22
reconciliation still comes first a reconciliation summary, which is a small change.

Unknown Speaker  1:25:28
Yeah, that's come first. Okay.

Matthias Miller  1:25:34
Let me shoot a message over to Audra.

Unknown Speaker  1:25:41
Solutions summary changes, no click

Speaker 2  1:25:45
or this or this credits thing I think it would be helpful Matthias if you would put together a bit of a design proposal on how you expect us to work shoot it over and we can add our thoughts to it

Matthias Miller  1:26:06
Yeah, let's do that. I'm gonna have to drop here. I'll I'll work on making that a priority you guys and then I guess let me know if let me know how much time you guys want to devote tomorrow to this stuff. I would be I could start soon after, to your time if you guys want more time to work through any of this stuff where we can just wait until next Thursday. So I'll leave that near quarters where it's what you guys want. Sounds good. That sounds good. Okay, awesome. Thanks.
