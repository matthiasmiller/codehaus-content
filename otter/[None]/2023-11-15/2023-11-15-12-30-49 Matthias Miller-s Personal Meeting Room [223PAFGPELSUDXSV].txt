Unknown Speaker  00:56
All right

Speaker 1  01:49
It Matthias is on these agendas if there are new tasks your your standard operating procedure now is you're just doing a change request right and I see it in the report

Unknown Speaker  02:32
yeah okay just double check

Speaker 1  02:38
I don't know if there are I don't know if this rename rollforming LLC as a new task or

Matthias Miller  02:49
some of these depends on a case by case basis and it's something that we could knock out on the call and

Speaker 1  02:57
I figure it's easier for you to do that do a change request and for me to figure it out so just double

Matthias Miller  03:02
checking that's what we're doing

Unknown Speaker  03:14
here in your small office again, right?

Matthias Miller  03:17
Yeah, another Yeah, give me another couple of weeks and hopefully he'll be in my other space

Speaker 2  03:26
you don't have enough room to wander around and down all right.

Speaker 3  03:36
So Matthias I'm confused what am I supposed to talk to God about?

Matthias Miller  03:40
Well, why did God sit and stick to that number?

Speaker 3  03:45
How would she have set the standard she's she's a wholesale dealer who creates a building through the configurator

Matthias Miller  03:50
so the configurator created that

Speaker 3  03:53
yes, sorry. That would have been more sense to say it that way. I'm

Speaker 3  04:06
sorry, Mark we're but we've been back and forth on this this duplication of number issue that we've had on building in Sales Order

Matthias Miller  04:16
No, I don't know I mean, I'm just gonna dig more in doesn't make sense why it's happening. But

Matthias Miller  04:26
I will hopefully I'll have time after this call to chase it because I wanted to stop

Speaker 3  04:32
when you said talk to God about it. I had this Andy Griffith moment of of Gomer Pile saying, Judy, Judy, Judy, Judy.

Matthias Miller  04:56
Are you Yeah, we're gonna check the timeline of when

Unknown Speaker  05:00
Who's to blame?

Unknown Speaker  05:03
Who created which one first?

Unknown Speaker  05:06
And which one wasn't getting detected? Okay, well already. So jumping in

Matthias Miller  05:28
row forming LLC, is that just a vendor renewing?

Speaker 4  05:33
Yeah. And maybe that's, like, what's the best way to do that we may have that occasionally ongoing. But I think this is kind of a one time thing, which is why I asked you about it instead of Wayne or Drew.

Unknown Speaker  05:48
I mean,

Matthias Miller  05:51
I don't know enough about other. I mean, as far as I know, it's as simple as just renaming this vendor record into design rentals. So

Speaker 4  06:02
there is an underlying, like, ID number that they'll all still tie out? Yes, correct. Okay, so it's that easy. It is it is that easy? Well, then I suggest,

Speaker 3  06:18
as long as we change it on both sides at the same time, I'm

Speaker 4  06:22
going to suggest that drew works with Aaron and they just coordinate that so that it's done at the same time.

Unknown Speaker  06:32
We should be good.

Speaker 2  06:35
Speaking of vendor names, Dwayne on those lists that I sent over, I assume you're just keeping the name that is in assist, not necessarily using the name that is on the list of a song.

Unknown Speaker  06:49
What are you referring to?

Speaker 2  06:53
Those, those vendor payments? I mean, it has like the default payment type. I emailed

Unknown Speaker  07:00
you. Oh, you mean for putting in

Unknown Speaker  07:02
the ACH information? Yes. Yes.

Unknown Speaker  07:07
And your question was, if I'm keeping something,

Speaker 2  07:09
are you keeping the names that assist already has? Or are you entering the name as it is on the list? I guess we should just at this point, we should just keep the name that it says has. I

Speaker 3  07:23
would have expected so although I do have questions on some of these why we're treating Calvin and Samuel as vendors.

Unknown Speaker  07:35
Just because they were in the QuickBooks vendor list. That's all

Speaker 4  07:38
it's probably because of their do we need to keep that it's probably because their weekly, like on our pay is being handled? Right?

Unknown Speaker  07:49
I think that's what that is.

Speaker 3  07:51
Well, but we're handling weekly underpaid, now through the payroll module, and those individuals have ACH transmission information on that record.

Speaker 2  08:03
I thought those were 1099. So we're not doing that with like, I missed a memo.

Unknown Speaker  08:10
Although Wow.

Speaker 4  08:17
Okay, the thing that we would have to do is if we, if we processed through that, through that through payroll module, we would have to

Speaker 4  08:32
it's going to be a little tricky, because we're going to send that information off to wait in the new payroll.

Speaker 3  08:43
Or maybe I'm making the assumption. I mean, I know that I saw emails going back and forth between somebody and somewhere to what I did was, and that was setting up Calvin and Jay and Samuel, and there was like a fixed dollar value of owner pay that was going to them.

Speaker 4  09:04
Yeah, that is correct. The idea would be that that the challenge we're going to have, I think that is the ideal to process them through that. Well, what we need to do is just tell Brittany to just pay that full amount that there's no withholdings on on pay, or no employer taxes, you just make that transaction and backfill that information with that. I think that would work.

Speaker 2  09:32
I mean, yeah, probably. But then if that's the case, why are we sending it to her?

Speaker 4  09:41
Yeah, I mean, if we'd have a clean way to pull them out of you're seeing them you may as well pay them using the ACH methods we have in a sense. I mean, it's yeah,

Speaker 2  09:55
that's alright, like Are they? Are they being paid? Something connected to the pool? Like, is that why you're wanting to keep them tied to Pharaoh? No.

Speaker 4  10:11
It okay. The reason for tying them to payroll is so that we can Well, it has the default GL accounts in the areas that are working. It has that and then it also has, it's just visibility, you can see on the weekly report, how much of how much money has been paid to each individual.

Unknown Speaker  10:30
Okay.

Speaker 4  10:34
I mean, that probably, does that bring up the question of scheduled ACH payments within assists? Which we haven't talked about that?

Speaker 2  10:43
Um, yes. And no, I mean, we wouldn't necessarily have to have any auto scheduling this list somewhere that would go by to say, hey, remember to do this and this week? Or

Unknown Speaker  10:54
a or whatever? The

Speaker 4  10:56
guys, are you tracking with us, like on that owner pay for you? With with Hang on?

Matthias Miller  11:05
So, I mean, the question is whether you send it over to QuickBooks or whether you do it.

Speaker 4  11:12
Right. And it's, it's the only reason we're sending it over to QuickBooks is basically to do the payroll process for like the withholdings and the employer taxes. Same thing we were going to do with rippling or any of those softwares. But owner pay is just a straight payout. It doesn't have to go through that. If you if you take it out of a cyst and have it paid in some other system, then you can have to bring it back in and just do a mass, which we could do that I mean.

Speaker 2  11:50
Alright, couldn't you just make a transaction to them and assign it to the whatever payroll accounts you want? And then suddenly, ACH. Maybe I'm oversimplifying. You're saying

Unknown Speaker  12:14
Right. I mean, you could create a vendor's invoice

Speaker 4  12:19
which is back to Dwayne's point, if you create a manual invoice, you have to enter them as a vendor.

Speaker 3  12:27
Which, I mean, they've over Aaron's already got them ended as vendors, I just wanted to make sure that we weren't duplicating a process somewhere.

Unknown Speaker  12:37
Oh, okay.

Speaker 3  12:38
I don't care. I don't care how you pay Calvin and Samuel, I just wanted to make sure that we have something duplicated going on. I mean, you can pay him out of marks checkbook for all I care

Unknown Speaker  12:53
for a short period of time.

Speaker 4  13:00
But do I think you need to I need to get that. Yeah, importing working? And if we get that working? Well, I think I would I'd say put put them in as vendors. But I think the cleanest way would be to do to push them out, have them paid out of QuickBooks and then just bring the transaction in along with everyone else, I think would be the point. But then, yeah, we'll test that and see if that would work. Yeah.

Speaker 3  13:35
So the so the final answer is keep them as vendors put the ACH information in there.

Unknown Speaker  13:41
Yeah, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  13:52
Okay,

Speaker 3  13:54
and, um, let's see who else was derivative, derivative derivative. It's. Well, we can put sheds 123 information in but we're about to close them out as a dealer anyway. So I don't know that it's of any value. I mean, I can put it in there. If you want it in there. It's, but I'm hoping within the next couple of weeks, we're hauling all those sheds off and moving them to a different location.

Speaker 4  14:25
Right, our goal is to have the week after Thanksgiving to pay if we're at a point where we can to pay to do the ACH payments to do the ACH and check payments for like for that week for vital structures from within assist, just as do the actual payments. And then the following week, dude for all three companies.

Unknown Speaker  14:52
Well, you're in Brave new territory.

Speaker 4  14:56
Well, it's, I mean, how bad can it be just People get to my bank account.

Speaker 3  15:03
It's pretty good, I'd say but as long as it's incoming and not outgoing, and

Speaker 2  15:09
we're trying to quit paying you 10 bucks every so often. Hey, I was

Speaker 3  15:13
I was, you know, it was it was, you know, McDonald's money. We go on testing for all I can. That's fine. Okay, so good. We'll get this updated. I think, I think drew that I have North Carolina in Indiana. And it looks like put Now there is one thing that I saw here that I'm not sure what to do with in that is that what happens when we potentially are using vendors across several different districts?

Speaker 2  15:52
Yeah, we talked about that applies? I guess that's your question, because we need to have vendors specific to the companies or the districts. Because each any, anytime that the vendor, anytime the company has an account with that vendor, it's gonna be unique, you know, shape time is gonna have a unique count number.

Speaker 3  16:16
Well, but then again, though, Drew, I guess, as long as we're transacting against the same bank account, the ACH provider is linked based on the payment type going outbound. So that payment type should be linked to an ACH processor that should reference back around, correct me if I'm wrong with eyes, but back around to the vendors of bank account information.

Speaker 2  16:39
That would work for Ach, but not for credit checks.

Matthias Miller  16:48
Think George's ultimate plan was to have one vendor per company in that case? I said Josh question, I believe I

Speaker 4  16:58
agree. But that was my thing, that we're going to end up with three sets of vendors. I think we have to we're going to have maybe see vendor Lowe's a short time and a final but so when Dwayne enters those does he have to? He needs to define that when entering those right.

Speaker 2  17:17
Yeah, but when you're working with a one list for everybody, aren't you?

Speaker 3  17:23
Well, okay, here's my question. Matthias are our youth. What I don't want to end up with is a vendor probably still will. But are we going to are we going to feel district on the vendor are we going to end up saying Alpha building center dash Indiana Alpha building center dash Ohio that seems or are we going to are we going to go ahead and feel district on to the vendor, like the vendor record? I don't know.

Matthias Miller  17:54
Gosh, question probably used to get all the vendors stuff I mean, what's wrong with having a name

Speaker 3  18:07
filtering we really ought to field it on the on the record so that we can see we can filter by like you can filter your your vendors based on district

Speaker 4  18:20
does Josh not have that? Currently, contacts record? Long term I don't see how we can how we can have only one list of vendors I think we're gonna have to have three vendor notes well, we should ask John if

Unknown Speaker  18:41
you had an accounting and accounting district field in that vendor list

Speaker 3  18:53
I think I'm suspicious that the crossover is not that many I mean, I know there's like pieces there's there's ones probably like alpha Building Center UfP Saulsbury there's going to be a few vendors but it's probably not as many as we think

Unknown Speaker  19:14
well, should I reach out to Josh and ask him

Unknown Speaker  19:19
yeah, probably so.

Speaker 4  19:31
You guys, because it somewhere we need I mean, we have accounting chart of accounts or accounting is per company. But then I have asked is universal like skews and is universal across all three companies so interesting.

Speaker 3  19:50
And so the dividing line at that point is the bill to company which divides you into the correct accounting company. Well, it Okay, I guess I guess what I would Is there is there a way we can figure out how many duplicates there would actually be if it if it literally is only a handful of duplicates then we models just duplicate the vendor records and put it in the name versus doing the work of filtering based on a district field. I don't know I I'm spitballing here this is probably a Josh conversation.

Speaker 4  20:25
Well, yeah, I think it is because Josh is currently working on synchronizing the ASIS vendor lists with what we have on our local

Unknown Speaker  20:36
computers and

Unknown Speaker  20:39
that uses one universal list of vendors so

Unknown Speaker  20:48
I'll shoot him an email see

Unknown Speaker  20:51
what he's playing on the others

Speaker 2  21:01
I guess weighing in the short term when you guys go to enter those just if it is a duplication just add ABC or vs or whatever on to the name so

Speaker 3  21:15
for the for the the Indiana one well, the one sheet you said you have alpha Building Center on here twice both for Indiana and do we have now for those who do not know neither of these office building centers has bank accounts anyway so disregard but you have two of these on this list assigned to the same district

Unknown Speaker  21:38
we're often billing centers or which one

Speaker 3  21:46
I think it was so I believe it was Indiana Ohio that well the remit state I've got one Ohio in here one Illinois but mostly Indiana. I want to say it was the Ohio one that you are the Indiana one that you send to me Yeah, no

Unknown Speaker  22:06
okay

Speaker 2  22:08
I'm assuming that was a mistake. Yeah, it was probably a copy and paste of an extra

Speaker 3  22:14
I mean it's it doesn't it doesn't impact me anyway because the only two the only two items on here that had bank account information are Samuel and in Calvin anyway, so

Speaker 2  22:24
Well, we do need a default payment information for all of them that needs to get entered the Default Payment Type

Unknown Speaker  22:33
is that on the vendor record? Yes. Oh, sure enough. Well, I'm glad you said so because I was not telling that. Yeah,

Speaker 2  22:44
no, that all needs to go in. Also, all the all the address information needs to go in as well.

Unknown Speaker  22:52
Well, here I thought we were just entering bank account information.

Unknown Speaker  22:54
No, no. So

Speaker 3  22:58
the results of this conversation if you imagine

Speaker 2  23:01
doing this for several 100 and adding all of that stuff, all that other information to the vendor record then that's, that's my start.

Speaker 4  23:09
It's not painful. Okay, good. Good. Dwayne's not going to be the one doing it?

Speaker 2  23:20
Okay, well, mine doesn't have to now anymore so you can make yours doesn't have to have those

Speaker 3  23:26
two alphabets. Give me a favor, just resend that one to me.

Unknown Speaker  23:29
Okay, I'll do that

Unknown Speaker  23:43
alright, I'm done with the rabbit trails. So Matthias says you're hiding in the bathroom again.

Matthias Miller  23:52
Audra lets you do the updates.

Unknown Speaker  23:56
Okay, sounds good.

Speaker 1  23:59
I'm going to share my screen and jump into reports

Unknown Speaker  24:04
here. That looks right. Okay.

Speaker 1  24:11
Don't think you've been through this with us, Dwayne. Since we knew. Everybody see the accounts receivable report?

Unknown Speaker  24:23
Yes, yeah. Okay, great.

Speaker 1  24:25
Can we run through and get updates on all these tasks? Mark

Speaker 4  24:36
same unchanged. Okay.

Speaker 4  24:45
The next one same as well, and then the implement the lead filling. That is, John. Okay. Dwayne, would you say there's that The only billing process that is done right.

Unknown Speaker  25:05
Well, if it's working, I think so.

Speaker 1  25:08
Yeah. So I had implement this daily billing process up here for you, Mark. And then we had said last week that this, the daily invoicing process was Dwayne's part of that. Are both of those.

Speaker 3  25:20
Done? Isn't that the same?

Speaker 1  25:23
Yeah, I wasn't sure myself.

Unknown Speaker  25:26
I think we've looked at it twice. One was for, to train in his office.

Speaker 3  25:34
Okay. The training went like this. Here's a report, click these boxes, read this report. You're done.

Unknown Speaker  25:41
Okay, so we're good on both feet exercise,

Speaker 3  25:43
we need more reports like that. I do what I can look here. There, you're done.

Unknown Speaker  25:54
Deliver? Yes. Like that.

Unknown Speaker  25:58
From a software standpoint, sure.

Speaker 1  26:05
All right, Matthias, are you in a place where you give us a stripe accounting impact update?

Matthias Miller  26:09
I think Stripe accounting impact is good to go. Duane, I did update the diagnostic report. So everything from about today, going forward should all tie out as long as people do what they're supposed to do. And you're gonna see a whole bunch of reds and oranges historically, because we're tying out not just based on stripe payment ID but also payment id plus transaction so that we can handle refunds appropriately. So I it's in yellows, quarter, I think you guys are talking about the process and make sure that the diagnostic report gets reviewed periodically. But as far as I know, I'm done.

Speaker 3  26:55
Mark, I think what I think we need to plan on talking what we need to talk about on implementation of that. Who, what, when, where and how. Okay. It's not who, what, when it's who, when, where? And how.

Speaker 4  27:13
So, talk about that on our Tuesday call, or does it? Should we need to look at it before then?

Speaker 3  27:20
No, I think Tuesday call if as long as Leanne's alone, we can talk about who we're going to implement with that, that one's going to take some work to really kind of link out that stuff and get it cleaned up well. Now, the only the only Well, I guess there was a discussion today I had with Josh that I'm a little bit concerned about. And it has to do with handling refunds inside of of stripe. And how does that how does that come across looking in this reporting in? That's, that's something we've never really talked about.

Matthias Miller  28:06
So what's, what's your specific concern there?

Speaker 3  28:13
So there's that. So stripe is weird on the IDs on when you're running a refund. Yep. Now, if Josh handles it, everything handles correctly, then I what I don't know is what stripe is going to give across in the payout information or how it handles that and the payout information.

Matthias Miller  28:34
You cross your fingers, it should all work. That's the special transaction ID thingamabob, that we implemented

Speaker 3  28:42
well, it doesn't work. That's what I was talking to Josh about on on refunds. Because

Matthias Miller  28:48
when? When was that? That was just today

Unknown Speaker  28:52
at 12:22pm.

Matthias Miller  28:56
Okay, well, I have no idea. So it might not be done. But we, but we don't know.

Speaker 3  29:03
Well. And the reason the reason this is a little bit weird, because the way stripe is handing me IDs on refunds is one wants to his tool wants to recognize it as the original transaction and which is good. Hopefully we can figure it out. Now, the only the only curious thing is that, you know, is it going to what's it going to what is stripe handing you from a PR standpoint? How does how is that reflected from, you know, a payout information standpoint is, you know, is it going to tie across correctly? So, I don't know I'm just raising a little red flag and waving it saying hey, it's something we need to pay attention to because we do run refunds.

Matthias Miller  29:50
So it's a problem in his tool that he's not recognizing the refund transaction. He's using the initial purchase transaction when you get given the ID

Speaker 3  29:57
maybe a Although stripe is not being exactly helpful from their details screen side to tell us which Id we should be, or what, I don't know what to be determined, that's just just I'm just waving a little flag saying pay attention. We need to make sure we've handled that. Who's

Matthias Miller  30:15
doing what are you checking with Josh to make sure it's resolved? Am I cheating?

Unknown Speaker  30:19
Message Josh about it.

Matthias Miller  30:22
Okay, so it's so at this point, the stripe accounting impact is still in doing squirt, and he's talking to Josh.

Speaker 1  30:30
Okay, sure, that sounds good. I'm moving it over to the adoption phase over here. I've got Dwayne and Josh on it. So next week, or potentially the week after, since next week is Thanksgiving, we can check in on it that way that works for everybody.

Speaker 4  30:43
When you can test refunds on your Kindle or pay off and just

Unknown Speaker  30:54
stripe transactions, those were ACH.

Unknown Speaker  30:56
Yeah, I stuck my foot in my mouth.

Unknown Speaker  31:02
That's okay. You just pulled the other one out.

Speaker 1  31:12
Matthias, do we have anything on stripe discrepancy? Reports? Not due for a while.

Unknown Speaker  31:17
What's next in

Matthias Miller  31:20
Dwayne in Marks court?

Unknown Speaker  31:21
Isn't that the same thing?

Unknown Speaker  31:23
Is it the same thing? Okay.

Unknown Speaker  31:28
Am I understanding what that is? Let's see.

Matthias Miller  31:34
Is if you're saying part of the straight accounting impact is to review the diagnostic report and make sure that I mean, are you going to want to review that on a regular basis? Or does the accounting just go hunting when things go sideways?

Speaker 3  31:49
You so know, if if we're still discussing the same thing we looked at the last time on on strength discrepancy reports, it's should be something that should be reviewed periodically in my office because my office is the one that that tends to generate these things. So tying off your transactions to make sure everything holds out would be really smart.

Unknown Speaker  32:16
So

Unknown Speaker  32:18
I mean, something here,

Matthias Miller  32:22
Stripe do discrepancy reports be assigned to you until you've got somebody in your office doing it?

Speaker 3  32:28
Does that sound right Mark? Yeah, it does. Yep. Oh, and FYI, Matthias, the whole thing about finding transactions, I didn't realize that you're fielding the stripe ID and you can drop the stripe ID directly into the stripe URL, and it'll pull up the original transaction. So finding original transactions is not hard.

Unknown Speaker  32:57
Okay.

Speaker 1  32:58
All right, we move on to the receive payments process. That's in the adoption stage. Last note is make sure Drew and Dwayne are happy with it you know what I know.

Unknown Speaker  33:21
Whereas this thing with us?

Matthias Miller  33:26
I mean, it's if you it's under receive payments.

Speaker 3  33:29
I should just use your fancy trick of

Matthias Miller  33:33
search menu to receive. Yes.

Speaker 3  33:37
I see that now. Current T. K sad students. Okay. Okay. All right. I guess that's in my court to adopt with individuals who are entering payments.

Speaker 4  33:53
What why you were hesitant or you felt like they might not want to use that. Then it would it would be quicker to continue going directly to the sales order and applying it there. I think last time we talked is that

Speaker 3  34:10
hit Mark put this on our list to talk about on Tuesday as well with Leanne this is going to be one that she's kind of handled this with. I think Vanessa is the one who's doing this and having her kind of understand what this is and talk this through Vanessa and see if this is a valuable tool is probably the right way to go about this. So let's let's put again, let's put that on our list and talk about Tuesday. Does

Speaker 4  34:34
she have a really wide screen so that she can see that so?

Unknown Speaker  34:41
Probably not.

Speaker 4  34:45
Alright, got it. I have it on my list for good.

Speaker 1  34:50
Okay. How about handling multiple payments for handling payments from multiple sales orders?

Unknown Speaker  34:58
That's the same thing. Y'all scored.

Speaker 4  35:04
Demo. Had you done a demo on on how that works?

Speaker 1  35:11
Okay. Okay, so what is the update here? Is it the same thing as receive payments?

Unknown Speaker  35:16
tween? Yeah. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  35:19
I mean, those those two are pretty much the same thing. Am I correct with us? Yeah.

Matthias Miller  35:28
Okay. I mean, I would, I would say that multiple SOS could fall under when it's volunteer receive payments payment.

Speaker 1  35:41
Okay, I'll link those here. So we can deal with that. Similarly, from now on, receive payment should allow searching for STI n. So IDs, it's

Unknown Speaker  35:52
been same thing.

Unknown Speaker  35:57
Well, is it done? Or is it the same thing? Done? Development? soundpoint. Okay, sounds good.

Matthias Miller  36:03
They will do something that's word

Unknown Speaker  36:08
droplist. It was is

Matthias Miller  36:15
still to do. Okay.

Matthias Miller  36:25
And then restrictions, these are all non urgent issues, the mastering. Okay, no changes.

Speaker 1  36:31
I do have this sales order raw materials cost. I have it in review and in testing, but still with you, Matthias is that? Do I need to change that somehow?

Matthias Miller  36:42
We need to find out where it's actually. Okay, that's fair.

Speaker 3  36:45
What's the risk? What's the restrictions we're going to put on on raw material cost?

Matthias Miller  36:49
So people can enter it or view it?

Unknown Speaker  36:53
He want? You

Speaker 3  36:54
don't want them? Are you? Oh, you're saying you're saying from like a restricted sales? Rep.

Matthias Miller  37:01
Yeah. Do you want your sales reps putting in raw material costs? prefer not to

Speaker 3  37:09
wouldn't make my life miserable. But Drew is definitely going to be raising red flags. No, I'm gonna second that actually. That already I think is done Matthias because I had to greet somebody restrictions or user profile. I had to upgrade you need to enter it. So I think it may be done.

Matthias Miller  37:31
Duane tested it. It's good.

Unknown Speaker  37:35
Okay, hold on a second.

Unknown Speaker  37:36
I'd have to

Speaker 3  37:38
double check that before. But I know that when we started doing the miscellaneous Sales Order Entry, I had to upgrade Nick's I had to go and upgrade the particular user profile to add it as a as a profile. addition. So yeah, I'd say it's done. Okay, who did it? How it got done? I don't know.

Speaker 1  38:00
I'm going to comment on it. Well, we had in review and testing. So I think you're probably right, that makes sense. Okay. All right. Let's jump to payroll. It's much shorter. Let's see where we got work orders show work orders.

Matthias Miller  38:16
No change in any of this. Any of those two. Okay.

Speaker 1  38:24
payroll report isn't? Well, I don't know when that's due still December 15.

Matthias Miller  38:29
Yeah, but that's we're waiting on that's actually not me. That's mark and drew.

Unknown Speaker  38:33
Okay.

Speaker 4  38:40
Yeah, that's we need to do our testing. I need to do that testing on that. It's what we what we send what we want to send to Whitney.

Speaker 2  38:50
Yes. Okay. Okay. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  38:56
I need to know what to do bottom line, okay. That works.

Unknown Speaker  39:04
better handling for paid vacation.

Matthias Miller  39:07
This is not urgent. No change. Yeah. Before GL accounts should

Matthias Miller  39:19
default GL account then I mean, then what should we do?

Unknown Speaker  39:23
You know, I

Matthias Miller  39:26
we talked about priorities and scheduling but you know, make it that it needs to be due in the near future. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  39:34
may try to put it on for middle of December maybe?

Unknown Speaker  39:38
Yeah.

Matthias Miller  39:41
Just even December 1 should be fine.

Unknown Speaker  39:43
Some rehearse. Okay.

Speaker 4  39:44
The Pharisees will prioritize between that and the first two items on the list. As far as the end user, the first two are probably more important than that. So I don't know Does that make any difference?

Speaker 5  39:59
The last shirt Oh wait two minute job are pretty straightforward Yeah, that's that's fair. Okay, that's fair

Speaker 1  40:11
that works I've been trying to tag incoming requests that new that add default account was one just to make sure that we've got things so I've got better handling for labor intensive buildings is new as of this week and core accounting groupings for balance sheet is new. Do we need to update due dates on either of these or priorities on either of these?

Unknown Speaker  40:38
Yes, we do

Unknown Speaker  40:46
so this one is

Matthias Miller  40:49
do we yeah, we have let's go back to this does it show up in my let's get back let's do a view by myself and if you by Joel and make sure that let's take a look at what actual priorities are

Speaker 1  41:06
you just okay. You mean look at your tasks and see where we're at. Okay,

Matthias Miller  41:12
so the big things I have on my list is working with Joel on the reconcile and fixing the check clinic are those still top of list priorities from from you guys

Unknown Speaker  41:35
I think so, I mean,

Unknown Speaker  41:38
the

Speaker 4  41:40
the other thing is the financial reports from from Joel the final package which may have that completed that's

Speaker 1  41:52
which are the financial reports on here my terminology isn't quite up to speed yet. What are we talking about here?

Speaker 4  42:01
I think it's the better sections on an income statement statement.

Unknown Speaker  42:05
Okay. Okay so that

Speaker 2  42:16
ACH work needs to be mostly the top I'm not sure where that all who gets that and top priority but

Unknown Speaker  42:24
that's Josh. Okay

Unknown Speaker  42:33
see what we've got for Josh. Maybe nothing right at the moment that I'm keeping track of

Unknown Speaker  42:43
see

Speaker 3  42:49
FYI, I have till 330. So if there was something specific to me in the next 15 minutes, you may want to hit that

Speaker 1  43:04
sounds good. While these two tasks if we need to we can. We can put that on hold for updating. I just wanted to make sure we were getting them slotted in correctly, then I'm done. Anything

Matthias Miller  43:28
slot into this was due dates.

Speaker 1  43:30
Yeah, due dates, probably due dates is probably how we're actually looking at priorities right now. I'm trying to use the priority tags as a indicator but due dates is really how things are getting sorted.

Matthias Miller  43:42
is labor intensive Billings. Okay, for December 15. Mark.

Speaker 4  43:47
Oh, yeah, that's I mean, is that ahead of for accounting groupings for

Unknown Speaker  43:56
it's separate.

Speaker 4  43:59
So those those can run in parallel. All of the other work on like better sanctions on income statements. The groupings on balance sheets are more pertinent than the labor intensive buildings.

Unknown Speaker  44:18
But if if moving

Speaker 4  44:23
so I don't know what is that if you have to pick between one of the three, not being done in the labor intensive buildings is the one to drop.

Matthias Miller  44:38
So the reason the reason I wanted to see Joe on my list is so that we could prioritize within the list of what they're already working on.

Speaker 1  44:47
There. I can restart that by priority if it helps or do you see what you need to see right now? Just

Matthias Miller  44:52
do it. Yeah, no, this is fine. So for me check listing in the filter drop list for handwritten sales orders. I mean check printing, check printing is the priority ACH payments

Speaker 4  45:12
Okay, the thing is that that second one, I think that one can almost go away because of the we just added the actual GL to potential GL accounts directly to the word. Dwayne's team is just keying those in so I don't know that we even well Dwayne is that do we need a filter drop list? Or are we

Speaker 4  45:46
are what what when you enter a miscellaneous sales order in your office, then you have to select your revenue account. And what this project would do is

Speaker 3  45:58
with the addition of with the addition of of writing out the actual number onto the printed sales order, we can just type it in and it comes up okay

Unknown Speaker  46:16
so this is a not to do okay. Nice. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  46:27
And then we're getting into

Matthias Miller  46:31
payroll stuff everything looks about right. Okay, Joe, Joe's list. Sorry.

Unknown Speaker  46:36
Yep, gotcha down there.

Unknown Speaker  46:41
Around toggle

Unknown Speaker  46:46
where it takes a long time to load your list with ice

Matthias Miller  46:56
reconcile process better sections. Better sections and balance sheet should go

Unknown Speaker  47:05
should go close to the top

Matthias Miller  47:10
custom warning can be probably bumped out.

Speaker 1  47:16
Let's see about the only reason this is sorted at the top is because we're saying it's overdue. So if I knock that down, we'll get better looking last year. About right.

Matthias Miller  47:38
Accepting let's let's assign the better sections on balance sheet did your

Speaker 1  47:46
groupings for balance sheets. Is that what we're talking about? Yeah, no, that's fair. Okay. Nope, that makes sense. And so we're going to say see that on Joe's list pop up. We want the due date for that to be

Unknown Speaker  48:00
next writing.

Unknown Speaker  48:06
Nice. Okay, that looks good. Okay, so

Matthias Miller  48:09
so just to confirm, reconcile process versus income statement, which one's top priority for you guys?

Unknown Speaker  48:19
What is what is the reconcile? Approved reconcile process?

Matthias Miller  48:26
I'm switching reconciles to be an event so that we can do printout, so reconciles.

Unknown Speaker  48:33
And

Matthias Miller  48:36
I guess this is in my court speeding up the unreconciled payment total, which might just be a matter of Drew, would you rather in the short term, would you rather have it be slow? Or would you rather have a column gun? Or would you rather have a column gun or would you rather have it be fast

Speaker 2  48:54
short term are we talking about? Like oh, I don't know. I mean, if it's

Speaker 2  49:08
I don't know I really can hardly use it without that without that total number in there. So So I guess I would rather have slow I mean, I won't be doing much until the rest of the system is functioning anyway. So

Matthias Miller  49:31
So really the only thing when as far as the reconciled, like the statement history

Unknown Speaker  49:44
do we need

Matthias Miller  49:50
how important is that to you?

Speaker 2  50:00
Well, is this connected with the statement date? Can I have one without the other, I mean, the date, the date is quite important to more than being able to grab the report this

Matthias Miller  50:18
point, but so if we would change it to say it was reconciled on this date, or this is the statement date and reconciliation, that would be, that'd be your

Unknown Speaker  50:30
and that would be the most improved okay?

Matthias Miller  51:06
And if you could choose between the statement end date and having the income statement wrapped up, which one would you choose?

Speaker 2  51:21
Well, Mark, the one looking at the income statements. I would rather choose to reconcile. But I don't know I I'd say

Speaker 2  51:41
well, we're just about need to get the reconciling before the end of the year before I am going to trust any of our account amounts.

Unknown Speaker  51:49
So

Speaker 2  51:51
having a pretty income statement is nice. But if it's wrong, you know, so I would I would go with reconcile. But if you want to do otherwise, Mark, go for it. Well,

Speaker 4  52:01
no, I mean, that's we do have an income statement. We can use that. Okay, the changes that you had shown us a week ago, I think some groupings, some of that is live, right. It's just not.

Unknown Speaker  52:20
Yeah, it's just not final.

Unknown Speaker  52:22
Like what? What don't we have yet?

Matthias Miller  52:29
Well, I think there's some cleanup that needs to happen. I mean, I think right now it is up to three columns or something. And I'm not sure if percentages are calculating correctly. You know, I don't even know what numbers are showing at all.

Speaker 4  52:44
But just a like that. Okay. So we don't have any history compare, again, it's just the current year, the current month, is that part is working? Or is that part working? Pretty much like we expected to?

Matthias Miller  53:01
Doing know, the No, I there's some kind of confusion around Joe thinks it's done. I'm not seeing done.

Unknown Speaker  53:14
So we need to

Matthias Miller  53:17
circle around and find out what what exactly

Speaker 4  53:24
because we don't need the necessarily need currently don't need the comparison columns. And, you know, because we have we don't have last month or last year to compare it to. There's nothing you need from us on that. Right. At the moment. No, there's not. So

Matthias Miller  53:49
Audra, I'm really confused. Yeah, I'm just confused, because I thought, did he not say that it's basically done it just

Speaker 1  54:01
he did the last update we have from Joel. Okay. So as of November 6, the only remaining piece is added validation to pray the deletion of reconcile transactions, he thinks it's pretty close to being tested. And then the other day, he mentioned that some things had gotten more complicated. So I think we were kind of stalled at this last perceived progress update of what we say somewhere between 80 and 90%. I think you're close from the last conversation we had that I don't have enough background to know any more than that.

Matthias Miller  54:35
Here's why it was blank. But we currently we are issuing percentages, month date and year to date comparisons, which is not actually what we want to see but you can export it and you can get you can delete columns if you need to, etcetera. Now, somebody did enter another 2034 transaction. So we might need to start I mean There's there shouldn't be some kind of do we want a time travel warning about 90 days into the future? And well, can you? Should you ever be able a future date a vendor invoice serve that?

Unknown Speaker  55:14
I would think so.

Matthias Miller  55:17
Is there on that?

Speaker 2  55:20
You know, it's like, Somebody just sent you an invoice. And rather than instead of having it set around, and you want to put their date that's two days into the future that they put on it, you can just go ahead and enter it and move on.

Matthias Miller  55:33
So at what point should we just figured heels in and say you can't do that? Is it? Is it week? 30 days?

Speaker 2  55:47
Yeah, I mean, I would guess that probably probably either one of those work fine. Probably 30 days would be would be handy. In case there's something I don't know. I can see it'd be usable within the first 30 days. But

Matthias Miller  56:10
it is fine to completely forbid it. Do we just want to have it be a warning? Or entering it? More than three days in the future?

Speaker 4  56:20
I think we should just forget it. Warnings seems warnings. Human Nature So just

Unknown Speaker  56:28
Yeah, but I know what I'm doing.

Speaker 5  56:31
It is Tony. Okay.

Matthias Miller  56:42
I'm gonna see if Josh can handle that because that's a runny nose.

Matthias Miller  57:14
Okay, I think that gives us Okay, so we think we're close. Okay, last thing, hopefully last thing. I am planning to be out. I should have told you guys in on this. I am planning to be out all over next week.

Matthias Miller  57:35
And I will not be able to do a checking call Friday afternoon.

Unknown Speaker  57:40
Okay, well,

Speaker 4  57:41
I'm going to be off Friday afternoon as well. So Drew and I were talking we could do would have to be before 10 For if we think we have something we can or we could make something more. But what do you guys think? Do we well go ahead and that's I kind of interrupted that's that's Friday afternoon won't work for me as well. Or after? Anytime after 10. Eastern.

Speaker 1  58:20
Well, I had sent an email earlier today just proposing that. Since I'm canceling or I cancelled all of Matthias has meetings for next week. I wasn't sure if you all wanted to get together and do any updates on Wednesday. With me. I'm going to try to meet with Joel on Monday and get more updates. But as far as next week goes, I think with people being out unless you had specific things you wanted to do, Mark but Mike Matthias just won't be around. So just let me know what you think.

Speaker 4  58:48
I suggest we just we canceled for next week.

Speaker 2  58:53
I won't be around losers. Okay. Sounds good.

Speaker 1  58:59
Well plan on sending the reports like I have been but other than that we won't we be sounds good.

Speaker 4  59:09
Don't you feel like we have something we should try and cover this week yet? Or? Like, do a meeting Friday or?

Matthias Miller  59:23
I mean, well, it just depends what my day tomorrow looks like. If I can push any of these chat changes through. It might be nice to go through some of those. So I guess in light of that, I think we should block out a time tentatively for that I could do you said you're out by 10

Unknown Speaker  59:50
Yeah

Matthias Miller  59:59
I could do You probably the best thing for me would be like a 915.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:08
Give us 45 minutes

Speaker 4  1:00:15
okay, well block that out and just bled by Eric push updates live every meeting, if not

Speaker 5  1:00:33
sounds good. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:43
All right. Well,

Matthias Miller  1:00:46
it feels like all fine and good until you look at taking a week off for Thanksgiving and then then you're like, questioning whether you should take a week off every Thanksgiving with everything going on.

Speaker 4  1:01:01
Matthias Do you have time to cover five yet? Or not? Oh, yes. I'm sorry. If we've covered everything else. I'm

Speaker 1  1:01:10
gonna drop off there. Have a good Thanksgiving. Yes. Thank you.

Matthias Miller  1:01:18
Okay, so

Speaker 4  1:01:24
I'm trying to explain what I do. Yeah, read through it and see, then we'll start from there.

Matthias Miller  1:01:36
So, bottom line is that delivery controls f g. Well, hang on. Does this create a credit to revenue debit to cogs?

Speaker 5  1:01:50
On the invoice date? FGI.

Matthias Miller  1:01:55
Debit to a or? Yes. Okay, so let's go.

Speaker 4  1:02:02
Yeah, I thought it might be most helpful if you just share your screen. And we could just do several examples because I think yeah, there was some confusion on what what does invoicing control and what does like events that happen to a billing

Unknown Speaker  1:02:19
control?

Unknown Speaker  1:02:29
Okay, so

Matthias Miller  1:02:31
this is invoiced. You've got a debit for AR Okay, well, let's let's go into the sales order. So here we have a sales order. It was invoiced on the 14th for a for 20,000 Approximately with a 5k discount. So here we have 15k, debit of AR 20k. credit revenue account.

Speaker 4  1:03:04
Okay, now that's all all correct, other than Is this a wholesale deal or one thing that we may not have? No, it's okay. So, if we had a wholesale dealer that massive just like a wholesale dealer typically has a 30 or 40% discount off of retail if we had that that would not show up as a promotional discount right. From accounting we ignore the wholesale discount, correct? Correct.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:35
That is correct. Okay, so that's that one.

Speaker 4  1:03:42
Now, what happens if we take off the if we remove the delivery date what happens then if we go to the billing and say Oh, this was not delivered like to think we do that in the transit Tez

Matthias Miller  1:04:07
Well, let me let me go check exactly how

Unknown Speaker  1:04:12
that gets handled.

Speaker 5  1:04:27
Building delivery date, delivery date

Unknown Speaker  1:04:36
not sure if that's okay.

Matthias Miller  1:04:41
I mean, that is what

Matthias Miller  1:04:59
so you The delivery date here is what controls FDI

Speaker 4  1:05:06
and when we say FDI we're not talking about the accounting side but rather the finished goods inventory list that Josh created

Unknown Speaker  1:05:15
as part of IMS

Matthias Miller  1:05:17
yes but I think it also affects here it affects getting

Unknown Speaker  1:05:28
expensed out

Unknown Speaker  1:05:41
okay, I

Speaker 4  1:05:41
think the ideal I think long term we have to think about. So, you have a sales order and whatever happens to this typically sales or as a building attached to whatever happens to the sales order glucose determines what determines the accounting impact.

Matthias Miller  1:06:04
So, really, this is not building a building delivery event. This is a building invoiced event.

Speaker 4  1:06:11
Yeah, I think so, I just wanted to talk this through with you because it was it was not working how I had envisioned it in my mind, but then I started thinking about all kinds of

Unknown Speaker  1:06:24
situations where like you

Speaker 4  1:06:28
have you have a sales order. And a skin and the two are independent of each other.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:43
Ah, yeah.

Speaker 4  1:06:53
But, okay, let's look at a few other few other things as well, before we. So on the balance sheet, okay, AR what makes a building like this case, the building appeared on our AR report because it has a delivery date.

Matthias Miller  1:07:16
So was

Speaker 4  1:07:18
the AR number on the balance sheet? where's that going to come from? Is that accompany a compiled like a an aggregated number off of all transactions? Or does that will that read off of this AR list that we have?

Matthias Miller  1:07:39
So I mean, ultimately it's an aggregated list of all transactions with the transactions would be basically the sum of all balances less payments for invoice sales orders.

Speaker 4  1:07:52
Which is correct but okay, now take a look at the accounts receivable report, the one that I attached in my email or

Speaker 5  1:07:58
bring it up what works best you will be rotated around and caught up.

Speaker 4  1:08:23
Okay, so this is where it's showing up on the sales orders need to invoice and it appears there because of the status of the stin. Like, the building status, which is correct, it's saying I think you need to invoice for this. And because it's already currently the way it's working, because we already have a delivery date, it's already moved out of the instance this was done it would have moved out of finished goods inventory. I believe now we're invoicing and seeing begin boys. Now when we go to the next report and look at the AR report. It's also showing there now if we did we took off the if we said oh the customer cancelled or the hauler. This was was mistakenly marked delivered and it's actually not delivered. We go and take off the delivery date. I think what would happen is it would it would go back on finished goods inventory would come off the AR report. But would accounting transactions Follow? Follow that?

Matthias Miller  1:09:40
Well, it would still be invoiced.

Speaker 4  1:09:45
Okay. And I think that's correct. It would still be invoiced and you still have an AR balance of 15,001 98. And then you could try to collect on it. Yeah, are you you might in the customer would say Well, I never got my building. So you And then

Speaker 4  1:10:06
Okay, so what we're saying is invoicing. Controls, invoicing is controls accounting transactions what events that happen to a building determine whether they're in finished goods or AR

Unknown Speaker  1:10:32
No

Matthias Miller  1:10:35
it's a little more complicated than that well from okay completely outside of a accounting building delivery determines whether it's in finished goods inventory or not and I'm not sure about this particular accounts receivable report

Unknown Speaker  1:11:06
oh this is a different one

Speaker 4  1:11:13
yeah this this is for Indiana I think the one you have is for a while

Speaker 5  1:11:18
okay I just changed it to oh

Matthias Miller  1:11:28
I'm not sure there's the thing Oh no, this

Unknown Speaker  1:11:30
is the state okay, it's

Speaker 4  1:11:33
a statement type report or whatever there's there's another accounts receivable reporting

Unknown Speaker  1:11:45
Document Document

Unknown Speaker  1:11:55
Yeah 45 Start

Unknown Speaker  1:12:09
yeah

Unknown Speaker  1:12:11
they are delivered with balances user shared

Unknown Speaker  1:12:23
shared counsel receivable Okay, so this one

Matthias Miller  1:12:38
is on sales orders it's not a quote and not canceled it's not complete and it has an ordered a billing name shipping name and the building has a final delivery date. So yeah. The building delivery date is what controls this one here as well.

Speaker 4  1:13:05
So, the potential would exist that the balance sheet what the balance sheet says is AR and what this says is AR would would be different correct. And the same with finished goods inventory correct. So, okay, how are we going to where are like the people taken care of, it's going to be Dwayne's office taking care of collections are we envisioning they're going to continue using this as their well okay, there's another damn like the procedural accounts receivable report which is in the same just breaks out all the Yeah, that won't take a look at that. I mean, that's what they're currently using. which just shows the pretty sure that one's using the same

Matthias Miller  1:14:13
except it's net. It's showing all buildings whether they're delivered or not. Oh, yeah. But it does look like delivery date is a key factor here. Okay,

Speaker 4  1:14:27
so delivery date is the key factor here. But the reason we we wanted to make a point in time when we said when we invoice so that it's clear when it appears on revenue and all of the other like revenue and it moves.

Matthias Miller  1:14:54
Yeah, I mean, it seems to me like the accounting impact Well as far as the accounting impact of delivery

Unknown Speaker  1:15:10
it's weird.

Matthias Miller  1:15:14
On one hand, if you deliver the building, it's nice to have finished goods inventory on the balance sheet. reflect that. On the flip side, it's nice when COGS is when it's expensed on the date of invoicing. But the question is, how do you want? Do you? Do you want to choose between one or the other? And if you don't, where does it live in the meantime

Speaker 4  1:15:45
you're saying currently the accounting impact is all driven off the invoice date or when it's invoice

Matthias Miller  1:15:58
All right, well, there's two parts to it. The the, the raw materials and the FTI

Speaker 5  1:16:08
and the cogs expenses are all driven off the building. Okay,

Matthias Miller  1:16:19
the revenue the AR customer deposits, all of that is driven off the sales order. Now, here's the weird thing. Okay. Builder builds a building on Monday. hauler delivers it on Tuesday. Wednesday, accounting invoices. Well, yeah, Wednesday accounting invoices. When does that building so on Monday, it moves from raw materials into finished goods.

Unknown Speaker  1:16:53
On Tuesday

Matthias Miller  1:16:57
it's delivered, it is no longer a finished good. But it's it hasn't been invoiced. So it's not receivable. And do you want to expense it at the point of delivery? Or do you want to wait until Wednesday when you've invoiced it too expensive because that's when you're going to be recognizing the revenue

Speaker 4  1:17:17
Well, Wednesday so that that key part of accrual accounting is the matching principle. So that like your expense, your cogs and your revenue happen at the same time.

Matthias Miller  1:17:33
So, your finished goods inventory is going to be on a one is going to be on a delay, your balance sheet is going to show more inventory is going to show all of your in one inventory plus and invoiced, delivered sets.

Speaker 5  1:17:54
As in you build a shed for

Matthias Miller  1:17:58
round numbers, keep it simple. Build a separate 5k 5k goes from from the source accounts into the FCI accounts. On Tuesday you look at your finished goods. If you run your it's marked as delivered if you look at your finished goods report and that building has been delivered it's going to drop off no salesperson can sell the building because it's not around well actually that would happen when the building is sold but but your balance sheet is going to show is still going to show that $5,000 value of the shed

Speaker 4  1:18:36
the balance sheet is still going to show that in finished goods rather than AR

Matthias Miller  1:18:43
correct and and so it'll stay in finished goods after delivery until the invoice date. With what with what we're proposing here

Unknown Speaker  1:18:56
does that matter?

Unknown Speaker  1:18:58
Well I think it potentials there for confusion between

Speaker 4  1:19:12
like if we do so if we do an audit we want to look at all of our buildings like we're planning to do an audit end of November we're going to count all the buildings that we have that have been built have not yet been delivered and so that's what accounting might show a higher yes a higher finished goods inventory value because accounting still thinks the two sheds delivered yesterday are still in finished goods inventory.

Matthias Miller  1:19:54
Okay, so we can we can do that. We need something that's the equivalent of received not vouchered like delivered Like a DNI delivered not invoiced?

Speaker 4  1:20:11
Well what why do we need that like why? Why would happen if we just simply use the invoice date as it stays on finished goods inventory until it's invoice it and then you would look for this building on finished goods inventory and it would have what if we use instead of delivery date What if we use invoice date as the trigger for for all of that and just it seems like we could simplify it we do that

Speaker 4  1:21:01
like I'm thinking you would look at your finished goods inventory report you'd say well these three buildings you know we don't have them anymore and then you you look at modification history or look at the details and say oh these were delivered two days ago and obviously this color had not marked them off so

Matthias Miller  1:21:21
now I'm just a touch confused because in one place here we are using the invoice date on the actual

Speaker 4  1:21:42
I don't know do we need to involve Josh because there was we also I also discovered that there were 374 buildings that at some point first of July that something went sideways and Josh was no longer taking those buildings when sheds Drake said here's what we were going to pay you this week Josh was no longer taking those out of finished goods inventory. So I got the list of all those trainers out of the four buildings that Josh these were paid on these dates go enter the invoice date which he did I was thinking that would take them out of inventory it did not so I said you also have to add a delivery date which he then did and those that then didn't take them out of finished goods I

Matthias Miller  1:22:39
think let me let me take a look and looking at something here just to find out where all this stuff is sews this may ultimately become a question for Josh

Unknown Speaker  1:22:58
buildings buildings year to date

Matthias Miller  1:23:17
I think it's a question for Josh and he can get in touch with me

Unknown Speaker  1:23:23
on that part

Matthias Miller  1:23:30
as far as making sure that the invoice date always controls coming off finished goods inventory

Speaker 4  1:23:42
think the question we need need to answer is how, how do we want it to work? Like how can we explain it to to people like

Unknown Speaker  1:23:52
how can we answer the questions of what makes a building come out of finished goods inventory? What makes a building appear?

Speaker 4  1:24:01
What makes what makes the building come out of finished goods inventory what makes it appear as revenue? What makes it appear on AR? What makes the cogs appear all of those

Unknown Speaker  1:24:18
What's that? What's the whole

Unknown Speaker  1:24:21
with with using invoice date for

Unknown Speaker  1:24:25
for all of those? Um

Matthias Miller  1:24:29
there's some technical reasons why it might be complicated, because we're looking at there's some performance improvements that we're doing. And we're looking at stuff on the building record to determine that.

Unknown Speaker  1:24:45
But apart from that

Matthias Miller  1:24:51
even really that big of an issue will probably be easily be reworked. I mean and then just apart from The building is physically absent, but it's still unfinished goods, kind of that more of a managerial accounting concern than

Unknown Speaker  1:25:12
anything else. Those are the two issues I can think of

Speaker 4  1:25:29
Well, I mean part of me, I feel like we want it to be not painful, but we want it to be like we get to the end of the month and we have attended, we said, well, these are not showing up on ER, they should be or these are not showing up as revenue. And we know they should be and we can say, Well, were they invoice? Well, no. Okay. They need to be invoiced in order to appear otherwise I'm concerned that we have like like, the whole market delivered to the not

Speaker 4  1:26:15
okay, you said there's technical, different or technical reasons, that might be more difficult, but then the other was for managerial accounting. Yeah, where we have to go.

Speaker 4  1:26:40
Okay, what would be the situations that we could have buildings?

Matthias Miller  1:26:48
Explaining to the builder why their his finished goods inventory is off by 30,000 Because he has a handful of buildings that were delivered on the last day of the month but not invoiced until

Unknown Speaker  1:27:06
a day or two after.

Speaker 4  1:27:10
And when you do that, like you'd see that by comparing your butt okay, if we if we make the the invoice date be the be Watkins controls when they come off and finished with the inventory, then you would wouldn't have that, would you? Nevermind,

Matthias Miller  1:27:31
you wouldn't have that because we would then invoice it as of the date of delivery.

Speaker 4  1:27:40
If you wouldn't invoice them, they'd stay. They stay in finished goods inventory, nevermind that they were to deliver.

Matthias Miller  1:27:50
Right. We're using the final delivery date. So I mean, as the as the default invoice date.

Unknown Speaker  1:28:02
Okay.

Matthias Miller  1:28:09
I'm having trouble coming up with a good reason why now? Well,

Unknown Speaker  1:28:13
I like to think before we make I mean, this, this would be a

Speaker 4  1:28:22
I don't know how substantial an overhaul this would be in how we think about things. But before we do that, I'd like to, I think we would need to put some

Unknown Speaker  1:28:32
model together just a flowchart or something, they lay it out and know how to work in the different scenarios. In review that make sure that we've got all the bases covered before we go changing a lot of

Speaker 4  1:28:53
a lot of our software, or what, what should be the next steps?

Unknown Speaker  1:29:01
Well, for me to change

Matthias Miller  1:29:07
this is to look at the invoice date. That's pretty trivial. So I mean, I think I think is a question. It is ultimately the question of how do you want it to work?

Matthias Miller  1:29:23
Because we're invoicing it on. We're defaulting the invoice date to the delivery date for most buildings. Revenue is normally recognized expenses are normally recognized in the same day revenue is recognized but we could enforce it by expensing it out on the date of invoicing.

Unknown Speaker  1:29:48
So

Matthias Miller  1:29:50
I mean, I think I think to your point I think your proposal makes sense like

Matthias Miller  1:30:03
It's pretty easy to explain that the invoicing process is a checkpoint by which a building comes off finished goods inventory. And you have to do more than just mark it delivered, you have to sign off and invoicing it.

Speaker 4  1:30:23
And that would be I guess, yeah, like that. I hadn't thought about it like that. But it would also be an action step that needs to be done on all other sales orders. You know, it's for two windows or it's not a building or it's even a delivery. Right. Well

Speaker 4  1:30:51
I think what you said, how do we want it to work? What if we would take some time to think about this and just plan to regroup Friday with or we just shouldn't just wait until we get back?

Unknown Speaker  1:31:06
to regroup on

Matthias Miller  1:31:08
the list and try again?

Unknown Speaker  1:31:14
You're saying just plan to talk about it. Right.

Matthias Miller  1:31:18
As long as it's at the bottom of the list? Yeah. We'll get to it. If not, we'll, we'll take it to take it to Monday. Good

Speaker 4  1:31:25
because I was thinking there's also work that Josh is going to need to do to change his reports. Like he's finished his inventory reports and if we go that route, and he could possibly work on that.

Unknown Speaker  1:31:39
Next week, I don't know what his schedule is, but good. bottom of the list. Sleepover. Sounds good. Good. All right. Awesome. Yeah.
