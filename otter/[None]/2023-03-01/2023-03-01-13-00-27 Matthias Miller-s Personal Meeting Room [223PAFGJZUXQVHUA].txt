Unknown Speaker  04:21
Afternoon this is.

Unknown Speaker  04:54
Hello

Unknown Speaker  05:06
longtime longtime news hey you know

Unknown Speaker  05:15
so you

Matthias Miller  05:16
come and break our reports and you still you still expect me to be willing to talk to you today

Speaker 1  05:23
so my list to talk about all your reports I broke one of yours Wow No no I broke more than one then I did

Unknown Speaker  05:33
indeed

Speaker 2  05:34
let's let's let's let's figure out how to resolve these

Speaker 3  05:44
Nick Do we have a good way to run component validation

Unknown Speaker  05:49
in the live system live system yeah

Unknown Speaker  06:03
seems like maybe I can just get it out of operations logs too

Speaker 1  06:08
yeah you can validate settings validate System Settings expression codes, ports and

Unknown Speaker  06:15
graphs so this is on the Browse page or add in

Unknown Speaker  06:33
Are you did have fun breaking them

Unknown Speaker  06:36
I'm sure you did. I have no doubt

Unknown Speaker  06:44
that Josh was signaling I left

Unknown Speaker  06:50
nice things are there we

Speaker 3  06:51
go. Okay. Some of these are under a posting menu and makes it all

Unknown Speaker  07:01
the folder let's just

Unknown Speaker  07:05
we do all folder we're going to really get ourselves in trouble

Unknown Speaker  07:16
probably should

Unknown Speaker  07:25
it

Unknown Speaker  07:39
all right. So do we

Matthias Miller  07:47
see brick and mortar teams that

Speaker 3  07:48
don't care about thanks dealer

Matthias Miller  07:56
Building Service building updates

Unknown Speaker  08:01
all baller

Matthias Miller  08:03
window delete me that's begging to be deleted sure I will

Speaker 2  08:11
Did you fix Did you fix your online lab buildings report

Unknown Speaker  08:17
okay

Matthias Miller  08:19
do you have a lot buildings report that's working I guess the live one would be

Speaker 2  08:23
well all I did is I deleted the column for your drawing and images from the what used to be the hauler locations RG so we had to figure out how to evaluate transit records for probably for either lot Hall type and completed and then pull in your your images

Unknown Speaker  08:49
you should share your screen yeah I should

Unknown Speaker  08:56
more open and sharing

Unknown Speaker  09:03
I don't know which ones I'm sharing

Unknown Speaker  09:08
Okay, not you not you. It's not you either.

Speaker 3  09:15
Are you? Are you are you are you not you? Also not you

Unknown Speaker  09:26
also not you

Unknown Speaker  09:32
Alright,

Unknown Speaker  09:34
let's try this again.

Matthias Miller  09:35
Now I actually have two browser windows to choose from suppose that

Speaker 3  09:40
Okay, so we have the building load completed date

Unknown Speaker  09:45
transit pitcher hit your transit

Unknown Speaker  09:49
Yeah, tasks. Yep.

Speaker 2  09:53
Well, that's that's your report for transit tasks are assigned. Yeah, a

Unknown Speaker  09:58
transit student IDs in Next oh look at this

Matthias Miller  10:01
okay

Unknown Speaker  10:02
we have so much fun fun fun. Okay I didn't know suffix building steppin and then MDX

Speaker 2  10:21
Are you just are you just going to evaluate all records assigned to this building for pictures? Is that what you're thinking to do?

Unknown Speaker  10:27
Yeah, so I'm thinking to do

Speaker 2  10:30
which I really well let's I'll let you finish that's that's not

Unknown Speaker  10:33
all images

Unknown Speaker  10:41
concat RG transcom

Unknown Speaker  11:16
you want to know what's crazy?

Speaker 2  11:19
To me. Remember when we went down this rabbit hole and we said this is going to take way too long to build. That's exactly what we built

Unknown Speaker  11:28
sure where he is.

Speaker 2  11:31
I mean, it's short of short if we didn't do accessory records, we solved that conundrum a little bit differently. I would have preferred accessory records but whatever. It was the only thing I didn't get amongst the laundry list of things we did do. Dude, we went and made the hauler portal offline capable

Matthias Miller  11:53
Josh told me about that

Unknown Speaker  11:54
yeah

Unknown Speaker  11:57
just a small little tidbit of fun we had

Unknown Speaker  12:02
for you as a Rails number is pipe list

Speaker 2  12:14
fair warning there's going to be a couple on Oh this was on Ohio. So then nevermind. There's so we apparently there used to be an indication when you were uploading images that you uploaded the image image and it somehow got removed so all those like it's not uploading it's not uploading so you went to the record and it's like 17 pictures on there it's like yeah, I think it was uploading

Unknown Speaker  12:41
it's like got it

Speaker 1  12:43
didn't number buildings didn't number buildings didn't number buildings didn't number buildings like over and over and over and over. It's not

Unknown Speaker  12:48
working like that

Speaker 2  12:56
is that is that macro global that I can grab it and throw it into brick and mortar oh you're just doing it this upset.

Matthias Miller  13:06
So this would be a

Unknown Speaker  13:10
building

Matthias Miller  13:11
transit photo

Unknown Speaker  13:13
demo

Unknown Speaker  13:30
it will affect other people who have been affected. And

Unknown Speaker  13:39
Marcus? Rep text rabbit Rabideau

Matthias Miller  13:51
Billy's NaVi that

Unknown Speaker  13:55
one wish you

Matthias Miller  13:57
a merry Christmas.

Unknown Speaker  13:58
Don't quit your day job.

Unknown Speaker  14:02
Hey, you know,

Matthias Miller  14:05
a bit of makeup and some auto tune and you'd be surprised how far I go.

Unknown Speaker  14:11
Ya know

Unknown Speaker  14:18
that joke had too many connotations to way too many connotations.

Speaker 3  14:24
We do really good building delivery status. Or this is for fun, fun, fun.

Matthias Miller  14:35
I don't even know how this

Speaker 2  14:37
wait before you go do that. You may want to I think there's a macro coming that does that in the next update. I think

Unknown Speaker  14:50
don't I don't even know.

Unknown Speaker  14:53
It gives you the scheduled date.

Speaker 2  14:55
Yes, it was scheduled date. Yes. Yes. Because I asked Whereas for the for the for the RTO pipeline and it should come in in the next update I think it was that I'm not 100% sure

Unknown Speaker  15:14
that is a

Unknown Speaker  15:16
Is there is there a way to see what he's about to bring live

Speaker 3  15:21
why is that Nick can look it up if he wants to

Unknown Speaker  15:32
quote Malaccan first is

Unknown Speaker  15:33
empty

Matthias Miller  15:35
there is no trash oh good showing the link even if there's a transit task right

Speaker 2  15:38
well that link doesn't currently work either so but look hit the transit task or hit the hit the transit task report Yeah, we didn't migrate everything from the locations RG because there's like a bunch of stuff we just left behind

Unknown Speaker  15:56
building field

Speaker 2  16:02
Nick I don't remember what it's called but it would be probably a macro based on the sit well no you're looking for the bill are you looking for you're on the building record level

Unknown Speaker  16:14
here I am on the ways

Unknown Speaker  16:20
because I think that I think the macro is for the sales order level

Speaker 2  16:30
but it's a macro that was going to be written for the sales order level to evaluate the an open transit test scheduled date

Unknown Speaker  16:42
we are doing all modifications to the building record but we actually want is

Unknown Speaker  17:04
we also need changes to the transit record

Unknown Speaker  17:20
and then the status built

Unknown Speaker  17:34
so transit scheduled delivery date

Unknown Speaker  17:38
transit,

Unknown Speaker  17:39
it's on the sales order level

Speaker 3  17:44
I don't want it there. So this is if activity level equals activity record level

Unknown Speaker  17:55
building and

Speaker 3  17:58
and then if activity record level equals Tran

Speaker 3  18:10
transit task and then on the transit task the load completed date would be transit completed date

Matthias Miller  18:28
be the completed date it would be the

Unknown Speaker  18:32
scheduling date transit scheduled date and then the confirmed date

Matthias Miller  18:50
and then the building look status of that scheduling notes or is that something else

Speaker 2  18:54
so scheduling notes is what gets tied into the hauler portal internal notes or any notes regarding from internal office stuff hauler notes hauler notes are what come back from the hauler

Unknown Speaker  19:07
so I'm going to guess that

Matthias Miller  19:08
the transit looks status I went transit notes are doing what did not want

Unknown Speaker  19:12
notes at all

Matthias Miller  19:15
Oh like when they say pick out all caps pending or all caps site check or you know things like that.

Speaker 2  19:23
Would you be expecting to see notes that would be communicated to the hauler or notes that were happening inside the office inside the office I think if you want internal notes then probably what you want

Speaker 3  19:36
okay. So then we need a piece from clipboard we would have a look transit field fields such as transit transit completion let's do like transit

Unknown Speaker  20:09
stick transit notes yeah

Unknown Speaker  20:15
transit TAS

Unknown Speaker  20:21
this is a

Speaker 3  20:25
this guy becomes completed delivery on so the completion date would be this guy scheduled date is

Unknown Speaker  20:44
if confirmed

Unknown Speaker  20:54
you just use the checkbox because we already have that

Unknown Speaker  20:58
if scheduled date

Unknown Speaker  21:11
if it's

Unknown Speaker  21:18
wait if if it's Sunday we mean if it's

Matthias Miller  21:27
not Sunday then it's tentative delivery for that date.

Speaker 2  21:31
Now she puts a lot of stuff on Sunday as the tentative delivery date as as a way to group things together. So wait a minute what Wait, what are you asking? Let me make sure I before I shoot them out of concat is delivery

Matthias Miller  21:48
if it's on Sunday then we say it's tentative delivery for Sunday but that's not correct. Sunday means there is no tentative delivery we should show it if it's not Sunday then it's tentative delivery for that date

Speaker 2  22:02
you also accounting for assignee and confirmation as true that's completed on confirmed delivery for what's your what's your transit confirmed you should also add assignee in there

Unknown Speaker  22:22
just as an extra

Unknown Speaker  22:30
sure there you go.

Speaker 2  22:32
And tentative tentative can be I'm I was evaluating tentative to be if there's a color assigned and there's a date assigned but it's not confirmed that's considered tentative as long as it's not Sunday

Unknown Speaker  22:45
to holler

Matthias Miller  22:49
okay so if so anytime you have let's just

Unknown Speaker  22:54
do this

Unknown Speaker  23:20
transit building field there you go should be impressed I wrote that macro

Speaker 2  23:28
rocket just because just because I went and copied a very similar macro

Unknown Speaker  23:36
that's how it still works

Speaker 2  23:38
like oh so building field or building so field that's pretty much the same methodology

Unknown Speaker  23:52
that's actually what I wanted transit

Matthias Miller  23:57
what is scheduling notes scheduling notes

Unknown Speaker  23:59
is what gets a song assigned to the hauler portal

Unknown Speaker  24:03
what's good try look

Matthias Miller  24:18
Lingfield low building built status

Unknown Speaker  24:20
Okay, so let's

Speaker 4  24:29
okay 26 We seven oops. You don't have something right. Well, is it really

Speaker 2  24:44
hard Oh, you're hard coded the true point online actually widen, widen your your contact dealers to other tripoint dealers and you'll get an evaluation but then you can go back to your your true point online.

Unknown Speaker  25:14
I don't know that I want to open it up yet

Unknown Speaker  25:17
I mean just just just for temporarily to evaluate

Unknown Speaker  25:21
There you go works to

Unknown Speaker  25:27
portable Self Storage

Unknown Speaker  25:37
why are these all

Unknown Speaker  25:40
well that seems to be wrong What's wrong look email body

Speaker 3  25:49
sales rep statuses loop sales revenue email, sales rep expression

Unknown Speaker  25:56
building so you have an opportunity

Speaker 3  26:03
sales order opportunity Id get the opportunity salesperson.

Unknown Speaker  27:20
No I had

Speaker 3  27:30
sales rep statuses see grouped by first of all the x part either of these transit task levels find

Unknown Speaker  27:47
we have status we have the sales rep

Speaker 3  27:59
and the sales order sales order salesperson so it's all based on the sales orders salesperson

Unknown Speaker  28:19
let's do this

Unknown Speaker  29:00
it really doesn't like that at

Unknown Speaker  29:02
all request date

Unknown Speaker  29:08
so would you not have had oh well

Unknown Speaker  29:17
can't fix wrong you can't fix wrong

Unknown Speaker  29:36
that's looking a little better. Maybe

Unknown Speaker  29:46
why doesn't the body of the email change though?

Unknown Speaker  29:49
Your name is changing

Unknown Speaker  30:08
Email

Speaker 3  30:44
sales rep email like this shouldn't be showing up from more than one

Unknown Speaker  30:59
I don't know maybe I should let's do this let's try this let's change this just to

Unknown Speaker  31:18
it totally doesn't make sense how

Unknown Speaker  31:27
Oh

Unknown Speaker  31:41
something to do with it

Speaker 3  31:52
let's go to I know I saw some no those were not 24

Unknown Speaker  31:59
Okay here we go

Unknown Speaker  32:07
okay let's go to a

Unknown Speaker  32:10
built on

Unknown Speaker  32:17
what are these called

Speaker 4  32:30
dates to 22

Unknown Speaker  32:43
Whoa We got mad about that.

Speaker 4  32:46
Oh 221 sent on do to me to say Greg Kennedy built on. Okay, I'm gonna say theoretically that's working

Unknown Speaker  33:04
switches back to the mail merge so that we

Unknown Speaker  33:11
leave it as wonder why it's still not sending

Unknown Speaker  33:17
Okay, well that was fun.

Unknown Speaker  33:18
That sounds like something I would have would have done.

Matthias Miller  33:24
Okay, so those reports are

Unknown Speaker  33:27
so this started breaking

Unknown Speaker  33:33
Wednesday of last week.

Unknown Speaker  33:36
Yeah. 23rd.

Unknown Speaker  33:41
That's, that's really when we did

Unknown Speaker  33:42
the first migration.

Matthias Miller  33:47
So I really want to do this. I should be doing 22 Slash 2223 24

Unknown Speaker  34:05
Send these

Speaker 4  34:11
25 678

Speaker 4  34:31
and then we're caught up. Okay, good.

Unknown Speaker  34:36
What else?

Speaker 2  34:38
All right, let's talk about doing the photos thing, right. Mike and I talked about this thing today. I think, Okay, here's, here's what I think we should do. The same way the transit record has the attachment section with the add button on there to add images. I think we should have something identical to that on the building record. And that's what gets called in Here's the little caveat that I really, really want. I want dealers to be able to upload those pictures. Like so that building shows they go out there with a smartphone, click, click, click, click, come in here, click Add zip, zip, zip, zip, zip up, they go.

Matthias Miller  35:14
Do they need to?

Unknown Speaker  35:21
Already thinking?

Matthias Miller  35:25
So they just take photos, take photos on their cell phone and bring it in, and then they know which buildings which? Or do they go out and say, this one? That one let me upload the photo and it attaches from their phone.

Speaker 2  35:42
I think it's well, okay. If If we say we put the attachments RG on the building record, and even if dealers just drop them to us, and we add them, and you give me the VIN number and told me to add it, I don't know. i But this thing of Holic tying in hauler images is just not

Unknown Speaker  36:07
ideal. Why?

Unknown Speaker  36:10
They don't take good pictures. Half the time,

Speaker 2  36:14
on lot deliveries, it's like they take a picture of the stand and one tick picture of the building. Well, for the most part, for a dealer, that's pretty useless.

Unknown Speaker  36:24
What's the dealer looking for?

Matthias Miller  36:26
They're looking for photos.

Speaker 2  36:27
It's your interlock. Okay, so it's like all the truepoint wants to sell off each true point. Other Other true points, lots. So, and Marissa and Tory want to sell off truepoint lots as well. So they're looking for high, they're looking for decent images to be able to send out to customers.

Matthias Miller  36:42
Okay, the pitch you were making earlier was dealers need to be able to quickly find it. The pitch, Mike is saying is we need pictures, we can send the customers who aren't on location so that we can sell them and we're looking for sales where the photos

Unknown Speaker  36:58
what's the difference? But I mean, if

Matthias Miller  37:02
if I just want to know like, if I have a customer, and I just want to know, I want to go in and instead of like, instead of digging through all kinds of numbers and letters and descriptions, I just want to visually identify which building the customer is interested in. I don't care if it's a delivery photo or not.

Speaker 2  37:18
Well, Oh, yeah. No, it granted. I mean, essentially, what the last piece that I really want for for on that RG is a primary button, and we just click a primary button. And that's what gets called for the thumbnail on the dealer portals.

Matthias Miller  37:39
By the way, is Ohio using the CRM?

Unknown Speaker  37:43
No. Are they going to ever?

Unknown Speaker  37:50
I don't have a crystal ball. I hope so.

Unknown Speaker  37:53
Okay, cool.

Unknown Speaker  37:55
I mean, we're in two thirds of the districts now. Yeah. Good.

Speaker 2  38:07
We'll get to that number. No, I mean, this is okay. So but okay, backing up, you thought I was talking about the thumbnail for for a lot buildings. Right. That was our last conversation about this. No, I'm talking about saleable photos, which sort of one of them I want to be able to grab as the thumbnail. Which I guess, I guess if, if this is, if we're going to tie this all out to s3, then tying in one of those images as a thumbnail is what? Impossible, right?

Matthias Miller  38:43
Well, what would be easiest would be if

Unknown Speaker  38:52
well, which no,

Speaker 2  38:53
I mean, that's fine. I mean, here's the thing if if dealers upload images and say hey, Addison or Hey, Nick, image such and such, please go make that one my my thumbnail image we just, you know, grab it and drop it in.

Matthias Miller  39:06
Well, I mean, you can even give a report of what are all the things that don't have an image but have attachments and go

Unknown Speaker  39:13
pick that somebody's job.

Speaker 2  39:16
Sure, but then again, I guess it well. Anyway, no, this is not about the thumbnail, this is about sale images across and and this will be used 100% By

Unknown Speaker  39:29
all districts. Because cuz

Speaker 2  39:33
Indiana's buggin for it, I promise you if I if I say hey, dealer, here's your, here's your images, go upload them. And you can store nice images to send out to customers. I think every single dealer is going to be using it.

Unknown Speaker  39:47
Yeah.

Matthias Miller  39:52
Okay, so what's the issue? How to do it. Go do it.

Speaker 2  39:58
Now, the issue is Can Can we have some type of x 30? That loads images in from the dealer port from the restricted dealer portal where we don't need to go to the building record to do it? It's probably not an X 30. But

Unknown Speaker  40:16
no, it would be a

Matthias Miller  40:20
the Add link is just

Unknown Speaker  40:22
a it's a weird good thing.

Unknown Speaker  40:26
Whiskey link, so that's fine. That would actually work.

Matthias Miller  40:31
And then on the attachments, we could do a knit, couldn't we do a repeat our G report? You pull up a building repeat our G report with a no the Delete even the Delete is a link right? Yet is Yeah. So you just replicate the RG? Well, you would we would either have a way that you would just pop open into the RG or we would replicate the RG and a report. But as far as I know. I mean, this is something that you can either go ask Josh to say, Hey, Josh, can you add attachments to

Unknown Speaker  41:17
buildings or

Unknown Speaker  41:20
Nick could probably figure it out fairly easily. It's a pretty generic.

Speaker 2  41:26
I've learned all Josh's time for this sprint site. I'm not gonna get anything out of him. Anytime, anytime. I have to say I absolutely love how much that he has he gave to me on this run. But you know, everything comes at a price.

Unknown Speaker  41:46
So, so let's do this

Speaker 2  41:57
I mean, is that do you agree? That's the right way to go about it? Or do you think there should be another way to do it?

Unknown Speaker  42:06
Well, I mean, if I mean, it seems

Matthias Miller  42:09
reasonable to me that if these are sales photos, I mean, I think I mean it seems reasonable to me.

Speaker 2  42:18
I mean, it seems really janky to go to like to build some sort of disconnected photo compilation spot for dealers that dumped stuff in

Matthias Miller  42:32
Okay, so let's go to the building record.

Unknown Speaker  42:36
Stop it.

Unknown Speaker  42:41
Building

Matthias Miller  42:45
should this be is this specifically for photos? Should we call it photos?

Speaker 2  42:49
Photo attachments? Sure. Such Yeah, the lot sales lot photos. So I don't know call it something. Something like that photo attachments.

Unknown Speaker  43:10
MIT memo,

Speaker 2  43:13
I just figured that with some sort of special you know, coding language.

Unknown Speaker  43:17
Holy moly.

Matthias Miller  43:20
That's what my late wife tells me to go do to the line.

Unknown Speaker  43:25
Go movie.

Matthias Miller  43:45
Okay, so let's talk a little bit about what's the interface for

Unknown Speaker  43:51
uploading these.

Speaker 2  43:56
So the same way that he did there was the attachment then can that would that actually work for

Unknown Speaker  44:04
for this

Matthias Miller  44:05
should? It should, but the question is, how do they find the building in the first place to upload?

Unknown Speaker  44:10
It would be on their lot report.

Matthias Miller  44:13
Oh, okay. So

Unknown Speaker  44:15
it's based off the lat building report.

Unknown Speaker  44:21
The nones this one

Matthias Miller  44:25
that we're just going to copy,

Speaker 2  44:27
it's the it's Well, yes and no, but I mean, it's the one that's like you and I are both using very similar ones. Maybe it's even the same. I think maybe you and I are using the same one. I don't know. Let me not. But no, we're not. Yeah, that one. Well, the one you're looking at.

Unknown Speaker  44:44
I mean, do we pick mine? I don't care. Can we make this this thing standard?

Unknown Speaker  44:51
You're not tying you're not currently tying in a thumbnail?

Unknown Speaker  44:56
No. Good luck

Unknown Speaker  45:05
now the diagram

Speaker 2  45:07
the only thing about the only thing about tying that to making this one standard is I don't want to replace the lot building report that's there well I mean I guess you could in some way because you're we're using this for with restricted ask prompts. So

Matthias Miller  45:24
can I add my photos column to yours?

Speaker 2  45:26
Okay. Yes you can because I deleted yours but in order to make mine work again till we till we got this figured out

Unknown Speaker  45:34
there you go. Rapid Okay, so

Speaker 2  45:40
you had it there before or we had it was there before I deleted it right when we broke everything so that they would have their lot reports

Matthias Miller  45:50
gave it let me see if I liked how you're doing the

Unknown Speaker  45:57
cheers is not contact

Matthias Miller  46:07
we're gonna have to standardize make all these user macros. I mean I'll make all these catalog macros Okay, well it needs to happen. I mean don't We don't we want to make this a standard report?

Speaker 2  46:20
Yes, we do want to make it a standard report but it doesn't it wouldn't have to be on the menu though. Right? We just put it would just be a standard report is that what you're thinking

Matthias Miller  46:33
I think you wanted to

Unknown Speaker  46:36
sorry, I'm in the wrong sales

Speaker 2  46:42
is so I the only thing I would say is I would want to compare the lat building report make sure the subsets are actually working the same. I'm assuming they are but

Matthias Miller  46:56
it was just one building available for sale and

Unknown Speaker  47:02

Unknown Speaker  47:28
oh man

Unknown Speaker  47:32
What's the standard report? What's what's what else is in there? That's a value

Matthias Miller  47:37
that was just broken down into columns.

Speaker 2  47:40
Like we're doing the retail price current location it's grouped

Matthias Miller  47:46
by current location you can probably group it by different stuff if you want to

Unknown Speaker  47:51
Yeah, I can't I don't know.

Speaker 2  47:53
Okay, well it can we can we make it so that well I guess well the grouping still show up if it's a single person only I don't know little well I guess it oh it is it is that way so Okay, nevermind yeah fine

Unknown Speaker  48:20
if we regret it there's always

Speaker 1  48:23
there's always go back and making use of report again

Matthias Miller  48:27

Matthias Miller  48:39

Well then you'll have a Delete to delete this one, delete and upload.

Unknown Speaker  49:48

Speaker 2  49:50
I don't know if I like it right. There's so many is going to accidentally click the Delete instead of the photo.

Unknown Speaker  49:55
Do you want the upload right there? Sure.

Speaker 2  50:00
I'm fine with the upload right there. Although that means they can never delete them that's what you're saying.

Matthias Miller  50:07
Or we have to have a separate interface to

Unknown Speaker  50:12
see what you're saying okay,

Unknown Speaker  50:16
if you click Delete, is it going to just straight out delete or whether it be a verification?

Matthias Miller  50:21
I guess it's a verification drop me a try.

Unknown Speaker  50:25

once once you have the new RG then we'll convert to the attachment photos

Unknown Speaker  51:46
well I guess you can

Unknown Speaker  51:48
whatever you're gonna call it you can code it in

Unknown Speaker  51:55
Oh, wow. I was aggressive

Unknown Speaker  52:00
it is column two.

Unknown Speaker  52:26
Side by

Speaker 2  52:27
side question. Did you guys recently write a a spell checker into the software?

Speaker 4  52:34
We've had it for eons Yeah, but like

Speaker 2  52:37
before it was like weird things would happen like you would go to use it and it would like not stay in. Okay, fine. Yeah, and

Matthias Miller  52:48
I don't know they might have made they might have made fixes to it but

Unknown Speaker  52:55
it actually works now

Unknown Speaker  53:10
okay, yeah, happy diggin vendor approval.

Unknown Speaker  53:18
So Nick you'll have it in by tomorrow

Unknown Speaker  53:22
Oh yeah, definitely not a shadow of a doubt Yeah. Yeah

Unknown Speaker  53:33
it's epic

Unknown Speaker  53:47
I'm sending it off to Josh and Alice to prove boom. Well, that leaves

Matthias Miller  53:53
us with 10 minutes over in six minutes before the next call. What else do you want to solve in the three minutes we have remaining?

Speaker 2  53:59
So Floyd keeps blowing me up saying that leads aren't coming in. He says he went to the website he filled out the type form in his own zip code and it never came to him. So I'm assuming there's a there's a whole lot of assumptions when I say that so after I was gonna get off this call, I was gonna go test and see what I can figure out but since I'm talking to you

Unknown Speaker  54:25
too.

Speaker 2  54:38
All right, there wasn't a day I thought I saw it. Floyd mullet 4026 You may see the contact who is assigned to

Unknown Speaker  54:49
read knowledge. Why don't need

Unknown Speaker  54:54
a science. Am I doing something wrong?

Matthias Miller  54:57
I don't know. But these guys have been I'm a little grouchy about our ad performance. And like, I don't know what's anyway. So if it's a good routing, it's

Unknown Speaker  55:09
a good routing.

Matthias Miller  55:10
It's not in the Indiana district.

Speaker 1  55:13
Well, actually check. Laporte Plymouth isn't

Unknown Speaker  55:17
on here. I mean, that would probably

Unknown Speaker  55:21
click at it first and then go look at it. Oh, please tell me I didn't do something stupid. Yet Plymouth is not

Matthias Miller  55:29
in here. That would probably put a hurtin on his on his leads.

Matthias Miller  55:39
Blame

Speaker 2  55:39
if you want to know, my fault, it's my fault. I know exactly what happened. Yell at me, just just just yell at me.

Matthias Miller  55:47
If you want to put a bug in their ear. One of the things I'm pitching to them is saying, Look, most of the a significant amount of the advantage that you get by having me involved in your marketing and your sales. And the softer side is that we actually have integration. And when things like this, and we can have if we would have daily calls with the salespeople in Indiana, like we do in North Carolina, these things would bubble up to the surface and get fixed instead of people getting grouchy and wondering what is going on. So when you want to pitch that idea to them,

Speaker 2  56:18
This is not your fault. So So pipe down. Well, this is my this is my fault. Because Wayne asked me to move because the the fortwayne guy lasted all of two weeks and decided to go sell for somebody else asked me to move the leads over and apparently I did something stupid. I don't know what I did. And I gotta go figure out what I did. Was that Nate?

Unknown Speaker  56:40
Ah, yeah. Oh,

Speaker 2  56:44
he's a fantastic salesperson. He can sell buildings, like fantastic, but I think he had an expectation that it was going to be way more exciting than what it was and this guy is like it Go Go drink about six Red Bulls. And you'll be you'll be hitting the groove that's that'd be about it. Oh, well.

Matthias Miller  57:05
I haven't interacted with him a lot. I got enough of enough of a flavor from what little personal interaction so you know, yeah. If you can hurt can't manage.

Speaker 2  57:17
Can you do we have something that I can go back and find these leads once I go fix the stupid my stupid mistake and go reassign them?

Matthias Miller  57:25
Yes, when you do this, the lead management reassignment report where it starts showing

Speaker 1  57:34
this baby right here let's start I think this one salesperson

Matthias Miller  57:38
it should show who it's calculated to

Unknown Speaker  57:40
be

Unknown Speaker  57:42
got it?

Unknown Speaker  57:44
No

Matthias Miller  57:46
I don't know if you want I'm very interested in helping them fix this so

Speaker 2  57:53
well I'm very interested in going and fixing my own mistakes so please give me something to go fix it because now I feel really embarrassed because I know when that happened and no wonder they're not getting leads. Well

Matthias Miller  58:03
if it helps any I'm also responsible for them having like 25 to 50% Higher lead costs in January because of

Unknown Speaker  58:10
my group so

Matthias Miller  58:13
we're even man

Unknown Speaker  58:19
I don't know how it exactly happened

Speaker 3  58:20
you know, Nick, high stakes projects can be good and bad.

Speaker 2  58:31
It's like this when people spend a lot of money and have high expectations you don't get a lot of leeway for screwing up

Matthias Miller  58:41
well the way around it is putting as much checks and balances in place and if you ever get caught without them then you Wow

Speaker 2  58:49
Yeah. Where are we? Oh side side question email and SMS imports were you add on that?

Matthias Miller  58:58
It's coming mid mid next month.

Speaker 2  59:00
Got it. Wait, wait so this report you sent to me I should once I go fix my latest. I can I can evaluate

Matthias Miller  59:08
No, give me one second here. Sorry.

Unknown Speaker  59:13
I can't believe this happen. This makes me

Unknown Speaker  59:15
furious.

Unknown Speaker  59:18
You know, you don't want the most infuriating part about it.

Unknown Speaker  59:23
It was my fault.

Unknown Speaker  59:26
Like I like finding things that are not my fault.

Matthias Miller  59:31
My fault, okay. There is there is this macro that given a zip code in a district one or more districts will tell you who the dealer is supposed to be.

Unknown Speaker  59:42
And and if you want

Matthias Miller  59:46
to wrap it one more time, just get dealers for that. So here let's go fine. Let's go.

Unknown Speaker  59:53
How much time do I have?

Matthias Miller  59:58
I'm talking to LSI I can hear let's do this.

Speaker 1  1:00:02
Let me go so I think you may currently be on the phone I can do a check for you. Okay. And yeah, sales

Unknown Speaker  1:00:07
territories and then just go reload this thing. I cannot believe this happen.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:16
Plymouth okay,

Matthias Miller  1:00:19
you're I got this for you and just context

Unknown Speaker  1:00:24
here is who we

Unknown Speaker  1:00:31
all right. I'm going to do this

Unknown Speaker  1:00:35
over written this thing I don't understand.

Matthias Miller  1:00:40
So you're gonna see here, like, here's one, Henry should have gotten this one. And so if you put this in, then you can then you'll see which ones that was reassigning.

Speaker 2  1:00:51
The salesperson doesn't automatically is not going to send out emails though, right? Not an email though, right? That only that only triggers at the initial contact. Is that right? Correct. Yes. But okay, because Okay, so reassigning that to Henry would be fairly useless because he'd never see it anyway.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:10
Correct. Okay,

Matthias Miller  1:01:13
but now you have a report to fix it.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:16
Is that the one you sent to me? Yep.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:19
Okay,

Speaker 2  1:01:21

Speaker 2  1:02:25

Unknown Speaker  1:02:38
No I did that.

Unknown Speaker  1:02:41
Where is

Matthias Miller  1:02:47
fine this one oh, he's not in this report. Cuz he was in the round robin guy.

Unknown Speaker  1:02:56

Unknown Speaker  1:04:23

Matthias Miller  1:04:35
So just go by just sort by proposed primary rep. Go find Floyd, go sign them all over. This would also substantially this would also substantially this is just gonna help her lead prices

Unknown Speaker  1:04:54
Well, it looks like I've got some work to do.

Speaker 2  1:04:58
Okay, this Where did you save this thing? Is it underneath your management,

Unknown Speaker  1:05:01
yeah, it's my management.

Speaker 2  1:05:04
Got it. Okay. I will go and assign this stuff. I have major egg on my face. It's absolutely

Unknown Speaker  1:05:11
frustrating.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:13
Dude, here's the thing.

Speaker 4  1:05:17
Did you know that that what is it? One minute of

Matthias Miller  1:05:26
disappointment and or negative negativity or beating yourself up enters your immune system for something like 24 hours.

Speaker 2  1:05:32
Why? Why is Marcus Beiler showing so many what he does not have anything assigned to him I don't know.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:46
Why is Why are those going through? I've noticed

Matthias Miller  1:05:52
I don't know. I need to dig into my owns round robin stuff. It looks like halos. Hey, how's it going? All right. Hey, how are you? Pretty well. How are you?

Speaker 2  1:06:04
Oh, we're problem solving for a big huge mistake that I just made. And it's so much fun to find out when you did something wrong. Welcome to light. Embarrassing. All right. So but Matthias you're confident that I can use this to go fix Floyd stuff?

Unknown Speaker  1:06:23
I mean, yeah, I mean, you

Matthias Miller  1:06:26
just clean these up and they'll show up in his pipeline. And it sounds like I've got some things to Jason my own as far as when Marcus is getting. Well, Mark is me.

Speaker 2  1:06:38
I was almost I was gonna make a snarky comment. Alright, I'm out of here by later.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:45
