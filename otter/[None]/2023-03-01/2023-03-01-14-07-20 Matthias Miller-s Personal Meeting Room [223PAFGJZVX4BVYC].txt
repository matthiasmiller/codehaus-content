to Josh a bit about, about affordable barns, and he thinks we should try to keep jolla out of this, partly because his roles is is specializes in complexity. And so you know, in something like accounting, it makes a lot of sense. But having him work directly with them is going to probably head things in directions we don't actually want. Yeah. And what we do instead is maybe for the eight months, eight months between when well, it's really two, three months stretches, basically three months in the fall, and then another three months next year, when we don't have access to, to, to Nick, we asked code crafters in Bangladesh for a senior developer who could do some component work for us. And yeah, so that's, that's kind of what we're thinking. And it may require some night hours for the developer, but it'd be kind of a fun project for them probably so I think that makes sense to me and then see by in just over a year, we're going to have Lord willing have Jonathan coming on full time and he's sharp, so um, he's fresh, but he's sharp and so I'm I'm pretty optimistic that he'll be able to start picking these up and, and I just think, in general, affordable barns makes sense to keep stateside but I think if we would give you a, you know, a top tier C++ developer, then it'd be you know, someone who can communicate well and is good. That'll be fine. Yep.
