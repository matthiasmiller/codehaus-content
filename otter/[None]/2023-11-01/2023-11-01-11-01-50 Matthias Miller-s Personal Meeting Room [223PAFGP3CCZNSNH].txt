Unknown Speaker  00:38
Hello, hello. Hello, right

Matthias Miller  00:52
I wonder if Yeah. Thinking jumping in here. If we could do a little bit of a project update? And are you ready to do things that you want to? Yeah,

Speaker 1  01:09
I think so. That'd be in one of the 15,000 tabs I have open. Okay. Yeah, I think this week, I don't know if everybody was able to see I sent various versions of some status reports. And I think the most important question for me this week is what kind of reports do I need to generate? And what kind of updates should we do on this call task wise? Is it just accounts receivable and payroll? Or I realized I should have also sent a report that had due dates for all tasks, and that probably would have been a better way to go about it. So I'm thinking maybe that would be better for next week. Does anybody have any thoughts on what, what they would like to see going forward here? And then we can jump in on some updates?

Matthias Miller  02:13
Now, all right. I think that would do that. It sounds reasonable.

Speaker 1  02:18
Now, that's fair. So it will be a continuing improvement process here. But But this week, I have an update from Joel on the ETA for better sections on the income statement. He says, ideally, he'll get this done by the end of the week, very safely by the 15th. And a first draft of core numbers without percentages is already done. So I have an updated path along there. And then for everything else. Can we go through and take a look at everything that's in process for accounts receivable and get an update? on that? Maybe especially from Mark and Drew, will that work for you guys?

Unknown Speaker  03:10
Yeah. Okay.

Speaker 1  03:13
Were you able to see the last version of the reports I sent this morning, the simplified version?

Speaker 2  03:19
I did not see those. I'm not sure. Were those sent as a body in the body the email instead of an attachment? For some reason? I don't think I saw them.

Speaker 1  03:32
No, that's okay. I did send them as attachments. But I'm not sure what happened there. And it's not a big deal. I was able to filter out everything that was already done and that had documentation related to it. And so I have a much shorter list regarding billing process improvement. I'm also open to any feedback if I have these in the wrong buckets, please let me know. So Mark, I had you creating a standard template for miscellaneous sales orders created outside of assist does that have done or were we unprocessed? Oh, that's it. Oh, hang on baby. Payroll. There we go. Perfect.

Speaker 2  04:17
Know that? I'm starting to sound like a broken broken record on that, but that is not done. Yeah. So as to date. Well, no, let's let's leave the date there. I just, yeah, just need to

Unknown Speaker  04:34
just leave it as is.

Speaker 1  04:37
All right. Do we have a process for entering and assist all sales orders? That's the same thing, isn't it? Nevermind. Duplicate. I think well create standard template and implement a process are that is that a duplicate? Or is that actually two separate tasks now that I'm looking at it?

Speaker 2  04:58
The top two links there. They are two separate tasks. I did review the, the implement process with Dwayne yesterday. So I would while it hasn't been implemented, I don't think that I would leave it. status as is but the grading the standard template and starting to use that will will, by default, complete the next one. So okay,

Speaker 1  05:32
that makes sense. We'll put that as a dependency. Okay. Um, the implement daily billing process. We had. You're waiting on Josh for a few things. How is that going?

Speaker 2  05:48
So, Josh, this morning, that is those changes have gone live. Josh, would, everything's done on job site on that.

Speaker 1  06:06
And that's still in progress on your side down then.

Speaker 2  06:09
Yeah, that's it. We have time I want to cover the three emails I send just prior to the meeting. I want to cover progress. Great.

Speaker 1  06:23
mirror reality for Bill Two. I don't remember where we left that. We waiting on Josh for anything.

Speaker 2  06:33
So he Josh did this morning, Josh said he did make all the changes on the hour to vendor those automatic RTO updates. Is there. Matthias is there? Are there other parts to this that like I see financing that still needs to be done?

Matthias Miller  06:54
Yeah, financing would be the main would be the remaining piece. Which this gets interesting from I think it requires a little bit of thought from you guys because it's maybe I'm thinking about later on but as soon as possible that the lender might pay part of it but the balance is due by the customer or it might be vice versa, the customer pays part and the balance is due from the lender.

Speaker 2  07:23
And yeah, I can't remember we talked about this okay, the RTO vendor RTO sales we basically said the initial down payment comes from the customer then at point of delivery the customer changes from John Smith to the rent to own company which mirrors reality for the finance company. I can't remember if we discussed switching customers or not

Speaker 2  08:03
mean just off the top, I'm inclined to say that let's just give it to finance sale, let's just plan that the customer that there's no change to the customer in the finance like if if the finance company's paying the remaining balance, or paying the full price on the building we just they have documentation they have that tells us which they make a payment for which customer it is. And we can track it like that, that we're trying to there are too many variables to try and automate that like we did for RTO but that's still we did do you remember did we discuss that in any detail or or not?

Unknown Speaker  09:02
Don't miss Hall and I'm sure that

Speaker 2  09:05
I mean you couldn't we could make an you could make an argument both ways that the customer should change but it seems like there's so many variables that I was implying to say let's start with we make no changes to the costume or we just know that if we get a payment from there's multiple ways to know that if this building is an AR that the remaining balance is to be collected from the finance man or when we get a payment to say oh we got a payment from the finance company know how to figure out what needs to be recorded because we were dealing with to only to finance companies I don't disagree or pushback if you if you think that's too simplistic. Given the bias

Speaker 3  10:03
what little I remember about that was with the possibility of having the ship to customer being the customer and the bill to being the lumding. unmarked or something. Like I was thinking maybe there was some workaround that had something to do with that.

Speaker 2  10:24
And we are showing both of those fields on the receive payment report, I believe, right? Or is it only one? Maybe not, but at what point do we change?

Unknown Speaker  10:48
At what point should we change? Like on the sales order, should we change that to show the finance company

Matthias Miller  11:01
I have a proposal, the proposal is that once we get a our accounting impact, verify and anything else nailed down that we need to nail down, then we take the time to think through how we want to handle Bill two scenarios for for

Unknown Speaker  11:20
financing.

Matthias Miller  11:22
And until then, I would make an argument that if Dwayne's office is okay handling AR for financing in a little bit of a it's not even really that obscure but not have having the building reflected that's really the biggest people that are going to be impacted by that is them. And so I would make an argument that we should, in the interest of priority, defer that and perhaps Perhaps even write up a change request to come back and reconsider bill to pay for financing at a future date.

Unknown Speaker  12:03
Agree good.

Matthias Miller  12:08
So you can you can consider this one done? I think we'll skip documentation on it as well.

Speaker 1  12:14
Okay, so done and not deferred is what I've been hearing.

Matthias Miller  12:17
Yeah, this this verb will consider done from the RTO. Side.

Speaker 1  12:21
Awesome. Okay. How about then we move on. I had grabbed sales tax billing process as a as an objective from one of Mark's documents. And the only thing I really found related to that I had captured was this item called sales tax that I think was in the work plan. And so I wasn't sure if this really belonged here, or if this is something that's currently being worked on at all at this moment. Any thoughts on sales tax related? Buckets?

Unknown Speaker  13:06
I'm not exactly sure what this

Speaker 1  13:10
now let's see, if I have any background on it.

Unknown Speaker  13:14
Let me um, so basically,

Matthias Miller  13:22
Dwayne had wanted a shot at cleaning up the sales tax, some of the sales tax reconciliation and collection and reporting of wholesale buildings, etc, etc, etc. And I kind of think there's a little bit of a long tail on this. I think this could potentially start with, if I have free time, I think there's, there's two ways to see this. There's a few ways this can go. We can just push it down the timeline further. If for some reason you guys are we find you guys heads down on accounting stuff, and I run out of stuff to do it's, I think it's directly something that I can get my head together with him and we can put together a proposal for it. Find out you know, just find out more when he's thinking but I kind of also think this is a we're not making the problem worse

Unknown Speaker  14:28
than it is. So let's fix fix the problems one at a time.

Speaker 2  14:34
That you're you're suggesting is to defer this until sometime next year.

Unknown Speaker  14:40
Yeah,

Speaker 2  14:42
I would agree. I mean, I think when we do that we also want to look at like we're making some changes on the sales order where we're, we're saying at the point of a customer walks in, we say this is an estimated sales tax, but then when the sale happens, we want to go by I can and ping tax jar again. And then that is why we file because you only file on every sales order. That's a one time event that only happens one time. So I think that could be part of this. But yeah, I think deferring would be good

Matthias Miller  15:21
I think this might just be a matter of excluding this from a report.

Unknown Speaker  15:25
Yeah, I'll move out the due dates and

Matthias Miller  15:29
exclude Okay, that'll work.

Speaker 1  15:33
Okay, the credit and collections management piece. The gaps start counting impacts. Me see

Speaker 2  15:46
on that this morning, Dwayne Josh and I were talking and it appears Josh is going to try and schedule a meeting and get the four of us together because there was some

Speaker 2  16:02
what he was trying to fix was well, bottom line is we seemed like we were missing each other. Josh said I fixed this and here's how it works and Dwayne said I didn't know there was a problem with that in that area but you know from the shed out we need something and not so I think well okay. I think we need to get our heads together on that with Josh and he's planning to schedule a meeting but he did say those stripe payments made within a sales orders are that as far as he knows that is working correctly now.

Matthias Miller  16:50
So I think that means that stripe accounting impact was back in like words just need to account for fees basically.

Speaker 2  17:00
You're seeing on the the the ones being processed directly within us is

Matthias Miller  17:09
Yeah, I mean I think even the ones outside of that are well we need to apply them to the right sales order so but yeah, for the ones with an assist

Speaker 2  17:21
what Josh was the work that Josh did was manually or I think he was he was planning to make so that they can be manually entered whiskey page with he would have all the details all those convoluted more of it. Okay.

Matthias Miller  17:41
Well, yeah, I'm not sure Okay, well we need to meet because I don't understand how what he was doing was not fixing a problem but maybe Dwayne wasn't aware of the problem. So we will I think I can

Matthias Miller  18:01
and maybe take a look at one less one more thing

Unknown Speaker  18:15
I'm

Speaker 2  18:15
curious if we have time if we could take a look at some stripe some reason stripe transactions because I had the impression I had gotten this morning was that those everything should be working Are you saying that you need to account for fees on those yet

Matthias Miller  18:39
we're not Yeah, we're not pushing strike these right now.

Unknown Speaker  18:43
Oh, okay.

Matthias Miller  18:47
And either Josh or I need to do some coding to counter strike these and if Josh did everything he thought he was supposed to do then there was miscommunication between him and me and what he thought he was going to do. Or he simply didn't communicate one more piece that you and I were planning to coordinate on. So got it. We all gotta get on a call and get some clarity okay

Speaker 1  19:21
okay, so this is still in progress. Did I change the due dates or should I leave it as this

Speaker 4  19:29
No well if accounting impact cross your fingers I can still get done today. It's just

Matthias Miller  19:48
there's other issues that may surface based on our conversation with Josh and doing

Speaker 1  19:56
okay, how about the design sales order discrepancy? right off

Speaker 4  20:06
I think well, that is CS Drew, you

Matthias Miller  20:16
can start assigning accounts for write offs.

Speaker 3  20:21
Okay, well, yesterday I went to the I found the place where the write offs are and I wasn't able to do anything, but I think I was

Unknown Speaker  20:36
well, that's helpful. Yeah, the landmarks fee,

Unknown Speaker  20:44
then I click on it. And it's just those

Unknown Speaker  20:50
two things. Right? But

Matthias Miller  20:54
go into these are not really FDA financial obligations anymore. But if you go into

Unknown Speaker  21:00
that page for covenant configurations,

Unknown Speaker  21:04
pretty much so. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  21:08
Right off. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  21:11
Or that's not right. But wherever it's gonna go. Okay.

Speaker 2  21:15
On the on the first page, you would add whatever right else you want to see. Right. Great. And I'm assuming you can select

Speaker 3  21:24
let me know. Again, another one be added. Oh, new right off reason. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  21:30
Got it. Yep.

Unknown Speaker  21:33
Okay, sounds good.

Speaker 2  21:34
It's things become amazingly simple once you know where to go and what to do.

Unknown Speaker  21:42
Exactly. So

Speaker 2  21:45
what I mean, once Drew is done. Right, all should be fully functional and ready to go. I mean, they are. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  21:55
they are functional today. I reworked a whole bunch of stuff with some of the accounting impact stuff. So sales are now I can't remember, either way, I'm going to write offs are not pushing into into accounting yet, I don't believe or sorry. Right now. They're not pushing into into accounting yet. But we'll fix that in our next update.

Speaker 3  22:21
No, the amount of the right off is not coming over. But the the sales invoice would say that it is like the amount of the invoice is coming across.

Unknown Speaker  22:35
Correct? Yeah. Okay.

Matthias Miller  22:39
Like the payments are coming in? Well, yeah, basically, which, basically your AOV is going to be off by your by your

Unknown Speaker  22:46
write off amounts. Okay.

Speaker 2  22:52
But on the individual sales order, it will if you have a landmark fee of $50, if you go and apply the payment and apply the write out that sales order will see the balance was zero. All right.

Unknown Speaker  23:11
Great. Yeah,

Speaker 3  23:13
I would send over that. Is that a zero balance?

Matthias Miller  23:18
The sales order which shows your balance, it would send over that it has a gain. If fees $20. It was written off. It shows Well, or if there was a Yeah, then it would show that $20 AR would be off between two $20. Okay. Good.

Speaker 1  23:44
Okay, great. Well, I'm gonna put this in review. And for the sake of checking in next week, I'm gonna say it's due next week, just so I remember to check in with you drew to see if there's anything that comes up that Okay. Great. Is there anything? Now I've updated my report since I sent it to you guys, which is also bad practice. So I apologize. I think we're ready to go on to payroll. And I think there's not very much there. So we could knock this out and I can let you guys get on with your call. I wanted to see if there was anything else that I needed to track when it came down to payroll software integration. As I understand it, you're staying with QuickBooks, and it's basically closed out but I didn't want to be losing any information there.

Matthias Miller  24:37
Well, we're still going to need better handling for paid vacation and we will need the payroll do report.

Unknown Speaker  24:43
They will do reports

Speaker 1  24:46
Okay, so under the second one payroll module, customer updates, better, better handling for paid vacation, still, their payroll do record is still there and dissipated versus unanticipated payroll items is still there. I'm not sure that it needs to be.

Unknown Speaker  25:07
Yeah, it does.

Matthias Miller  25:10
Yeah, that one can be deferred. And the secondary payment accounts can be what I'm trying to remember if I actually, if I ended up keeping those, those fields

Unknown Speaker  25:26
I mean, it's, I think, cut down.

Matthias Miller  25:36
So presumably, we should take out the payroll savings fields just so that we don't, and we can bring them back later. But there's no reason to keep that information duplicated between two systems.

Matthias Miller  25:50
Is that,

Speaker 3  25:51
right? Because we're not even doing we're not doing the ACH here at all. So doesn't need to be there.

Matthias Miller  26:03
Mark any objection against it?

Speaker 2  26:07
No, I mean, we're basically, the plan is to export the gross pay information from assists. Process and payout the payroll in QuickBooks, create a general ledger, create an import where the transactions resulting from each pay period and import that back into assists, so. Yeah, that makes sense.

Unknown Speaker  26:40
Okay, so I can close this set what I'm hearing.

Unknown Speaker  26:45
Yes, there are

Speaker 2  26:48
there are those two minor updates that are those listed here. But as we defer those

Unknown Speaker  26:58
No, they're not.

Unknown Speaker  27:02
It was what was it was showing work orders.

Matthias Miller  27:11
And email or audio? You wouldn't have that there was an email that Mark sent last week with some payroll module changes. Yeah.

Speaker 2  27:20
So let me know if you don't if you can't find that, those who are rather minor, and then Matthias question on better handling of paid vacation, what is that?

Matthias Miller  27:32
Basically, we want to make sure that we give a warning on the timecard if somebody tries to take more vacation than they have. Okay. Which seems to me like one of those things that yes, we really should do this. I don't know. It's doesn't seem like the world is going to come to a stop if we don't.

Speaker 1  27:53
Yeah. Got it. Good. Okay. Well, I think I will let you guys go. Please feel free to give me any input on what you'd like to see. In terms of recording. I'm happy to try to do the best I can there. And next week, I think I'll be better prepared. We can look at this by due date, if that's more effective for you, or we could continue to look at it by subproject. So I'm open to feedback. But I think this is great. It's very helpful to me. So thank you. Anything else for you?

Speaker 2  28:33
I mean, I think keeping a group per project like you have it is great. I think the at least for myself, the just the accountability it brings is great. Because I really don't want you asking about the same thing again, giving you the same response next week, saying no, I still don't have that done. So yeah. positive momentum for, at least for me. Okay, great.

Speaker 1  29:07
Mark, were you able to see the timeline that I sent you as well, on the sub projects? shows just a little bit of a visualization of what's happening month by month?

Speaker 2  29:16
Oh, the the was it on the first page of the like the bar graph?

Unknown Speaker  29:20
Yeah, it's like a bar graph basically.

Unknown Speaker  29:23
Or yeah, I was Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  29:25
Do you like that visualization?

Unknown Speaker  29:33
Sorry, it's loud here.

Speaker 2  29:36
So if I'm okay, if I'm seeing that correctly, the shows on the calendar I'm just looking at say like cash management, the blue bar, so am I. So, that's saying that that should be done by the end of December. All right, with how that

Speaker 1  30:02
without that's currently set up, probably. So yeah, I think I've may have changed that sense, actually. But yes, the goal, as I add more information to this, the goal would be to make that more accurate. So we could actually take a look and a bit more visual sense of where you're at with some of these, these goals visa, these smaller units of work, right. So maybe that helps with priorities. And just a very quick visualization of what's in progress, what's done, what's not. So I hope to add more accurate dates to find that helpful.

Speaker 2  30:38
So the left side of the bar is when technically when we started the project, right?

Speaker 1  30:43
Yeah, but I've pretty much put everything on October 1, because that's when I really started entering things into my system. So I can adjust that if you'd like more accurate metrics.

Speaker 2  30:52
No, that's fine. And then is obviously the day to day stay. Exactly. Is there a way to see that I can see the progress on each of these projects, as far as like, does the bar fill up?

Unknown Speaker  31:07
Oh, the darker color or what?

Unknown Speaker  31:11
To give you a sense of percent completed?

Speaker 2  31:14
Yeah. Or is it not? It's fine. Either way, if that's not showing that that's perfectly

Speaker 1  31:18
well, it won't on this report, but I could definitely take a look at to see if I can get that for you in some way. Okay, um, so let me see what I can do.

Speaker 2  31:31
Okay. And then one other question. I was kind of beginning you said you talked to Joel or you had an you have an update from Joe what was the timeline on that again on those

Speaker 1  31:48
Hi, so that was on the better sections on income statement. Well, what he told me to pass on so I have lacked a little context but he thought that the ETA for that was going to be the end of this week or very safely by the 15th of the month and I think that was someone was waiting on that perhaps is a dependency oh that makes sense to you. Or do you need more context?

Unknown Speaker  32:13
No, no, that makes sense okay.

Speaker 2  32:22
And what can you He also said that what has been completed already certain parts

Speaker 1  32:28
a first draft of core numbers without percentages

Matthias Miller  32:37
I can find out exactly where that is because the main income statement isn't there

Matthias Miller  33:07
I'm seeing this grouping on the balance sheet but not the

Unknown Speaker  33:22
Oh, some of this?

Matthias Miller  33:52
Oh, I think what he means done, basically it means that he's done the work. I don't know that the personal version is

Unknown Speaker  34:01
accessible. Okay. But we can still reasonably expect an update and to see these changes this weekend. Or after this weekend, and if not more, like, two weeks than two weeks.

Speaker 1  34:24
Yeah, that would be my interpretation of his dates. Does that sound right and nice. Yep. Sounds great. Okay, okay. All right. Great. Thank you so much, guys.

Speaker 3  34:34
I will have one objection to this timeline. And it makes it look like we don't have much time left.

Speaker 1  34:50
Well, I can give it to you by week. If that makes sense. You might have to get some legal size paper for your printer Oh, no,

Speaker 3  35:03
that's great. Okay. Would it be asking too much to get an email of these? Like, maybe Monday mornings, or Yeah, that would work right afternoons or like at some point and we can. It helps for just reference to make sure that I'm covering what everybody thinks I'm covering and missing. Yes.

Unknown Speaker  35:25
Yeah, absolutely. Thanks. Yep.

Unknown Speaker  35:33
Was there anything else I can do for you?

Unknown Speaker  35:37
No, I think that's it. Thank you.

Speaker 1  35:40
I'm gonna jump off have a great meeting. Thanks. All right. Bye.

Unknown Speaker  35:48
Right.

Matthias Miller  35:53
So two things we could potentially dive into. I don't know that there's more well, maybe start with researching these? Well, sorry, don't you guys said I'm really here. We can research these sales orders the invoicing and figuring out what's happening, which will lead to those and then we could also take a look at the reconciliation and see if there are other vendor invoices that are missing for NBC, or other issues with reconciliation. If we're ready to take a look at either one.

Speaker 2  36:37
Well, why don't we look at the details on the invoicing? First, I think that's one of the next things we need to get. We'll start moving from rubber stamping to taking it live. So.

Speaker 2  36:58
If you're looking at the Ohio one first, this one, we took a look at this one with Dwayne, I believe. Okay, several questions. This one is showing an AR some of them are showing our summer ends. I'm assuming that just as we transition, that's probably why eventually they'll all start showing ours here. Right.

Matthias Miller  37:23
Well, these are all either ours were

Unknown Speaker  37:27
SDI.

Speaker 2  37:28
Well, some of the later ones, some of the other ones like yeah, like there you see some an up?

Matthias Miller  37:35
Did you want me to go back? And that's basically just as we transition? I

Speaker 2  37:42
know, there's as that's what I expect it just wanted to verify. So no, don't do any work on cleaning up. So but yeah, there's if we go back to the Ohio building.

Speaker 2  37:59
I looked at I think I looked at this with Dwayne. And he said, Oh, this one was maybe he did make some changes on this than when we were talking. Okay, there you rubber stamped at four in the morning.

Matthias Miller  38:17
And then the next. Wait, the next day we took it back off. Okay,

Speaker 2  38:26
why did we take it? Okay, the reason I flagged it in the first place was I said, Well, there's no delivery date here. And the proposed invoice date is way back on 1019.

Speaker 2  38:43
So I don't know where they're transitioning. I think this may have been a build on site building, but I'm not Oh, I think what Dwayne and I

Unknown Speaker  38:58
included

Speaker 2  39:04
Okay, I think here's the story. So this was delivered on 1030 but the hall obviously had not marked it completed because it doesn't have the delivery date here but the reason it it the reason it appeared on this report, we believe is the final payment was recorded and the AR report that Dwayne and the district manager using look like the payments were all collected and so they marked it they have a step of marking a building complete which put it on here is if you have a sales order modification history that show you anything on

Matthias Miller  39:52
nothing happened to the sales order between these two timeframes. So something

Speaker 2  39:58
happened yeah. 30 That on 1030 There was a payment date payment was applied so nothing

Matthias Miller  40:09
the sales orders that completed it had to do with the building. So I mean one of the weird things is okay so let's take a look at the billing So on Monday something would have happened

Unknown Speaker  40:29
Monday the building was free was created

Unknown Speaker  40:42
and the transit task

Matthias Miller  40:46
which this is it no one knew they had a transit task.

Speaker 2  40:50
Okay, see the Laverne Shetler the hauler did not marked as completed until 11 one but that it showed up on 11 One he said yes I completed this on tech complete at this 1030

Unknown Speaker  41:12
Why but something happened on Monday

Speaker 4  41:21
that made us think that we should invoice the building on Monday.

Unknown Speaker  41:26
Yeah, it can you

Matthias Miller  41:31
sorry, the invoice the sales order. Okay, so

Unknown Speaker  41:35
Tuesday we invoiced it so something happened on Monday what happened on the building what happened on Monday was

Speaker 4  41:52
there was a revision no that was on the stage that's two weeks ago nothing happened on the building so the only thing that happened

Speaker 4  42:07
to transit task on Monday Well there's one No that's that's the wrong Monday.

Speaker 2  42:14
I think Can you can you go back to the sales order activity history I think there's a section there

Unknown Speaker  42:21
the third sorry there we go.

Unknown Speaker  42:24
Yeah this Monday the system update did this have something to do with it like the payment date

Matthias Miller  42:35
we do we do nothing with we do nothing with payments been payments has nothing to do with invoicing gets cancelled or quote or the building was cancelled

Unknown Speaker  42:53
and then if billing is district X transit SL IDs

Unknown Speaker  43:06
Okay, let's go back to this content here's the building the transit tasks

Unknown Speaker  43:19
linked sales order

Unknown Speaker  43:37
let's go back

Unknown Speaker  43:55
here's the other thing that

Unknown Speaker  44:16
I'm so confused

Unknown Speaker  44:30
this series actually this one isn't showing any transit tasks 231

Unknown Speaker  44:37
Was this a build on site billing or not? No, no, obviously not have learned

Matthias Miller  44:47
how to go find the transit task again.

Matthias Miller  45:01
I think oh, what is the go ahead but I think it's an issue that we had when we took the new sales order IDs live but let me see if I can prove that

Speaker 2  45:16
but I was going to point out was on that there's a completion date that was stamped 1030 that some some

Unknown Speaker  45:36
understand why this one isn't

Speaker 2  45:44
okay, see that completion date status completion date 1030 1143 What caused that to

Unknown Speaker  45:55
you he somehow

Matthias Miller  46:01
put an insulation completed at 1130 Maybe I don't know.

Speaker 2  46:08
But there Wayne's office is also marking sales orders complete on the procedural accounts receivable report I think it might be worth taking a quick look at it's what they call a currently called a procedural AR report

Matthias Miller  46:30
give me one moment here let me let me.

Matthias Miller  47:24
It has to do with the prefix here

Unknown Speaker  47:35
this gets awful?

Unknown Speaker  49:10
The bottom line is that the

Matthias Miller  49:18
we're look we're doing an exact match or we're matching on the prefix. So, because

Unknown Speaker  49:29
somewhere

Matthias Miller  49:33
so, this one still is a sales order because it's not being hasn't been invoiced. But the transit task has the end prefix on the sales order ID. And so it's not recognizing I suspected something along the lines of not recognizing that. I mean, it's not seeing the linking between these two Let

Matthias Miller  50:05
me see if I can confirm that history from sob sob had been an all along

Unknown Speaker  50:18
this one on Monday, the

Matthias Miller  50:25
sales order indeed the sales order got modified. The idea changed from end to our we weren't able to find the associated train the task, we assumed it was a building that did not have a transit task attached. Therefore, we invoiced the after build.

Speaker 2  50:41
And the reason it got changed from end our Monday was because a modification was made to the sales or ie the payment was applied. So is this. I mean, obviously, this needs to be okay, is this something that any new orders created from this point forward? Would not be affected by this? Or is this we need to change? Are we saying we need to change the logic aerobar don't just look at numbers and ignore prefixes.

Speaker 4  51:18
Yeah, it's something like that it's or it's

Matthias Miller  51:27
standardize the prefix for q, r and n to something like x or whatever. But keep the prefix for district X or me sorry for STI.

Speaker 2  51:46
Now, what do you mean by keep the standardized prefix Are you saying he has an x all the way through or that just under the hood things

Matthias Miller  51:57
under the hood? And basically under the hood? You still have to differentiate between STI versus district X, you can't cross cross those across those numbers.

Speaker 2  52:09
But what's visible on the reports would be would be the still be the end the are the is so what's the solution on on this just you need to figure out what's the solution?

Matthias Miller  52:32
The solution is you need to take a look at every place where we were handling this which is pretty easy to find and I need to

Matthias Miller  52:52
take a look at what we're doing and handle it appropriately.

Speaker 2  52:56
All right. Perfect. So that takes care of that one. Good. Why don't we look at well okay, the NC one we don't even need to look at that one because that one is well yeah, let's take a quick look at the NC one the if you're done it we're done here anyway with the first one and

Matthias Miller  53:23
thinking I wonder would actually be be good to temporarily revert the our prefix until we can think through the whole the implications here

Unknown Speaker  53:37
afraid it's

Matthias Miller  53:49
and then push an update tonight and then that'll give me a little bit more time to figure out exactly what's going on.

Unknown Speaker  53:55
Say you are playing a pushing update tonight.

Matthias Miller  53:58
Well, I think I would see that if I could. Okay

Speaker 2  54:06
let's look at the one on the NC report. We're

Speaker 2  54:19
Yeah, are the last one there? I'm pretty sure that one is. Is there because there's no transit task? Which is or can be correct because there's no because this is a wholesale deal.

Matthias Miller  54:39
Okay, no, it's the same thing and verses are

Speaker 2  54:43
all this Okay. Got it. Okay, and then all of the ones for Ohio 11. One are those Okay, the first one is an N. I'm curious what that one is. We're seeing upgrade customer 3940 11 one that seems kind of strange like

Unknown Speaker  55:17
has a storage shed

Speaker 4  55:25
every customer has a building does not have a it was sent

Matthias Miller  55:37
it's linked to a lot building with no customer delivery.

Speaker 2  55:43
Okay, and this is, but is it marked complete? Okay, how is it? Okay, these are

Unknown Speaker  55:53
we talked about

Unknown Speaker  55:57
okay, the story on these in New York is the hauler there it is not

Speaker 2  56:07
the sub shop there because it's just taking care of their own deliveries. And then after the fact they're saying, hey, just to let you know, we we did deliver this building. But I thought we'd talk with we talked about always putting a transit cast to these buildings. So they don't mark. Ah, okay. So this building was built but not not delivered, right? We just said there's no transit test. Okay, so had we followed that the business process of putting transit tests, attaching a transit test each one of these that would have soccer?

Matthias Miller  57:03
And then all the other other ones are you're really the

Unknown Speaker  57:10
are those also the same story are to end?

Matthias Miller  57:12
Well, I know for sure that the RT N is causing a problem? Is it the only problem? I don't know. But it's not really possible until until we get the card and

Speaker 2  57:30
that second the last one that was a test doing and that was that invoice Dwayne and I were testing or the sales or the miscellaneous sales or so.

Unknown Speaker  57:45
Good, well, I don't.

Speaker 2  57:49
Okay, we need to get this, this art and thing. I'd say let me know when that's done. And then we'll, we'll look at taking this live? Probably sooner, yeah. Sooner rather than later. One thing that just

Unknown Speaker  58:09
okay. Let's,

Speaker 2  58:10
first of all, you're seeing there is a possibility this could go live tonight. Either way, you'll will update me on status when this goes by. Right? Correct. That the other thing that I think we're going to need is all of this rubber stamping, I believe has, this was the right thing to do, but I'm pretty sure that it's moved a bunch it's invoiced a bunch of sales orders that should not have been invoiced. And so the moment we go live, we'll need to here's what I think we should do is once we go live, have you created a report that shows what was rubber stamp as invoice every day? Not sure what details we don't need to pull in and then go back through and say, oh, you know, these 10 should not have been invoiced. You know, take off the invoice, date, invoice date or whatever make so that they go back into finished goods inventory. Move them out of AR does that sound sound right to you? Or make sense? Yeah. Okay, because we're kind of doing a dance of trying to get it close enough to where we're ready to go live so that it stops rubber stamping, but we also don't want to rush it on that site so

Unknown Speaker  59:36
good one other quick. This is really minor, but how hard would it be to say

Speaker 2  59:45
using Joel's accounting tools book as far as the guy, instead of invoicing we really should say no, nevermind, I was gonna say we should say to billing but we've got way more Nothing to do so let's disregard that so good that's all I had on on that so let's go through some of the stuff you mentioned this morning like think it was multi sales process cake printing maybe had other stuff that

Matthias Miller  1:00:27
we scratch at first make some notes

Unknown Speaker  1:01:12
this maybe we do

Unknown Speaker  1:01:43
do we know

Unknown Speaker  1:02:13
so I guess one one thought would be on the payment type

Matthias Miller  1:02:22
basically having a mutually exclusive checkbox

Unknown Speaker  1:02:27
for

Matthias Miller  1:02:30
uses checks uses Ach so that we know so when we when we generate a report is saying show me all the checks to printout that we've we know which payment types or checks

Unknown Speaker  1:03:00
were I mean

Unknown Speaker  1:03:05
some method of sorting any method of sorting

Speaker 3  1:03:16
you know I've ever be thing of have a column that says what payment type it is and then you could sort the column that would put them in order to do so. But be very

Unknown Speaker  1:03:29
sure do you

Matthias Miller  1:03:35
or let you filter down by a multi select List of payment types

Unknown Speaker  1:03:42
yeah

Unknown Speaker  1:03:52
okay well that would definitely be easy way to learn one of those

Unknown Speaker  1:04:10
and then

Matthias Miller  1:04:17
so I'm planning to create check records that tie out to vendor invoices with the total storing the total payout to the to the bank account

Unknown Speaker  1:04:31
and

Matthias Miller  1:04:47
we're gonna have to make sure we handle the workflow flow appropriately for assigning check numbers

Matthias Miller  1:04:57
should be tied out to the company to the Add to the lead to the to asset GL account or the acid to the asset finance account

Matthias Miller  1:05:20
the main thing would be knowing that we know that we can retro actively stomp at the correct check numbers for

Unknown Speaker  1:05:28
that however that works.

Speaker 3  1:05:31
Good you did you have a space where I'll show what your beginning check number will be for your string of checks that you're going to print? You know tied back to that GL account, which would remember what the last check was. That's where it was started. But you'd have to be able to edit it

Unknown Speaker  1:05:51
you know? Yeah, reason

Matthias Miller  1:05:55
I think so. And I think the other thing that we're going to do is the system will think in terms of batches, so when you

Unknown Speaker  1:06:10
go to print will probably what is the best way to do this

Matthias Miller  1:06:30
when you go to print, we would have a check range. So we would you would go generate the checks and then go to print and we would default to the last starting check number that you just specified

Unknown Speaker  1:06:45
so

Speaker 2  1:07:01
probably worth noting that we also like currently doing that in QuickBooks, but then we're also each location has a a physical checkbook where they write out checks handwrite out checks and then report after the fact that hey, I wrote out a check using this number and currently though, like the sequence on those is completely different. Those are a four digit number and the thing clear the others are a five digit number. So

Unknown Speaker  1:07:43
walk through that would follow up and work on that probably does that have any design implications or not?

Matthias Miller  1:07:52
Do you create vendor invoices for those checks? Yes,

Speaker 2  1:08:00
everything I don't know is it worth looking at a few of those or not? We just processed those as prepaid. Same as in as a credit card because we're seeing well it's happened already we just need to now record it in accounting

Unknown Speaker  1:08:26
you were looking at some of this

Unknown Speaker  1:08:27
morning. I don't know Is it what are now I don't want to derail what from what you're doing now but it might be worth taking.

Matthias Miller  1:08:41
A very simple way to deal with this whether it's the right one or not would be to I don't really like proliferating payment types but have a.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:15
If

Matthias Miller  1:09:23
one option would be to let you manually create check records for these and fill in the details. And if we always start with the highest will either you never go through the print process for these so therefore, the print numbering never gets affected. Or we just always go based on the highest check number and we'll use the five digit one

Unknown Speaker  1:09:59
and either one It was good work.

Speaker 2  1:10:01
And what do you mean you would always use? Are you saying for printing you would always use the highest number plus one?

Unknown Speaker  1:10:07
Yeah

Speaker 2  1:10:10
yeah, I may I think the About the only thing what typically happens is we create a vendor invoice depending on rarely do we create a purchase order unless it's an inventory item that we need to push into inventory. So if it's Oh, it's subcontractor does some work one day and he wants to be paid that evening bill right out a check, give him the check turned around and sent any information through the accounts payable, seeing what it was for. And then if there if no invoice was created, Dwayne's office will just mock up an invoice with the correct GL account and record this was paid with a check check and just enter the check number that was used

Speaker 2  1:11:12
but why don't we just take a quick look at one of them and I mean I don't think that any change there but if we go to you go to vendor invoices for affordable barn company vendor was looking at Milo Miller Bender yeah just

Unknown Speaker  1:11:36
yeah

Unknown Speaker  1:11:40
am I paid I think status

Unknown Speaker  1:11:51
Yeah, so on that one

Speaker 2  1:11:58
we're saying payment type was primary checking ABC payment type or payment ID is 4021 and I mean that that process works I don't know that

Speaker 2  1:12:17
I think that can just continue this like it is for those types of prepaid but I yeah, just bringing it up in case there's something that we need to

Unknown Speaker  1:12:32
we just know this

Matthias Miller  1:12:42
okay, and they still have that report that we talked about creating based on the mostly based on the AP report. Think cross your fingers. This is good enough for you to do it first first round, and we can take a look at it. Great.

Speaker 2  1:13:09
All that report that would basically be here's everything that's ready to be paid. Now go pay which should and that report should only look at any invoices with a status of unpaid only when they get to that status. Are we ready to pay?

Unknown Speaker  1:13:32
Yeah, I'm pretty verified.

Speaker 3  1:13:37
Oh, one quick question here on these things. If you make the ACH payment or you put in for all those payments to be done, does that like if you go to create an ACH payment does that change the status because I was I was trying to run somewhere maybe it's just Josh question but the ACH failed so I'm not sure I'm not sure what was going on

Matthias Miller  1:14:24
I don't know that the judge question

Unknown Speaker  1:14:27
was fine.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:44
Good. Anything else?

Unknown Speaker  1:14:51
The multi sales process. You're working on that there's what was That that was recording payment recording a single payment for.

Speaker 2  1:15:05
Yeah. So how should we I know recently one of the companies had a large couple $100,000 payment for a whole bunch of shifts, which is kind of just not typical. But basically what you're working on is how to handle that.

Matthias Miller  1:15:24
Yep. It'll be a workflow that basically creates lets you create payment rows on sales orders that get tied back to a single, multi sales order payment record.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:40
And then

Matthias Miller  1:15:45
yeah, so you'll have a slightly different workflow, when you're, you'll still see it on the sales order, you won't be able to modify it through the sales order. So see it there?

Speaker 2  1:15:59
We have, we have that pretty pretty commonly on wholesale, with his direct as well on some of theirs. It's like, here's $50,000 for these 10 buildings, and then good.

Unknown Speaker  1:16:19
Anything,

Speaker 3  1:16:21
did you have any further comments on the reconciliation issue thing from this morning? It was sent the emails should be ready. That's pretty much it or?

Matthias Miller  1:16:27
Well, I mean, if you have more specific ones that aren't showing up, or more specific, any any specific issues that you have with reconciliation, I'm happy to take a look at.

Speaker 3  1:16:39
Okay, well, I did take a few numbers over to QuickBooks. And yeah, there was definitely one where it was just simply duplicated, I mean, not duplicated, but there were two invoices to the same vendor in the same check so it didn't match. And then there I could see the two different invoices. And I found both of those on the reconciliation page. So and they have that payment ID in the invoice as field in the invoice. So once that payment ID is showing up on the reconciliation page then we'll be able to see that we'll see the payment ID on the statement and we can search for that payment ID and then we'll see that those two line items or three or however many are tied together all have that payment ID and then if you want to double check you can add the totals add the amounts together and come up with the total but not allowed to work now while we're making checks in another place.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:40
Are you

Matthias Miller  1:17:43
working with Josh on the payment SDK? Yeah, yeah

Speaker 3  1:17:51
so I think that between you know getting the rest of those over there and getting that payment ID I think we'll be able to see a much fuller picture of reconciled transactions

Unknown Speaker  1:18:06
bit by bit yeah good

Speaker 2  1:18:11
probably mean nothing swiftly I'd say just cancel the three o'clock call boundary group Friday at three in that

Matthias Miller  1:18:23
time I am going to be out on Friday

Unknown Speaker  1:18:31
so

Matthias Miller  1:18:36
it was so if there is a time to if you would like to touch base tomorrow at all some

Unknown Speaker  1:18:42
time I'd be open to that depending on where my skin

Unknown Speaker  1:18:58
I would say we could just plan to email we have stopped but then I mean I think we should be fine until Monday

Matthias Miller  1:19:12
feels me I don't mind if you Yeah, I don't particularly mind if you call I'm just not sure how much I might have some availability from

Speaker 4  1:19:25
from three to three to five on Friday but it's it's good going to be a little iffy

Matthias Miller  1:19:38
and then the following Friday

Unknown Speaker  1:19:44
could we bump that when? Little bit later?

Unknown Speaker  1:19:53
Like 330 before?

Unknown Speaker  1:19:58
Yeah, I think 330 should be I'm

Speaker 2  1:20:02
so on the CANS go to 330. So

Unknown Speaker  1:20:07
yep, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:20:08
that should work.

Speaker 4  1:20:11
All right. Sounds good. Yes. Good.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:19
Thank you.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:20
Good. Awesome. Appreciate it. Thank you. You're welcome.
