There are a few takeaways from this console yesterday. One is the per case that He's given us. One thing is what are the epiphany moments, I think what the system was one of them. And then the second major one was more recently following the conversation with Ricky regarding the depth of how systems have impacted me and I think the other one is case. So those were those two thoughts. I think also just coming to embrace, process consulting as a core competency that underlies much of what I do. There's also an intersection with product development and organization development that gets included in that as well.
