Hey Joe, I am running into issues with zfp accounting. When we take a look at the ABC primary checking in the latest open period, the accounting balance is off by about a million dollars, I was able to find some of the discrepancies through items that were voided. that had previously been reconciled because automation concluded that these transactions were no longer relevant or needed or it could not be created. I haven't had a chance to dig into those transactions specifically. But I don't believe that's likely to account for all of the million dollar difference. I didn't know if you had any ideas the client is trying to get this squared away this week to get their financial reports
