All right, so I wanted to take a few notes about my disagreement in some of the gaps in the within the self help industry, number one, only for those who are your going to disagree if you don't believe in a higher power, but I believe that the well actually that's

Speaker 1  00:34
the biggest problem that I have is that parts of the self help industry make the mind the Supreme Being and entity and I think that's misguided. And I don't think even if you're non religious, I don't think that's actually helpful.

Speaker 1  00:54
I believe that instinct is far more important than intellect. And I believe that elevating intellect ends up. Goodness, I don't actually believe that it's one or the other. I believe it's an it's has to be integrated. I do believe there are parts of this self help industry that that elevate intellect beyond to unhealthy proportions, I do absolutely believe. And I also believe that most much of self help is it creates a sort of misguided identity that

Speaker 1  01:50
that is geared off of something that we desire, that's actually an externalized identity. And it means that we are putting control in other people's sequencing. So internal versus external identity, anything that needs to be clarified. So

Speaker 1  02:17
I do think if you are a believer, and you don't understand the power of God, and you've never seen the power of God, but then you're going to be gonna be shocked.
