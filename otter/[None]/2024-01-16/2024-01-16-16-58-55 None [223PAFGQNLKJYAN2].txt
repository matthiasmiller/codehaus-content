Hey Cody. So if you take a look at this thing that I'm sending over, if we take a look at the top $1 For every dollar the marketing dollar we spend, we generate $42 based on the 2.4% ratio. So we're spending for every $2 we spend, we get $84 back in revenue, if we have to double the cost per lead to if we have to double our marketing ad spend in order to get 50% more leads, which seems quite doable, so that we have enough leads for Eric then that gives us $126 of revenue generated for every $4 of marketing spent, which takes us to 3.2%. So I think I think I wanted to share this with you so you get a little bit of a visual of what I'm thinking about in terms of marketing adspend lead flow, can we do it, can we not? And what we're looking at So bottom line, I don't see any reason why we can't do that. And where you can't scale up to that it does mean doubling ad spend probably. But it would keep us well within our three point well in the ballpark of 3%
