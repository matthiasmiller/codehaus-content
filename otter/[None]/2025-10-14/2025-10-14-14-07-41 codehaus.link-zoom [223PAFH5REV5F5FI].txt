Unknown Speaker  01:41
You may All right, welcome back. Yeah. I'm

Matthias Miller  01:44
just trying to do my part. Make sure you guys don't miss Bangladesh too much.

Unknown Speaker  01:52
It's a grainy video on your end. Or what?

Matthias Miller  01:55
No with the joke, what are you saying? Oh, the gym. Jump on my gym. Jig jigs your way through the office to jump on your gym.

Unknown Speaker  02:06
Man, sounds about right.

Matthias Miller  02:11
Okay, all right. Nick It's coming.

Unknown Speaker  02:17
It looks like i

Matthias Miller  02:25
Hey, Nick, hey. All right, so I just want to, I just want to idiot check doing. Mark wants this to be we have it here. Let me. Let me just show you what we have

Matthias Miller  02:48
at least stuff you didn't immediately interject with fail,

Speaker 1  02:55
I'm too busy for Johnson Wilson, that's

Matthias Miller  03:02
Larry. Hilarious. I'm

Unknown Speaker  03:04
not that multitasking,

Matthias Miller  03:07
all right. So basically, we have a report that runs if we can get it to run. And just for comparison, so this is what it looks like now, as opposed to

Unknown Speaker  03:35
this.

Speaker 1  03:41
There you guys, you're this, it was dramatic, but it took a solid 10 seconds after you said it, for the report to show well, it was still building.

Matthias Miller  03:52
There's that. I mean, I just don't, I think fundamentally, first of all, this report, the income statement, is so it is client customized, but it's so horrifically complicated. I mean, do

Speaker 1  04:15
we have a standard income statement that's like, not customized, that's reasonable or not. I'm just curious where we're at with that.

Matthias Miller  04:23
Let's go find out. I mean, even the standard income statement, I think is pretty How bad is it? Look? Repeat list. Merrick, pipeless, 123, wait a minute. Revenue, oh, revenue and expense. But, I mean, but it's still not sales revenue. Formatting is different, and formatting was a bit of a big deal to them, right?

Unknown Speaker  05:15
How much branching we're doing, like we're branching a branch, which is probably fine, I don't know.

Matthias Miller  05:24
Well, we are doing a ton of branching, but if we want to,

Unknown Speaker  05:36
like to get

Matthias Miller  05:40
the basic issue is that if you really want to get a row like this with lines, every row has To be a repeat list item.

Unknown Speaker  06:01
If you're wanting the special totals, is that what you're saying

Matthias Miller  06:08
special totals and special formatting? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  06:12
I don't like no liking

Matthias Miller  06:21
Mark's direct response was, we go see

Unknown Speaker  06:27
something about it would be nice to have this formatting.

Matthias Miller  06:31
Yeah, he, when he was asking, we wish to, you know, yes, if we can match the formatting of existing that would be good.

Matthias Miller  06:50
Um, I don't think it's terrible. I think, if you I mean, a substantial part of the complexity here is all of this crazy stuff.

Unknown Speaker  07:02
Um,

Matthias Miller  07:02
well, that's not completely true, because it

Speaker 1  07:17
looks like we're splitting apart cost of goods and logistics cost of goods,

Matthias Miller  07:23
yeah, cost of goods is it's not uncommon for cost of goods to be

Unknown Speaker  07:28
interesting, yeah, broke it apart like That. That makes sense, I guess.

Matthias Miller  07:36
Now the alternative is,

Matthias Miller  07:45
just saying, screw it. This thing's complicated. Who cares?

Matthias Miller  08:05
You could conceivably the biggest issue is, but again, for totaling purposes you want to feed the values the whole it cogs rose, gross income, gross profit bloke display, Rose total.

Matthias Miller  08:37
So you got to break it out into the channels. Then if you do that,

Unknown Speaker  08:49
so incredibly hard, cut it.

Matthias Miller  08:52
Oh, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  08:56
is there no way we can

Unknown Speaker  08:58
build it?

Speaker 1  09:11
Okay, can we not have a grouping field like on a financial account? What grouping Am I or maybe it's a parent account. I don't know what income statement grouping

Matthias Miller  09:29
you mean, just to use report groups.

Unknown Speaker  09:33
Was it the formatting that was the problem?

Matthias Miller  09:35
I think it is primarily the formatting that's the issue.

Unknown Speaker  09:39
Right, right, right, right,

Matthias Miller  09:43
because it's not just

Speaker 1  09:47
reports like this just are way too much job security.

Matthias Miller  09:52
Well, you know, all right, let's say for fun. I. We had an atomic bomb, and we could throw it in the middle, a barrel jet fuel in an atomic bomb and a set of firecrackers. And we lit a match and watched it all burned down. And we said, Okay, what is the simplest way that we could build. See, we have a percentage and a budget. Okay, here's what, here's what it conceptually is.

Matthias Miller  10:44
It could be a repeat for list. We could take this report, make it be a repeat for list, for these columns,

Matthias Miller  10:59
and basically allow them, allow to repeat, to show an arbitrary amount of numbers. And so if your view is a comparison view, and it's it's actual numbers and comparison period. If review is revenue channel, then the categories are retail, wholesale in total, and we would then sum. So we would need to change some, some of these to list substitute, no, yeah. And then you use the repeating Column list, boom.

Speaker 1  11:42
And then, so you're thinking, you're refactoring the C standard report, so we have to duplicate formatting. Yes, huh.

Matthias Miller  11:51
And it ends up being a little complicated, but basically what you're saying is the C standard report can show up to can show an arbitrary set of quantity of numbers

Matthias Miller  12:10
and all that you're doing. Well, all, quote, quote,

Unknown Speaker  12:22
this macro is just

Matthias Miller  12:26
replace

Unknown Speaker  12:29
this report makes it slightly corner

Matthias Miller  12:33
delimiter.

Matthias Miller  12:47
Okay, so the other thing we could say, if, if we really didn't care, display rows, total display rows, total display rows, for subtypes, look display, look, display row,

Matthias Miller  13:14
second period.

Unknown Speaker  13:17
This is the is the second period? Comparison stuff,

Unknown Speaker  13:20
yes,

Matthias Miller  13:25
so how do we pass in the comparison? So, theoretically,

Matthias Miller  13:34
wait, where's there? Just, where did I lose my look? Display row?

Matthias Miller  13:47
See this is just like we're embedding the secondary row inside the primary row,

Matthias Miller  14:01
which is confusing. It's everything which you want is a

Matthias Miller  14:33
we have the main row. This is the this type, the type, the row text formatting set in value, and what is in the second period, it's the total. List. Why is that? 12345670,

Matthias Miller  15:12
that's the number. Okay, so if we would just change values to be a pipe delimited, or is change values to be a string table with a key and a value, that would be step one, and at that point, then you can have an arbitrary number of values that you embed in

Speaker 2  15:39
here. So what?

Unknown Speaker  15:49
What is the embedding that's going on?

Matthias Miller  15:53
Sorry, it's not the it's not, I misread it. Each display row has each display row has a primary and a secondary

Speaker 2  16:09
number. So

Matthias Miller  16:32
so all I'm really saying

Matthias Miller  16:40
is, if we could

Matthias Miller  16:46
change it from a hard coded current versus second to a string table, whatever you want to call it, who cares

Speaker 1  17:01
where you do your lookups, redo your lookups,

Matthias Miller  17:09
so you centralize complexity, but you don't fully eliminate it. Yeah,

Speaker 1  17:21
I mean, that's going to increase complexity on this report some, but it means that if we have a bug in layout, or if we they want to change layout, we change it in one place. We're not changing it twice. Yeah, that is the that is the advantage, which I think is the right thing to do.

Matthias Miller  17:37
Well, I wonder if we really got into this, if there would be how much capacity, or how much opportunity there would

Unknown Speaker  17:46
be for the better place, yeah, like even a fan of, big fan of doing as much as that as we Can, where reasonable?

Matthias Miller  18:00
Well, this would be a fairly reasonable Can you serialize structures or?

Speaker 1  18:09
No, don't know. They're not. You can't do local structures and stuff yet. I don't think

Matthias Miller  18:20
so. I wonder if,

Matthias Miller  18:29
okay, so we are doing this off of I

Matthias Miller  18:39
wonder if it would be worth writing. I mean, even if you had to write a to string from from string by hand, or

Speaker 1  18:58
is there any other adding, are you thinking you add a catalog structure and then happen from string,

Matthias Miller  19:04
yeah, income statement, row,

Unknown Speaker  19:08
mean, and you're just repeating over your string of structures, your pipeless structures, essentially, yeah,

Matthias Miller  19:30
I mean, but that's not that advantageous. I mean, if we want to turn, I love how you use two nd and secondary here that that's real classy.

Speaker 2  19:42
Uh, but

Matthias Miller  19:46
it's also not that difficult just to thunk. I mean, if it were me, I would just thunk. I would have value in budget be string tables, and then you just use basic before encode and D. Code to put them in, to thunk them,

Unknown Speaker  20:04
instead of trying to go create a structure,

Matthias Miller  20:07
yeah, instead of a structure, and instead of yeah, we're doing now, I think

Unknown Speaker  20:13
that's pretty sane.

Matthias Miller  20:18
I'm also not sure why we are like, why would we use plus, plus, plus and not tabs that we can

Speaker 1  20:28
use someone doesn't live in writing components. Okay, got it, yeah, that's I'm I give it 98% chance. That's why.

Matthias Miller  20:37
Okay, so we could refactor to use tabs. That'd be a good, good start. That would dramatically simplify stuff. Next step, change it to a string table. We could check with the

Unknown Speaker  20:53
support to make sure, but I'm pretty confident, that's why. Well,

Matthias Miller  20:56
I mean, we don't expect tabs in account names or, I mean, oh no, nothing that should have tabs anywhere. So exactly,

Unknown Speaker  21:09
all right, conceivable.

Matthias Miller  21:16
The and then we can, and then we can bring in the split Income Statement complexities into here, and it's going to be slightly nightmarish. Oh, but the fun thing is that we could then

Unknown Speaker  21:40
use we

Matthias Miller  21:43
want to show diagnostics. We could just add those to the repeating Column list and conditionally also show the diagnostic columns so

Matthias Miller  22:09
if we wanted to, but I don't know that we need to. It would sum them. But who cares? All right, I think you have me persuaded until I get into it and I'm like, the preface is the other main thing. But that can be that's, that's fine.

Speaker 1  22:32
I'm happy you have a if statement. Yeah, yeah, terrible,

Matthias Miller  22:40
yeah, if, or some conditional check boxes, or, I don't know, something, oh sure, yeah, that would actually, yeah. I mean, this is, this is like, I think what would make sense actually, is on here having something like show,

Unknown Speaker  23:00
let's see how does

Matthias Miller  23:01
the percent it depends how the percent works, but basically, but basically just have a show, show revenue, or split by revenue channel and and budget amounts becomes not available in that case,

Speaker 1  23:20
if what? Oh, if, oh, you were saying with budget stuff, yeah, I mean, yeah, okay, okay, okay,

Matthias Miller  23:29
yeah, I think percentage should conceivably revenue and period, revenue display, Total Row,

Unknown Speaker  23:47
amount.

Matthias Miller  23:55
Wait a minute, divided by local revenue. Second period.

Matthias Miller  24:10
Wait, what?

Matthias Miller  24:24
If you show percentage by a

Matthias Miller  24:47
your comparison the comparison percentage is what appear to be. Okay, fine, I give up. I don't know how that's calculating. Okay. Sweet, I like it.

Unknown Speaker  25:06
Thank you, sir, yes, sir, have fun. Thanks.

Matthias Miller  25:13
All right. Let me see what these things. Let's do this. I

Matthias Miller  25:41
Oh, hang on. I mean to shoot this. Okay, so

Matthias Miller  25:57
let's do last year. I

Matthias Miller  26:09
right? So the easiest way to do this is to go

Matthias Miller  26:18
delete This guy. Yep, it let it yell at me.

Unknown Speaker  26:42
Down down here.

Matthias Miller  26:55
Okay, now it's It really doesn't like me. Chapter,

Matthias Miller  27:27
might just be easier to go through here.

Matthias Miller  27:59
So budget comparison,

Matthias Miller  28:19
let's go to Various payrolls where display rules, Total,

Matthias Miller  28:35
text,

Unknown Speaker  28:43
you said, Yeah,

Matthias Miller  28:55
value, a second period value.

Matthias Miller  29:19
Hey, look at that. All right,

Speaker 3  29:27
here's a possible user you want to log in and then log in at off zero with Google, with Facebook password, but

Matthias Miller  29:41
device pass key and off zero, use Tab. Tables, item 789,

Matthias Miller  29:50
sorry, it should be eight, 910, that tablet. Item two. 146, then did we? There's where we delete the guy.

Matthias Miller  30:21
Okay, and then,

Speaker 3  30:32
I don't know off the end. I mean, did they say that 500 contracts? So 500 call, on our updates while they were saying that they're going to host all the little guys in with

Unknown Speaker  30:49
one system to cut down on fees, like they have any

Unknown Speaker  31:00
any action piece of it that's under, like, 100 or 500 contracts to forget, wedding shooting,

Speaker 3  31:10
they'll have them all together in one so loop system, interesting, and that that's just the guy that I'm losing fee so that, I mean, if E formless company wants to be more, just have their own system. They're welcome too. So we actually have the level of segregation.

Matthias Miller  31:26
Okay, so then let's go.

Unknown Speaker  31:43
Okay, less than 500 you'll be in A shared system.

Matthias Miller  31:53
Period. Look,

Unknown Speaker  32:17
yuck, 20,000 i

Speaker 4  32:24
of the potential for breakage is kind of wild if we ever change,

Unknown Speaker  32:32
yeah, trying

Matthias Miller  32:37
to think of the best way to rip into this without completely destroying the world and,

Unknown Speaker  32:50
yeah and

Matthias Miller  33:07
out. Why wouldn't we even

Unknown Speaker  33:17
that often? Really even

Matthias Miller  33:24
that often for

Matthias Miller  33:47
Okay. It seems to me like, well, this is at least one potentially simple way to I.

Unknown Speaker  35:10
BV, budget, I

Matthias Miller  35:23
Okay, all right, so we have the Current, yeah, second period, budget, second, 020202 and then Here, what if we just did something like this? I

Unknown Speaker  36:12
eventually avoid hard coding the first tablet items.

Matthias Miller  36:18
Yes, I think I'm not completely sure I haven't gotten that far in my head how I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this, but this thing should be the incremental step. So then you could feed your phone, put in an airplane

Unknown Speaker  36:30
mode, bloke, if it uses

Unknown Speaker  36:34
a shared secret when it's

Speaker 3  36:38
set up, it shares a secret between Google server,

Matthias Miller  36:45
even the debug. What's the debug? Number One, two, they

Unknown Speaker  36:57
know they have a shared they always know what it's going

Unknown Speaker  37:02
to be. Yeah. Because that's

Unknown Speaker  37:06
something that we can easily do the best you

Matthias Miller  37:38
All right, so, then, theoretically, then Hold

Speaker 4  37:40
up a sec. Yep, something doesn't look great. Tab, list, item, zero, text. You're passing in a you're passing a full string table. Aren't you

Matthias Miller  37:55
passing a tab delimited

Unknown Speaker  37:56
list? Okay,

Matthias Miller  38:00
sure, this guy,

Unknown Speaker  38:04
okay, okay, gotcha. Gotcha.

Matthias Miller  38:05
Paul, this is the column so we pull that out, yep, basically for decode it, yep, all right, so then this guy becomes budget. Okay, budget amount, no, it's, this is what you don't current budget. Okay, this is second budget,

Matthias Miller  38:46
this guy's current budget, and then we have the Here at the

Unknown Speaker  39:07
this is the current

Matthias Miller  39:13
second period value.

Matthias Miller  39:24
Well, we just completely screwed stuff up. Let's do this look up.

Matthias Miller  39:53
Let's do this actually. I.

Matthias Miller  40:06
What's weird,

Unknown Speaker  40:12
I counted wrong.

Unknown Speaker  40:15
Okay, fine.

Unknown Speaker  40:18
I think you might have counted your your first concat advance. Advanced parameter,

Matthias Miller  40:27
let's just go sanity check that.

Matthias Miller  40:34
Okay. We have 1-234-567-8910, 11. Oh, sure enough. Oh, look at that. All right, let's try budget comparison. Prior period, one, 123, 1231, 23 which? We have budget numbers. So no, we do several authentication so theoretic, we don't show budget totals. Oh, that's nifty. Let's show percentages too. It's you.

Speaker 3  41:20
By itself. It's just so important. Yeah, it's what

Matthias Miller  41:28
we lost percentages.

Matthias Miller  41:35
I know why. Stop.

Matthias Miller  41:48
Probably it's something to do with this.

Matthias Miller  41:56
The display,

Matthias Miller  42:15
budget, current, so this is just a

Matthias Miller  42:24
hang on,

Unknown Speaker  43:06
just feel like we're planning to scale this so many people, I'm

Matthias Miller  43:19
not sure what that tab is. That tab was

Unknown Speaker  43:31
for that would just be on the contact record.

Matthias Miller  43:39
So if this is all the rows I would assume, and if the type equals what we're going for a

Matthias Miller  44:10
a string, table, column, it's got to Be the is that the column delimiter? Yeah, that's it, which was just, I don't know it was fun to put it in there, but completely unnecessary. All right, so we got percentages now.

Unknown Speaker  44:35
Interesting percentages,

Matthias Miller  44:41
yeah, but accurate percentages, I mean, okay, this is the negative number. Sure, yes,

Unknown Speaker  44:49
right, yep.

Matthias Miller  44:56
Okay, so. Yeah, okay. So now we have more hard coding once again, but we have the current second, current budget second, yanking these. Okay, so we get the second, get the current budget. Budget comparison would be the second budget we have this helper thing to look it up, which we tested. Here we are doing a list substitute and summing. Just great. Here we're getting current. It's right. Okay, so then here, just for kicks and giggles, 67679, and 10 should no longer exist. Let's do six, seven, fine.

Unknown Speaker  46:21
What size and 10

Matthias Miller  46:26
should probably be widths. All right, sweet, I'm

Matthias Miller  47:10
do we want to we?

Unknown Speaker  47:31
Me and

Matthias Miller  47:34
hang on thinking,

Matthias Miller  47:41
Okay, let's go back into that where This complexity

Unknown Speaker  47:53
lives profit.

Matthias Miller  48:29
You would make sense.

Matthias Miller  49:15
What if we would

Matthias Miller  49:26
okay, this will break stuff everywhere, okay, the current remaining question in my mind is, do we Want to use one string table for all the do we want

Matthias Miller  49:56
to use one string table for all the values? Or do you do we want two string tables with the same. Keys, one for the current value and one for the budget.

Speaker 4  50:07
I would rather not have two string tables. If we don't need to. I'm gonna do would it mean, would it mean double? Wouldn't we get an extra parameter for most of the places that we're looking for, string tables,

Unknown Speaker  50:26
yeah,

Matthias Miller  50:27
well, or you have just completely split the functions.

Speaker 4  50:31
Yeah, I don't love that. I think we already have plenty going on.

Matthias Miller  50:36
Let's do this. Okay, let's do how do we

Matthias Miller  50:56
want to do this? If we would do a

Matthias Miller  51:08
do this, do a new macro.

Matthias Miller  52:28
Okay, so then we have

Unknown Speaker  52:37
the account.

Matthias Miller  52:40
Percent,

Matthias Miller  52:50
you value

Unknown Speaker  52:54
budget.

Matthias Miller  52:56
Let's just do this sign parameter, V, value of B, I

Matthias Miller  53:36
all Right now let's see what we can Do.

Matthias Miller  53:45
Oh, this, this one's easy.

Matthias Miller  54:02
One is this one is.

Matthias Miller  55:55
Wow. Substitute can't take

Matthias Miller  56:03
different item, cat.

Matthias Miller  56:20
And then this guy, wherever we were, becomes brain, dead simple. I'm

Unknown Speaker  56:45
Wait.

Matthias Miller  56:52
Why are we doing account total, not subtype total? I don't know. That might be why the budgets aren't totaling.

Matthias Miller  57:14
All right load display row,

Unknown Speaker  57:54
have a case, and this is being added.

Matthias Miller  58:45
Makes me so then here, this becomes, let's substitute

Unknown Speaker  59:21
local. Value, and I

Matthias Miller  59:33
guess it should probably be a string. You.

Matthias Miller  1:00:02
Did I miss percent? And then three? Type, row, text, bold, underline, no,

Matthias Miller  1:00:21
that looks right, three, three. So is that okay? 233, so it

Unknown Speaker  1:00:29
must be in here. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:00:47
will will clean these up further later, but We're just going to start with this.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:45
Current, second, second.

Matthias Miller  1:02:15
Be. What else did we screw up somewhere? Can I add a number two string? The string? Oh, you are so helpful. I

Matthias Miller  1:02:44
have to have string.

Matthias Miller  1:02:54
Those are all strings. This guy,

Matthias Miller  1:03:13
what its name is, we can i

Unknown Speaker  1:03:40
All right, we're Next,

Matthias Miller  1:03:45
if we just did this.

Matthias Miller  1:03:55
That guy,

Unknown Speaker  1:03:58
that guy,

Matthias Miller  1:04:09
oh, it's in the main we're all the way out in the main table.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:13
That fast.

Matthias Miller  1:04:18
Okay, nice. All right, then we need,

Matthias Miller  1:04:33
so if it's subtype, total,

Unknown Speaker  1:04:41
round rows, rose i.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:21
Suitable so

Matthias Miller  1:05:24
With These

Unknown Speaker  1:06:16
Ah,

Matthias Miller  1:06:37
okay, so in gross profit, okay, so now,

Matthias Miller  1:06:45
subtype, total, current, if the OP, expense, rows, okay, so, sign V, gross profit, string, table, equals, list, substitute, I mean, why don't we do this on? No, we only want this on the load values, pipe list,

Matthias Miller  1:07:15
pipe list, and then This would be current item, plus tab plus string.

Matthias Miller  1:07:42
I'm poor Joel is over there figuring out ATP registration, which is required for sending text messages, and, let's just say bureaucracy. Okay, here's the bottom line, marketers and do a fantastic job of ruining freedom for everybody else. Let's just say that. Yeah,

Speaker 4  1:08:32
I'll be happy, if trying to figure that out, I'll never be a part of my life.

Matthias Miller  1:08:38
It's yeah, it's not,

Matthias Miller  1:08:47
it's not the greatest thing in the world. Look up.

Matthias Miller  1:09:17
Yes, so then let's

Matthias Miller  1:09:40
value string, table, the operating income, current, item.

Matthias Miller  1:10:08
Okay, and then here,

Matthias Miller  1:10:21
match something up up there, and I know what it is, Yes.

Matthias Miller  1:10:39
Yeah, oh, gracious Vina income second, okay?

Matthias Miller  1:10:59
I mean, there are numbers here, so it's top numbers actually look familiar. So budget, we lost the budget. Budget. How did we lose the budget?

Speaker 4  1:11:20
Question Congress has been asking themselves for the last 200 years,

Matthias Miller  1:11:26
as well as all The Amish grandmas getting their newspaper.

Matthias Miller  1:11:37
Okay? So

Unknown Speaker  1:12:00
right?

Matthias Miller  1:12:03
Let's try this.

Matthias Miller  1:12:17
This is, this is always how I do my write, my backers.

Matthias Miller  1:12:35
Okay, so budgets in there? Oh, I know what's going on? No, let's do this. Let's delete this guy again.

Matthias Miller  1:13:15
Maybe is just, we just did those two. Hmm,

Matthias Miller  1:13:34
okay, here's the good news, though, but we don't use budget key to value key. Hey, look at that. They're back. All right, so let's take that one out. The good news is that a simple regression test is very likely to cover what we need. All right, so now, um,

Speaker 2  1:14:00
going

Speaker 4  1:14:08
to take a minute and be right back. All right, sounds good?

Matthias Miller  1:16:29
So you get to experience the benefit of me having had to meticulously refactor all kinds of code and being absolutely paranoid of breaking things. So hence the,

Unknown Speaker  1:16:52
I don't know,

Matthias Miller  1:16:54
breaking changes down into small bite size pieces that you can actually overview and hopefully, hopefully get it about, right. Okay, so then here's the heading budget, okay, so Then here we have a

Matthias Miller  1:17:30
hey, this guy. Hey,

Matthias Miller  1:17:45
Loc, revenue display row, I'm I stay

Matthias Miller  1:18:35
why do we even have this? Why not just do we

Matthias Miller  1:18:56
that's Going to go anyway.

Matthias Miller  1:19:02
This Guy is

Matthias Miller  1:19:29
and then I

Matthias Miller  1:19:53
all columns when I set my DS, okay, fine. This would be a.

Matthias Miller  1:20:08
Um, okay, that's not right.

Matthias Miller  1:20:30
I mean, yeah, oh, except the heading is missing. I think it's missing new lines. I

Unknown Speaker  1:21:06
Yeah, okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:21:11
yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:34
So then,

Matthias Miller  1:21:39
all right, repeat off the value columns.

Matthias Miller  1:21:47
Then if you look at the row, amount, repeat list item, repeat call item, add a heading macro and an ID display row divided by revenue. This is the percent, and then we have this divided by the budget. Then we have the budget column. We kill a whole bunch of macros. Kill more macros, kill more macros, more heading macro, so it's amount or date range, and then we have kill more macros. And now if we look for second as a whole word, we have it where we generate the string table over generate the heading over, generate the list, concurrent, generate The values, generate the heading, generate the list. Okay,

Matthias Miller  1:23:02
that that's pretty snazzy. All right, so then,

Matthias Miller  1:23:20
here comes the fun part.

Matthias Miller  1:23:32
Actually, this would be very easy to test. I

Matthias Miller  1:23:47
look at that.

Matthias Miller  1:23:55
If I go into settings here, it should show the

Unknown Speaker  1:24:01
old

Matthias Miller  1:24:03
obnoxious, everything.

Unknown Speaker  1:24:05
Oh yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:24:09
sweet, have I just compare against my standard versus non standard version? Okay, so now, is there any further

Matthias Miller  1:24:36
simplification we want to do? I

Matthias Miller  1:24:43
for example.

Matthias Miller  1:25:08
Should we have a

Matthias Miller  1:25:15
think? The answer is yes. Why wouldn't we have a catalog list called income income state column, income Income Statement?

Matthias Miller  1:25:46
Columns and

Matthias Miller  1:25:56
and then we would validate that.

Matthias Miller  1:26:30
Okay, should that list so that list, we could force, we could add catalog validation that every item in the retail channels list. Sorry, revenue Channels List is also a member in that list. Do we want to

Matthias Miller  1:26:59
add the a budget list items as well. So,

Matthias Miller  1:27:21
basically what it would look like is something like

Matthias Miller  1:27:42
this. So you would have current,

Matthias Miller  1:27:56
you would have retail so wholesale,

Matthias Miller  1:28:13
second,

Unknown Speaker  1:28:15
budget, second. I'm

Matthias Miller  1:28:27
in a steel.

Unknown Speaker  1:30:51
Matching budget non budget items, budget columns, oh, Sure. Oh, matter doesn't matter.

Unknown Speaker  1:31:03
Okay, Never mind. Do

Matthias Miller  1:32:40
worked it out.

Matthias Miller  1:33:07
List, filter, list, filter, well, yeah, seems sane.

Unknown Speaker  1:33:47
Okay,

Matthias Miller  1:33:56
and then here's where.

Matthias Miller  1:36:25
Should almost be a

Matthias Miller  1:36:33
macro for

Matthias Miller  1:36:40
for the key plus tablet string, But that could potentially be a to do. Okay? So?

Matthias Miller  1:37:16
I'm kidding. Should still use it

Matthias Miller  1:37:54
Okay, so there's that.

Matthias Miller  1:38:11
Ah, wow, I really am putting This in the wrong place. I

Matthias Miller  1:39:13
Okay, so

Matthias Miller  1:39:20
the other tweak that I would like to make here i

Unknown Speaker  1:39:58
is a. A I

Matthias Miller  1:40:51
actually, It's simpler than this.

Matthias Miller  1:42:03
I use a column is current, then this, if it's this,

Unknown Speaker  1:43:15
FYI, I'll probably drop in about 15 minutes.

Matthias Miller  1:43:18
Okay, I should drop about then, too, sure. Okay, so then we take, give it the current item, this in the account.

Matthias Miller  1:43:44
And please this all

Matthias Miller  1:43:54
right, what don't you like about me? I

Matthias Miller  1:44:10
Okay, a little bit of further genericizing.

Speaker 2  1:44:22
My Okay,

Matthias Miller  1:44:37
now we are ready for business, so now we get to add this the i.

Unknown Speaker  1:45:07
All right,

Matthias Miller  1:45:10
you can't do comparisons. I don't care about percentages. I don't really care about care about anything else. You just can't do that over overlaps, oh, great thanks. 20s, this would be 20 and 35 i

Unknown Speaker  1:45:47
A so let's

Matthias Miller  1:45:51
go ahead and write with a split.

Unknown Speaker  1:46:01
And we have so then,

Matthias Miller  1:46:24
hey, too, I'm getting a call. You want to just drop pick it

Unknown Speaker  1:46:27
up tomorrow? Sounds good? Yep, see you.
