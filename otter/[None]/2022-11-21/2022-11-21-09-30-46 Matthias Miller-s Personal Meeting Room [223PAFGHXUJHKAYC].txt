Unknown Speaker  03:12
Hey Matthias. Good morning.

Unknown Speaker  03:14
Good morning. How are you?

Unknown Speaker  03:16
Yeah, I'm doing fine. How are you doing? I'm doing well. So

Speaker 1  03:26
you haven't seen for a long time, I think for several months are like that.

Unknown Speaker  03:33
Yep. Silly. Everything's

Unknown Speaker  03:40
going well, on a site. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  03:44
it is. It's going well, I got a little bit of a bug came down with a little bit of something over the weekend, so

Unknown Speaker  03:52
I'm sure. Yeah. So it's been it's been a little bit of,

Matthias Miller  04:04
it's been a bit busy on this side, but overall, it's been doing well. How about you?

Speaker 1  04:13
Yeah. doing quite well, actually. We're preparing for at least Mike and John's visit coming.

Speaker 2  04:21
January end. Oh, good. Yeah. Great. So I

Speaker 1  04:29
was thinking, if we can work on three months at like January, at least December on November 21. So we have 20 days to plan something for January. And if we can have the February and March on hold

Unknown Speaker  04:50
so you're buffering or something like that? Let's wait and

Speaker 1  05:10
actually stop the video and seeing if there is an internet issue

Unknown Speaker  05:14
still have this

Matthias Miller  05:30
having it I can stop my video and see if that helps

Unknown Speaker  05:35
we're gonna want this use the same alright so they be there on a pump can you hear me Can you hear me now? Okay great

Speaker 1  07:44
I'm trying to add my mobile data actually

Unknown Speaker  07:49
gotcha okay so what I guess should we

Speaker 1  08:02
retry the January ad or single completely new angle

Unknown Speaker  08:08
um Well the question is January

Matthias Miller  09:29
yeah I mean it didn't really get 2022 It didn't generate high quality leads

Matthias Miller  09:38
2021 We didn't run it 2020

Unknown Speaker  09:47
We had ones

Matthias Miller  09:50
reasonably solid lead

Unknown Speaker  10:00
no budget no budget one that

Matthias Miller  10:23
seemed like a reasonable one but they went dark

Matthias Miller  10:43
mean it seems a little bit to me like

Matthias Miller  10:51
most people start marketing for New Year's stuff in October in November by December it's stale by January it's over

Unknown Speaker  11:04
and I don't see it as

Matthias Miller  11:07
certainly not something that has worked fantastic hasn't hasn't been a wild success in the past

Unknown Speaker  11:12
feel like we're a

Matthias Miller  11:35
bit out of the loop on what's showing up on sales conversations

Unknown Speaker  11:45
as a side note no

Matthias Miller  12:18
if you're responsible for coming up with a new angle in January that had a 50% or greater likelihood of success,

Unknown Speaker  12:24
which how would you go about it

Unknown Speaker  12:27
sorry, say that again.

Unknown Speaker  12:31
If you had if

Matthias Miller  12:37
if you had so if we had to come up with a new angle for an ad for January with a let's just say 50% or higher likelihood of success but with a new angle I'm curious curious what your thoughts

Unknown Speaker  12:55
thoughts would be okay, I'm trying to think. I'm always

Speaker 1  13:35
going back to some angle of like, okay, this is a new work Fresh Start something like that or, or not fresh start but people are motivated in January starting gym

Unknown Speaker  13:49
starting

Speaker 1  13:51
doing commitments and stuff like that. So this is a good time to look at your business plan for that I'm just I am sure but also thinking like if it is a good time to give a lead magnet if not completely new. But some of those which we have used it and repurpose it to fit with the New Year angle. Okay. Our,

Unknown Speaker  14:32
our ideal client

Unknown Speaker  14:35
is from what I've observed,

Matthias Miller  14:45
well, I'm going to make some assumptions and we can argue whether these assumptions are

Unknown Speaker  14:52
hang on I need to switch my airpot here

Matthias Miller  15:06
So assumption number one our clients are more mature business people

Unknown Speaker  15:16
and so so

Matthias Miller  15:19
I mean well we know this to be true if it's just a small business we can't really help them so they are mature business people they have experience they've been around the block assumption number two if they are mature and relatively proactive they've already done a reasonable amount of planning for 2023 Right so they at least have some thought in what they want to do they might not have you know it's not always very

Unknown Speaker  15:54
in depth so

Matthias Miller  16:08
there is this question then of mean you could almost go down the angle of

Unknown Speaker  16:35
how does Okay, first of all

Matthias Miller  16:43
let's assume we could we could make a third assumption that what they want to do is they want to integrate this into their existing plans not dramatically alter their existing plans

Unknown Speaker  17:00
right yeah.

Matthias Miller  17:04
And so what's the promise benefit Well, custom software may help you get there faster maybe more reliable solution may actually be or maybe the argument is just you could actually do this and it could fit into your existing plans it doesn't have to turn everything upside down.

Unknown Speaker  18:13
Well we can.

Speaker 1  19:19
Yeah, I, this one equals with what we're

Unknown Speaker  19:24
saying.

Unknown Speaker  19:57
But really

Unknown Speaker  20:03
Maybe it is maybe it is as simple as that? Are you thinking we'll be back

Speaker 1  22:28
as well. So I am just trying to think if the first that one you have set your goals and what tools do you that I think equals and we can play with it and this was executions I am trying to think if software is our software is directly related to the execution or how can we collect or if it can actually connects or not I'm not saying these are that way I'm just trying to think like how is our software more connected to

Unknown Speaker  23:06
execution than planning QUESTION So, just think

Speaker 1  23:27
that if it is an accounting software if sin order management then execution it goes on most still execution is through the people that are working if it is like HR software or accounting software

Unknown Speaker  23:51
not much. Very rough concepts but we had to draw a link between those two

Speaker 1  24:53
so, is this one correct when you have the right tools? Is this one almost connected with the UFC to your goals? What was the You need to reach them

Matthias Miller  25:03
think you could think you could almost connect them but you're taking it through a different angle

Unknown Speaker  25:07
you're saying

Matthias Miller  25:13
so you're basically instead of saying What tool do you need to reach tools you need to reach them you're saying basically, you're taking a step back and you're saying What tool do you need to help you I guess it really is the same thing except it's using the term execution

Unknown Speaker  25:31
so

Speaker 1  25:55
if preference I'm liking this angle of view like the goal and what tool so if we start the headline with that way and then in the body we go deeper into that why like two is important

Speaker 2  26:09
and how custom software can help them

Speaker 1  26:13
or if it is right or do you have other preference between this one and the execution version?

Matthias Miller  26:44
In my opinion, the execution angle is more compelling it's more likely to say

Unknown Speaker  26:48
well, there's

Matthias Miller  26:54
there's there's a upside and a downside it's possible that what tools do you need to reach them implies a question mark but it's also true

Unknown Speaker  27:05
that we're

Matthias Miller  27:07
you know, it may create intrigue Okay, here's but but it also is not that dissimilar from the approaches we've used in the past it's basically implying that you need a tool that in order to reach them

Unknown Speaker  27:27
and there's a difference between

Matthias Miller  28:01
if you've heard the statistics about the people who write down their goals

Unknown Speaker  28:09
people who don't

Matthias Miller  28:15
how likely people are. According sample 25% of people have been in their New Year's resolution 60% of people have been in them within six

Unknown Speaker  29:22
months.

Matthias Miller  29:32
Were 2% more likely to achieve your goals just by writing them down?

Unknown Speaker  29:40
Of course I'm still not sure how this actually ties the bridge back but

Matthias Miller  30:21
Well the only answer is to test

Unknown Speaker  30:35
we could also be

Matthias Miller  30:37
we could also we could also write two angles here and get feedback from the rest of the team

Unknown Speaker  30:42
Sure so let's say that we did.

Matthias Miller  34:11
Like the tangibility of this

Unknown Speaker  34:22
review ways to clean it up

Matthias Miller  34:53
does this mean this is a lengthy headline is this literally what you're thinking that headline would be?

Unknown Speaker  34:58
Asked sorry that again Oh

Matthias Miller  35:01
this is literally the Is this what you're thinking the headline would be is there another hook

Unknown Speaker  35:05
that you're thinking of Oh this one or just be

Speaker 1  35:14
something like you have set your goals but do you have the tools to reach them or this is also what was directly to reach them is also fine or do you have the tools to reach them

Speaker 1  35:39
do you have right to squeeze them or or do we need to eat these are just different tweaks Do you want to say that yes your business goals are the goals the light that this is a business goal

Matthias Miller  36:31
okay maybe I'm reading into this little too much seems maybe slightly insulting that somebody would set goals but not actually be able to.

Speaker 1  37:37
If you ask me I will say that the how sharp is your ex reversal is more

Unknown Speaker  37:44
interesting because

Speaker 1  37:48
it's not boring like ever saying that Apple is boring. But between these two this is something like if I look at an ad I would be interested to read the next slide okay. Where are they talking about? X and sharpness

Unknown Speaker  38:08
yeah

Unknown Speaker  38:15
yeah

Unknown Speaker  38:17
I agree I

Matthias Miller  38:18
think for I mean I think for a target demographic I think this is really going to catch their attention

Speaker 1  38:29
and he was thinking that is the headline and apparently this person is the board mate

Unknown Speaker  38:33
Yeah, that's right I actually like that that's interesting I mean, I think

Matthias Miller  39:25
I think this can be cleaned up a bit. What if what if we?

Unknown Speaker  39:27
Loops don't know your suggestions on this one do you like it just the way it is? Okay, let's be rigid

Unknown Speaker  43:30
think the first one is more clear and

Unknown Speaker  43:34
looks okay to me

Speaker 1  43:39
I am thinking about that symptom sorry

Unknown Speaker  43:43
Sure so you

Speaker 1  43:47
were thinking that plan right as you look at your boots to prevent with the tree do you have that

Unknown Speaker  43:54
so let's just what about this

Matthias Miller  43:59
doesn't really have to be complicated discuss with a custom software can help you reach your business goals more quickly and easily in 2023

Unknown Speaker  44:06
yeah stop using

Matthias Miller  44:10
at least stop using long words

Unknown Speaker  44:12
yeah

Unknown Speaker  44:26
i think i like

Unknown Speaker  44:27
it yeah well, there's that proven ads are you worry there's the vehicle one This one continues

Matthias Miller  45:07
just just continues to work it was a referral admittedly so maybe that one's not related and

Speaker 1  45:32
that is generically speaking is sometimes also difficult to clearly pinpoint right that maybe someone has been following our ad for

Unknown Speaker  45:45
three months and

Speaker 1  45:48
then he looks at one ad and connects but maybe the last was actually affecting the

Unknown Speaker  45:58
stuffing that just yeah for example

Matthias Miller  46:10
this one worked well previously but we haven't

Unknown Speaker  46:13
really got much All right well read this one last March What about this one we rented exactly a year ago or it would be a year Sure,

Speaker 1  48:00
just one thing I'm thinking if the January and February sounds similar if you want to have the similar angle or a different angle I don't have a choice

Unknown Speaker  48:11
preference what's possible

Matthias Miller  48:20
this one is one that we haven't tried in a while either

Matthias Miller  48:30
we could play around with a different term to four pillars of the

Unknown Speaker  48:33
almost

Matthias Miller  48:45
four pillars of a streamlined business, accuracy, efficiency consistency transparency

Unknown Speaker  49:00
What are your thoughts? Are this word Your proposal

Unknown Speaker  50:51
so you are thinking that one four pillars changing with wording and that yeah I'm fine with this and I'm fine with the other one Mrs stem one has

Matthias Miller  51:19
notice somewhat similar to has some similarity in this one

Speaker 2  51:29
and I have a bias towards something that has proved been proven to work in the past

Matthias Miller  51:35
and I understand there is this thing where people following but there does seem to be some pattern as far as what pushes people over the edge as

Unknown Speaker  51:41
well I don't know I don't really feel strongly about it

Unknown Speaker  51:52
which one which one you choose the sun

Matthias Miller  51:59
yeah this one I mean we could also do a variation

Unknown Speaker  52:01
click this one I think the missing system

Speaker 1  52:20
one is more direct and clear than this for

Unknown Speaker  52:25
everyone's greed

Matthias Miller  52:46
The other option would be the SAFE Investment one

Unknown Speaker  52:54
quite a year go ahead.

Speaker 1  53:03
So we can reserve that for like April or May when whenever we are next for the

Speaker 2  53:11
movie net and this is 186 of the SAFE Investment

Matthias Miller  53:26
Yeah, I mean unless you wanted to use the safe investment to break it up from January

Speaker 2  53:30
we use the misting systems in May federal caregiver preference this looks good

Matthias Miller  54:00
yeah. And then are we are we using a I don't really have an opinion I mean I can see where you're coming from like zero coming from them maybe bringing it up I don't I don't

Unknown Speaker  54:11
feel strongly the

Matthias Miller  54:25
six months too soon to rerun the

Speaker 2  54:29
vehicle ad. When do you want to run this? If we would do this for March for article

Speaker 1  54:41
No, I like that. I think it's fine. Six months is isn't long. We remember it very clearly but people seeing the same error after six months.

Unknown Speaker  54:59
So The other idea would be if there wasn't a place we want to do another be like Ben April and if so so my tears working

Unknown Speaker  55:21
sorry go ahead

Unknown Speaker  55:23
sorry No go ahead

Speaker 1  55:26
do you think the recession is there any concern around recession into the oh yes tea and stuff that

Matthias Miller  55:37
there is there is it's died down from the conversations that I've seen but I don't really know how big of a concern it is. I mean, I I personally don't believe that I mean, we're gonna see some turbulence over the next three to four years but

Unknown Speaker  55:56
based on real estate cycles

Matthias Miller  55:59
it's the recession is probably actually about three or four years away but and I've seen a little less talk about it

Unknown Speaker  56:12
but yeah I

Matthias Miller  56:21
don't know so I guess all that to say I don't really know how how how much people are thinking or talking

Unknown Speaker  56:26
about it okay, so what

Speaker 1  56:55
to do Do we have anything in pipeline for B like then

Unknown Speaker  57:01
we've done

Matthias Miller  57:02
things in the past like I mean we had

Unknown Speaker  57:07
the bed bath for Beth and Ben

Matthias Miller  57:11
we had but we don't really have anything

Unknown Speaker  57:21
you know one thing that

Matthias Miller  57:22
could be interesting is

Matthias Miller  57:30
what is another angle

Unknown Speaker  57:38
can you combine be like bend even like this

Matthias Miller  57:48
could we do it be like Ben that captures this message perhaps.

Unknown Speaker  58:47
Okay, so

Matthias Miller  59:08
I don't really have time to to nail this down, but maybe we should set a set a meeting and we know we do need plenty of lead time to get this done. So

Speaker 2  59:19
maybe we should set another meeting to follow up on this. This January.

Speaker 1  59:26
As well your schedule our December I'm pretty sure I have white. Occupy so do you think if we see it in January, we'll be able to do that. Yeah. Because we'll have to say that by March 10. So if we'll see January, we still have two months.

Unknown Speaker  59:49
Yeah. Can we do So we could

Matthias Miller  1:00:13
do the same time on January 9 on Monday or I could do at this point I could do an hour earlier

Unknown Speaker  1:00:18
as well to have a preference

Unknown Speaker  1:00:22
one on one our idea sounds fine for the time being

Speaker 3  1:00:29
well yeah, we should we can at least have something on the calendar we can move on

Unknown Speaker  1:00:38
Okay sounds good.

Matthias Miller  1:00:45
Sounds good. I will get that over and then do we need to schedule a follow up call with or meeting some time with

Unknown Speaker  1:00:58
you find her so we have one

Speaker 1  1:01:01
new ad right the the one we're going to run for genuine but the other two are moving stuff like that.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:12
Sure. What do you suggest I am just

Speaker 1  1:01:19
bit concerned about this schedule because we have 20 days for that one. And so how is the shoot in December? Or when do you want to seek

Unknown Speaker  1:01:32
them when was the last time that you did

Matthias Miller  1:01:49
it seems like it's been a really long time and it seems like it would be good to write

Unknown Speaker  1:01:54
a C marketing meeting

Matthias Miller  1:02:04
back in August perhaps so we don't have since I guess I am

Speaker 1  1:02:15
okay, let me tell what are the problem here? So I'm not sure about my next two weeks evening schedules and there is also that World Cup tournament going on and everything like I just yeah and the Christmas is coming so just after one week all those programs in December that I don't know yet that were what is going to happen so I so having meeting with you is more flexible that I can say that okay, it has let's plan these are not defined so they are same thing but yes, we haven't done with them for a long time so you have anything in mind if we want to do what can be the

Unknown Speaker  1:03:02
entity Well, I mean, I think it's

Matthias Miller  1:03:08
does depend a little bit on what your schedule is like I mean I could do

Speaker 2  1:03:17
December the fifth again, check the date is that is Monday right? Yeah. The one question will be if we do

Speaker 1  1:03:32
that on what will happen to the January add because that we will need to send by December 14 What was

Matthias Miller  1:04:00
let's let's take it take a step back what I mean wasn't wasn't it our plan to do this every

Unknown Speaker  1:04:06
quarter say where are we planning to meet with them every

Unknown Speaker  1:04:14
three months?

Unknown Speaker  1:04:15
Yeah, yeah I mean, we could take a look at Thursday Wait, where is this Wednesday? Next week is already quite full. It's possible that we could do

Matthias Miller  1:05:20
We could do I could do Wednesday the 30th I believe

Speaker 2  1:05:27
we have to talk to you that's right. Yeah that's heartedness

Unknown Speaker  1:05:37
was so that is next week Wednesday, right?

Unknown Speaker  1:05:41
Yeah, that's right. Next was this the south need to be so far

Speaker 1  1:05:56
so what Okay, yeah, but whether they are free or not this is a question but yes, we can try that. Do we want to reach them and see or should I reach out to them?

Unknown Speaker  1:06:11
I can reach out to them see

Speaker 1  1:06:14
and I will say we do send the initial plan for the January ad to other team members or after sitting with them then we can send

Matthias Miller  1:06:27
no I would send it to the other team members right away.

Speaker 1  1:06:30
Okay, I'll send that tomorrow then and let me know if car teeth work for the

Unknown Speaker  1:06:35
vendor yeah

Unknown Speaker  1:06:46
okay, then we know what time they are fine.

Matthias Miller  1:06:50
Okay. And How late are you willing to go on Wednesday

Unknown Speaker  1:07:01
I think the later is

Speaker 1  1:07:02
better. I'm fine. No problem. Existence interdependent this team are thinking

Unknown Speaker  1:07:10
more late. No, not later than 1030 That is fine.

Matthias Miller  1:07:17
I mean, I can I have to be done by

Speaker 2  1:07:20
1030 or soon thereafter. So. Okay, so probably be I'll ask her something between 11 to 1230. Eastern, which would be nine to 1030. Okay, I'm fine. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:07:46
sounds good. Okay, okay. Have a good,

Unknown Speaker  1:07:49
sounds good. Appreciate
