All right, so what if we would have a? What do we get some mincio tests for people interested in pipeline, those types of things around something around the design? Like, what is the developer? I think it's like, I mean, I think this is the question, can we go after the Joshua's and have Josh as the door to these? Or do we go after?

Surely there are other development shops that have this same requirement. In other words, I wonder if developers are the gateway to these companies. So what would happen if you did a mincio road test to these places around this thing? And you were even this other dude, that's sending the emails?

Like, I don't actually want to do the implementation. I want to do the design. I don't want to do that.

Yeah. Interesting. So mincio road test painpoints. And we index of the dashes of the world. It's similar people. Maybe an interesting avenue to go down.
