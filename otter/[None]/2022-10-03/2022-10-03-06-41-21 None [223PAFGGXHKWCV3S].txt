Hey, Nick, I wanted to take a moment to outline the the IA fr changes that we had discussed. I think it's this on the company we would have four fields, sorry, in our g of four, four fields, the estimated percentage, the accrual account, the FDI account and the expense account. And all of those accounts would be tied out to the accounting system. And then we would have a on the building RG we would then have similar to building you have a similar RG of accrual account estimated dollars in actual dollars. So the basic process is when you build it, we would populate that RG based on the company's estimated current estimated percentages and when it gets sold. It gets expensed out using the estimated or actual dollars, whichever ones we have. And then we have a reconciliation process that takes a it's an X 30 that takes a date range and expense account and the actual dollars for that for that expense account. And it updates all of the building RG RGS with the actual dollars and then it creates adjustments for the FTA accounts if they're not sold, and it creates adjustments for expenses if they are sold. I don't know if there's a way that you could outline this in a proposal that's similar to what we do for similar to what we do in the in the client proposal but if this would be possible that'd be fantastic. If nothing else, you can maybe try to put together a draft and then and we could take it from there.
