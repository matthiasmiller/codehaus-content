Unknown Speaker  00:53
Good afternoon. Matthias, good Afternoon. Hello, hello. Good

Matthias Miller  01:04
how are you guys doing?

Speaker 1  01:05
Are we muted? I can hear you. Can you hear me?

Unknown Speaker  01:09
Sounds down.

Speaker 2  01:12
There we go. There we go. Declare

Unknown Speaker  01:16
Perfect, perfect.

Unknown Speaker  01:19
Sorry, confusion on the meeting.

Matthias Miller  01:23
No worries.

Speaker 1  01:25
So let's, let's look at that first for next meeting. So next week, I'd like to skip with Ascension Day, and unless you, unless there's something, there's a need for it, we can schedule otherwise, can't

Matthias Miller  01:41
imagine that there is

Speaker 1  01:44
and then the following Thursday, six, five won't work. So could we do with Wednesday? Work for you? I just realized I had another meeting that would I couldn't start until 1030 if we could do 1030 12 on the fourth or or we could do late.

Matthias Miller  02:12
I am trying to block out two days for on that week, um, and Wednesday and Thursday are currently blocked out, but I could go see how, how far down the scheduling road we've gone on that one?

Unknown Speaker  02:30
Well, we could,

Speaker 1  02:33
how about UC? Doesn't work very well. It would Monday work

Matthias Miller  02:38
for you? Monday be better for me?

Speaker 3  02:47
Yeah, I think so there's I got. I think I might have a recurring thing on Mondays now, I'm not sure.

Speaker 1  02:59
Oh, would two? Would Tuesday work for better for both of you?

Matthias Miller  03:05
Well, I was, I was, we were looking at blocking out Tuesday and Wednesday, and then I'm out Friday on top of that.

Unknown Speaker  03:16
So you're out. We're giving

Speaker 3  03:18
off all this next week. And the reason I'll be off Ascension Day, or what if we know one of those other days? I think I could do,

Unknown Speaker  03:28
no, we could do next week. That might be next.

Matthias Miller  03:33
Next week's wide or pretty wide open for me. I thought I had something, but let me play with all right. Yes, yeah, like radio, let's see, yeah, Tuesday,

Unknown Speaker  03:52
Tuesday or Wednesday of next week before Tuesday, Wednesday or Friday.

Matthias Miller  03:58
Well, let me see if we can get a hold of Seth and see if it makes any difference to him.

Speaker 3  04:07
Friday, we work best for anybody. Wednesday, work he just wouldn't be all day long. Hey,

Matthias Miller  04:20
hey, yeah, I mean, I can make all right? He's replying, we got him see. Okay?

Matthias Miller  04:40
That are. Okay, that works for Seth, so we can do you want to do Wednesday, 930 Eastern.

Unknown Speaker  05:10
Yeah, you said you had to make early latency. But, like, I mean that that worked two o'clock, okay, yeah, the 930 11 on the 28th

Matthias Miller  05:26
932 1128,

Unknown Speaker  05:30
and then how? Yeah, and

Matthias Miller  05:37
then it might mean that it sounds like we might have some trouble. Do you just want to wait and see them as far as the following week? Or,

Unknown Speaker  05:45
I think we just canceled for that week. Okay?

Matthias Miller  05:50
And then a side note, just a heads up, the week of the 23rd and the 30th. So the last week of June, 1 week of July, I'm going to be mostly unavailable.

Speaker 1  06:11
Okay, so no meeting. Just plan for no meeting. Then,

Matthias Miller  06:17
yeah, unless you guys need to. I mean, unless you guys just want to check in with Seth, if there's specific things you need, but

Unknown Speaker  06:25
that should be good,

Unknown Speaker  06:31
good. So

Speaker 1  06:36
got the point eight nailed down, and then otherwise, we'll just the 28 we can see about

Unknown Speaker  06:44
the next meeting. Then should

Matthias Miller  06:46
we go ahead lock in the I guess locking the 12th the 19th, if we just move the fifth to the 12th.

Speaker 1  06:59
Yeah, yeah, okay, well, 19 Yeah, Juneteenth.

Matthias Miller  07:09
My that's the that's the day my mom's getting a new knee. So

Speaker 2  07:15
this will really be liberated. Yes, exactly, yes. I Yes, good.

Speaker 1  07:25
Well, the next, I didn't put the other the next thing on the agenda, but I listened to your interview with Steve Byler and found it quite interesting. And, yeah, I enjoyed it. So the towards the end, he said something that you're, he's, you're going to be friends for life, something with about some hard work. What? I obviously didn't see that. But what was he referring to?

Matthias Miller  07:51
So there's a Japanese artist. Let me see if I can find this.

Unknown Speaker  07:59
So had you known Steve before this, we

Matthias Miller  08:01
crossed paths on Facebook. And that was the that was the extent, extent of it.

Unknown Speaker  08:11
So let me just pull this up.

Matthias Miller  08:18
And I had, he had said I had forgotten that Steve had had commented on this. So this is almost, almost exactly a year ago. The guy's name is Makoto Fujimura, and I don't remember exactly which one which, which of his paintings I had. I just had it on my desktop background and and he mentioned this generosity leads to generative work. Generative work leads to generational impact. Survival is its enemy.

Matthias Miller  08:55
And then, yeah, and so he had commented that he that he loves Fuji Mars work, but I had not realized like he's actually got multiple of his, of his paintings, which, I don't know what that runs, but those are not $50 Walmart,

Speaker 1  09:16
Steve. Steve has actual original paintings from them. That's my that's my understanding. Oh, okay, so no wonder he was Yeah, yeah. Well, Joel would have appreciated some of his, some of his comments that he made, like, thriving and stuff, were like similar to what Joel

Matthias Miller  09:45
but Joel talks about, yeah, I don't know. There's some pictures here of some of the process that he has. I don't know if I could find it. I mean, like, here's No, that's them hanging it. Uh. There was one a while back

Unknown Speaker  10:04
where,

Matthias Miller  10:07
I mean, that's the type of artwork you can kind of see there, but it's like gold and minerals on on canvas. There's another one that's really cool, mineral pigments and gold. I thought, I thought something, here's one like, here's one of his, of his art studio in progress.

Unknown Speaker  10:38
So really, evening,

Unknown Speaker  10:45
good afternoon, Dwayne, oh,

Speaker 4  10:56
my microphones being weird, so trying to fix it.

Speaker 1  11:01
So I thought you're you're gone all week. It looks like you're back in your office.

Speaker 4  11:10
Let's see. I pulled in about 20 minutes ago into the office. We're going back into Charlotte this morning. Look at

Matthias Miller  11:17
that. We're first on your list. That is, Dwayne,

Speaker 1  11:24
if it takes more than 20 seconds, then your comeback doesn't come. Something to say,

Unknown Speaker  11:38
Oh, we lost him.

Unknown Speaker  11:43
It's better than that

Speaker 1  11:46
good. So Matthias, how much time do you have? We don't have anything that takes a lot of time, but just wanted to make sure that we have,

Matthias Miller  11:53
I have let me see. I mean, I've got all kinds of stuff that is screaming for my attention, but we can take just as much time as you jelly will please. I don't really have any time finding anything. So, yeah,

Speaker 1  12:07
well, I like to, I think you should try and wrap up by

Unknown Speaker  12:11
four for sure.

Matthias Miller  12:12
Okay, that's good. I'm happy with that. So that's kind of what I was thinking. But yeah, okay, good. Well, then let's

Speaker 1  12:17
jump in. And so I just said review current projects. So I think the that's the best place to start is just go through those. I remember those. If you go to the,

Unknown Speaker  12:30
well,

Speaker 1  12:32
yeah, just go ahead and open these incidents and all right, the Yeah, that one's the one that probably spent most of our time.

Unknown Speaker  12:43
Okay, let me go pull it up and

Unknown Speaker  12:51
there we go. Let's do we'll do like this. I Yeah,

Speaker 1  13:04
all right. Or if you go to the software development to do list and just select, or,

Unknown Speaker  13:18
wow, yeah, this is good. Or is there a no

Speaker 1  13:21
if you select by user or by assignee, just put, Oh, okay. Josh made something. No, this is fine. So I think most of these are in the

Unknown Speaker  13:36
Yeah, we got this one,

Speaker 1  13:39
so we talked about this briefly last time I think,

Matthias Miller  13:58
sorry trying to fix a minute for Open Office to spin up on my computer for some reason.

Matthias Miller  14:11
Guess if I actually have it, I don't know that I have installed. You

Speaker 1  14:18
could open it on your site, and you could, wow, yeah, if you Want to,

Unknown Speaker  14:35
yeah, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  14:39
actually, both of those files.

Speaker 4  14:43
Sorry, guys, I don't know what's going on with my microphone. Thing is not working right, and I don't know it's being grumpy. I

Matthias Miller  14:58
think I actually. Me. It might have finally, yeah, we'll open it, yeah, I'll just grab it over here.

Matthias Miller  15:21
Let me move these guys just a little closer together.

Speaker 1  15:23
Okay, yeah, let's, let's look at the other one first. I mean, we'll want to look at this, yeah. So the, so, what we have here is, if we look at the skins first, the the first in the one ending in 743, is an actual stin where we have a a working bill of materials, so you'll see The manufacture price, your standard. Sorry,

Matthias Miller  16:00
it was working.

Unknown Speaker  16:06
Drew, gosh, here we'll see if I can

Matthias Miller  16:14
get it iron out in the meantime. But

Unknown Speaker  16:20
here, okay, this might work. Oh, this is, is

Matthias Miller  16:28
this? Do you guys use libre office or Open Office? Libre? Okay, I downloaded the wrong one. I

Unknown Speaker  16:52
left on download,

Unknown Speaker  16:58
yeah, if you got it there, that'd be good.

Unknown Speaker  17:07
So

Speaker 1  17:09
you able to see that now, yep. So okay, we have the manufacturer price. But the first one is a real building. The next one I just is just a I just added it for the example. So standard cost 38% for standard cost value, 1679 now we're adding full of materials value. So what we're saying there is we have 100 704, that we have actual bill of materials for on that building. So we we subtract that from the 1679 we get our standard cost basis. And then we add and the next one has no bill of materials value, yet, for whatever reason, there's no and that's, that's what we'll have. Then we add the standard cost basis together, 3252 and then if you go up to cell c2 we determine the actual cost in that period. In cost dollars is 3600 and of that 3600 we have 100 and 704, in bill of materials, value that we know are actual bill materials. So that leaves 3492 96 to allocate. And then we have to figure out the actual cost variance percentage. Now there's a bunch of different ways that we could do this math. True if you want to click on that 7.4% or double click on so we can see the so all that we're doing there is we're saying, what do we have left to allocate? And what is our standard cost basis. You have to take the materials out and then divide that by the 3252 so then that we use that percentage. So now if you click on or escape out of that, then click on g9 so so there we're saying, Okay, this number times the 7.4 and then we then to get to the final actual cost. We add cells. We add everything from E to age, which gives us our 3600 right?

Unknown Speaker  19:18
So,

Speaker 1  19:22
okay, does does the logic or the math make sense that we're doing that

Unknown Speaker  19:32
from a

Matthias Miller  19:36
Oh, could I explain it top to bottom without looking at it right now? No. Does it make sense as it stands? Yes. The biggest thing is that currently, the only way we have to exclude something from standard costing is by

Unknown Speaker  19:55
freezing it.

Matthias Miller  19:58
And now what we're saying. Is, well, in addition to that, and or I don't know how freezing applies at this point, but the other way you can do it is by assigning a bomb value, which reduces the basis for

Unknown Speaker  20:22
so basically, the freeze

Matthias Miller  20:29
could what could we get away with? Could we eliminate the freeze check box, and for any place where we had the freeze check box, just set the bomb value to the standard cost? Is

Unknown Speaker  20:40
that? Is that a bad

Matthias Miller  20:43
I guess bomb value only applies to to raw materials. Yeah, so I guess that doesn't really.

Speaker 1  20:52
Is it helpful for you to see where this bomb value comes from or not, and how that Josh has to look at the you may want to open that. You open that skin and go to the I think it's the building sheet.

Matthias Miller  21:12
Builder, builder, bomb sheet.

Speaker 1  21:14
Yeah, I think so it has, it'll actually, it's not, it's not. We don't have a sum total yet, but you should have two values there, 106

Matthias Miller  21:28
the number is 106 or 10704

Speaker 1  21:31
or something, yeah, if you had to do to get Yeah, okay.

Matthias Miller  21:35
So the main thing would be, so, I mean, ideally we put this. We have this visibility under the SKUs. Okay, so let's do this. Let me make some

Unknown Speaker  21:57
notes. Add a um,

Matthias Miller  22:29
uh, I'm going to guess we're going to store. When does the bomb get well, I can't figure that out.

Unknown Speaker  22:50
When it gets frozen?

Matthias Miller  22:51
Yeah, is that unbuilt?

Speaker 1  22:56
Yes, that's the simple answer. But there's, there's other situations that will affect it. One is, we're asking Josh to make so that, and he hasn't built this out yet, but to make so that we can go back in time. And so the thought is, we get to the end of a period, and we say the end of a month, and we say, Oh, our inventory from what we counted and what Bill and Terrell's use is way off. And so we'll say, Oh, we had this one rule wrong. And then there's also the thing of allowing manual entry to be done after it's built. Because the thought is that after it's built, you'll say, oh, we need to add these, you know, these items. So not it not a I mean, the simple answer is, yes, it'll be frozen at the time of build.

Matthias Miller  23:58
But then should the bomb value? I that.

Matthias Miller  24:05
I guess it doesn't matter if the bomb value is dynamically calculated up until the point of freezing actual cost, right?

Speaker 1  24:12
Yeah, and that was the cutoff time we told Josh to use is you can't, you can't make adjustments on buildings that were built before the last actual cost was applied, which is the end of every month.

Unknown Speaker  24:34
Okay, makes sense to me.

Unknown Speaker  24:42
Um, uh, all right, that makes sense.

Speaker 1  24:56
Now, okay. Now, if you go back to the incident. Okay, I made a note there, and I think it's worth looking at the other Okay, so I'm saying the actual end result of doing this will be much the same as what we are doing currently, meaning all of what we just discussed won't fix our issue of we do inventory accounts, we still have. We still end up, if we end up like we do too often, with inventory accounts that we say, well, they're way too high or way too low, well, we'll still end up pushing that back to all the buildings, just, you know, outside of the fixed number, the bombs. So our thought was, and I think this is if you scroll to the so right now, if we're if our inventory is off, we're saying, well, it it looks 50,000 too high. And then we try to dig deeper and figure out what we're asking Josh to do is to do something like this report, where we say, Okay, show us the biggest differences from what Bill of Materials well you've got so if we pick shed time, there OSB, our count says the total we consumed was 25 and the Bill of Materials calculated 24 so We're basically saying one of them was ways so, and for the total in that company, we had five. So we'll have a report that says, here, here are the largest discrepancies per SKU. And using that, I think we'll be able to figure out where the issues are, and also choose to say, Well, yeah, we had a bunch of bad OSB or it, whatever the situation, and write that off to a ways to like, have a call ways to come. What that would do is it would keep our the cost. Apply it to a building relatively stable, and it would, it would make the pain, make us feel a pain immediately on I'm going to say sloppy columns or inaccurate columns. So I don't think there's anything that you need to do with this Matthias, but I thought it's worth mentioning, because when we looked at this, this calculation that we just covered on applying actual costs with a partial bill of material value, just pointed out, you know, that we're not really fixing our issue, which is, so does that make sense? Your

Matthias Miller  27:43
process then is going to be, go pull inventory numbers, go find the story of boots on the ground, what happened with this stuff, and why is it off, and what's the value of waste. And then when you go for calculating actual costs, you're going to take material, you what you're you're gonna, you're gonna create the journal entry for waste, and then you're going to use that difference to apply actual cost, and the rest of the process works the same as it did. That's the thought, yeah,

Speaker 1  28:11
okay, sounds good. So, and I think this that the process we just described on the bill of materials value, what we're going to have starting out is the way Josh is building this is, we're, we're, we're just taking it in pieces. And so one day we'll add bomb rolls for, you know, for this item, and then for the next item. And so it'll that what we're seeing here the $107 of the standard cost of 106 the 1600 is, you know, less than, I don't know what that number is, maybe 5% of the total value or right. And you know that'll go from five to 10 to 20 to 30 to 50 to hopefully about 80% or so, or maybe even 90 so. But I think if we built this correctly, that should all just work, regardless of where we are in the process, right?

Matthias Miller  29:07
And then the only thing that happens is that currently, your per building cost is very muted, for lack of a better term. And as you get the bond rules in, it gets clearer, clearer and more specific and more accurate. Gets you more detail on the individual building costs. Yeah,

Speaker 1  29:31
right now we're just using the same percentage for everyone essentially, and we'll end up with with, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  29:42
good. So this

Speaker 1  29:44
the size of this project. I listed it at the top because it it feels like the most urgent thing we have, or the highest priority thing we have is this. Do you have any feel for size of this? Ah. Uh,

Matthias Miller  30:04
I mean, it seems like it could be half a day to a day, I don't know. Okay,

Speaker 1  30:12
so it's realistic to to have this. I was not this weekend, but have it go live next weekend or not? Yeah,

Matthias Miller  30:20
I think there's a, there's definitely a possibility of that, yeah, yeah, that would

Speaker 1  30:25
be great. That would keep us moving on this whole project. I mean, there's, we still are, but, yeah, good not to files. There's nothing unless, No, there's nothing on that. Do you said it's working fine, and you're still waiting to do the it's in your court to do the training and stuff with truist. So good. Um, positive. Hey, any updates on that? Matthias, yeah,

Matthias Miller  30:55
Seth is out, and I got a hankering, and it's basically done, and it needs his eyes on it to make sure it didn't do anything

Unknown Speaker  31:05
stupid. Okay,

Speaker 1  31:08
so that's kind of the other way around. So if you get him to look at your work exactly,

Speaker 5  31:13
yeah, exactly.

Speaker 1  31:22
So report update upgrades. That's, uh, accounts receivable, report 20, that's, we may want to look at that briefly. This was some request that new house had on AR updates. I don't, I don't think there's anything, I guess I want your approval on it before we go ahead. I think it's pretty straightforward set to do, because it's a standard report. I had sent it to Josh and said, I think this is Seth, but he assigned it to Seth. So obviously,

Speaker 4  32:00
did you send out an agenda mark on it? I didn't. See your agenda. Oh,

Unknown Speaker  32:04
sorry, I didn't. I didn't.

Speaker 4  32:07
You didn't think i You didn't think I was going to be here. What's the standard report?

Speaker 1  32:15
The Incident Number is seven, three, yeah, just go to the incident. I and

Speaker 1  32:27
we'll mostly just be working off of incidents anyway, so we're pretty much, what did you

Unknown Speaker  32:33
say the number was 0673,

Speaker 1  32:42
no. This had to do with affordable wanting to transition to doing their own

Unknown Speaker  32:54
AR. What is it, June? Is

Unknown Speaker  32:59
that the report, did you have linked?

Speaker 1  33:00
There no that's, I'm the report I have linked. There is just a similar report showing what sub pains we want to show.

Speaker 4  33:10
So we're just, what's the report you want to you want to

Speaker 1  33:14
use just the standard accounts receivable report. Oh, gotcha. We're just saying remove what four columns, three or four columns, and add sub panes. Because we looked at and we're like, wow, these sub panes would be nice to have because of nodes and the the columns we're moving really have no value, or we didn't think they did. So if you disagree, let us know before we meet. No,

Speaker 4  33:47
that's that's perfectly fine. It's not even the one we use.

Unknown Speaker  33:53
Okay, good. So, quite straightforward. We are going to hi, hi, sure you can't, please begin, yep. He said,

Speaker 1  34:15
Oh, you're DREW Okay. So we just had something. We just had Dwayne. We just had some surprise business here. Yeah, right, yeah, I never even tried to imagine how you look. Yeah, yes. Recognize any of these guys? Gabe, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  34:33
I know a couple of

Speaker 6  34:40
them looks like a frictionless team. On, on,

Matthias Miller  34:46
we, we got to get through the friction to get to the frictionless. Yeah,

Speaker 6  34:55
yes, sir. So what are you figuring? This looks mean. I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna listen. Oh, yeah. It. We're just doing

Speaker 1  35:00
our weekly, weekly meeting with Matthias and Wayne. So, well, we'll keep going. Man, yeah, well, I'll be back. Okay. So no six the vendor invoice duplication. Notice that there was one thing on that though that we what is the incident number of this? 667,

Matthias Miller  35:33
this is a fun one.

Speaker 1  35:36
I think all that we need Drew and I looked at this, and I think all that we need is documentation with eyes, and maybe you have, if you could put documentation into the wiki so that we don't. I'm

Unknown Speaker  35:48
trying to remember

Unknown Speaker  35:51
the number right out of

Matthias Miller  35:55
Yeah, duplications warning, duplications logic. We determined

Speaker 1  36:01
it's all working just like it should. We don't want to extend or expand the time frame, so the only thing we would like to have is documentation, and maybe you have

Matthias Miller  36:18
it hasn't changed since September 19 of 24 has it?

Unknown Speaker  36:21
I don't think so, but, but,

Unknown Speaker  36:26
yeah, is there documentation?

Matthias Miller  36:31
There's an email. Um, maybe you'd

Unknown Speaker  36:34
send me an email with it, but,

Matthias Miller  36:36
yeah, it's right, like this guy,

Unknown Speaker  36:40
yeah, okay,

Matthias Miller  36:44
duplicate, trans duplicate, transaction logic, vendor invoices, checks and

Speaker 1  36:55
account and all right. I mean, there's nothing internal

Matthias Miller  36:59
entries. I mean, we can easily expand it to five days, if you want five days,

Speaker 1  37:02
pointed out reasons, legit reasons that I hadn't thought of why we wouldn't want to so just documentation is only

Matthias Miller  37:09
Okay. So let's just make sure. What if? What if we make this just if we are on I rule number one,

Unknown Speaker  37:26
if we are on

Matthias Miller  37:30
a check link to a vendor invoice, a transaction link To vendor invoice or the vendor invoice itself, then look for other vendor invoices based on the vendor invoice ID.

Unknown Speaker  37:52
Rule number two,

Matthias Miller  37:58
look for manual transactions and checks not tied to a vendor invoice. Manual check to vendor not tied to a vendor invoice that are plus or minus two days of the transaction date, matching the vendor invoice, The vendor contact, matching the amount rule number three,

Unknown Speaker  38:42
let's

Matthias Miller  38:52
if you guys want, I could get this designed into a pretty poster, and you can hang it on your wall

Speaker 1  39:01
somewhere. No, as long as it's I told drew, I think the problem is, I think Drew and Matthias is probably the only people that know exactly how it works. I ran into a situation where I was talking to Shannon in your office, Dwayne about validation. And so I went, started digging and did some testing, and I uh, yeah, which I mean, for from her, for from her use, all that we need is it's not necessary. I don't think that they necessarily understand the details behind it. It's just as long as it works, that's all we need.

Matthias Miller  39:37
Do you want to add a note? Wait two days, not five days, just for future reference,

Speaker 1  39:42
it'd be good. So Drew go Mingus, um,

Speaker 3  39:47
so the the issue, I think that you ran into mark, was, was like an Amazon thing where I entered it based on payment date and. And they entered it based on the purchase date, I think, yeah, which is going to be a couple days if they delay shipping, sure. But so that's why the attempt to use the five day thing. Part of the reason for not doing five days is stuff that is recurring on a fairly daily basis. You just You get so many more things that calls those duplicates, and Facebook, yeah, yeah, like those.

Speaker 3  40:39
So, I mean, it just broadens what it can call duplicates, mostly

Matthias Miller  40:50
where items are entered on The date of order, ie Amazon, and enter of where vendor invoices are entered on the date, on the order date, but the item is not it's not charged until

Unknown Speaker  41:21
it's shipped,

Matthias Miller  41:24
for example, and Amazon purchases with a delayed ship date.

Unknown Speaker  41:36
All right,

Speaker 3  41:38
I did discover that it does not respect a credit memo as separate from a vendor invoice. So like, if you have a credit memo with the same same number for a vendor as a vendor invoice for that vendor, then it will save their duplicates, which to me, that's perfectly fine. You know, technically they shouldn't be duplicates, but I don't know, because it's worth changing, because generally they won't have the same number. Anyway, i

Unknown Speaker  42:33
How about that? It's kind

Matthias Miller  42:37
of weird, because credit memos are incredible separate records. So why would?

Speaker 3  42:42
Well, I wonder if it doesn't catch them on the, you know, the date, name, amount line, rather than the invoice lot number, that might be what it's doing like if you do the credit memo for the full amount of the vendor index

Matthias Miller  43:04
here. Let's do this. I'm curious. I didn't think the credit memo has a duplicate,

Matthias Miller  43:16
duplicate trends. I

Matthias Miller  43:23
invoice warning duplicate invoice descriptors. If it's a transaction i

Unknown Speaker  43:45
i would have

Speaker 3  43:47
things that I barely had enough data on to build any valid cases to how it works. So sure,

Matthias Miller  43:52
that's fair. It seems weird that you're getting any kind of error at all, but without knowing what it is. It's whatever. It's not worth. It's not even worth the conversation, to be honest. Until, yeah, anyway,

Speaker 1  44:11
good. So there's, I think there's two more things that we have. One is the use tax. And so you just created one for that,

Unknown Speaker  44:21
right? Yeah. Well, I mean, we reopened it.

Speaker 1  44:26
This is not on the list. Matthias, this this since

Unknown Speaker  44:37
zero. It's six by three. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  44:42
Okay, did you see my email reply?

Speaker 3  44:45
Yeah, the one that where you said there's no use tax in first quarter? Yeah. Am I missing something? No, that's correct. I just need the report to pull for the second quarter, and I need to do it. That's what I'm saying. It's not like. Approaches high out, but the high probability of

Matthias Miller  45:06
So you're not seeing, you're not seeing q2, numbers,

Speaker 3  45:14
right? Like there's nothing there, and then an item with use tax does not have any tax history, but it's also not available to create tax history,

Matthias Miller  45:32
I guess. All right, so here is

Unknown Speaker  45:38
we have with a specific or

Unknown Speaker  45:42
Salesforce. A

Matthias Miller  45:45
just go into here I can

Unknown Speaker  45:49
I got rid of it. Let me just pull up that report true.

Matthias Miller  46:01
All right, so here's this guy got invoice sales tax history. It's not creating sales tax history. Rose, you're correct. So sales tax,

Unknown Speaker  46:16
sales tax preview liability. I All

Speaker 7  46:20
right,

Matthias Miller  46:27
let's do Ohio Period. End Date advanced.

Unknown Speaker  46:42
There's the current tax info.

Unknown Speaker  46:51
Let's do this.

Unknown Speaker  47:01
Let's do this. Oh,

Matthias Miller  47:07
okay, why are you not?

Unknown Speaker  47:14
Cal keeps tax.

Unknown Speaker  47:22
I made a made a

Matthias Miller  47:25
total it was state cancelation, a

Unknown Speaker  47:40
so if it is

Matthias Miller  47:46
P list type the current value.

Matthias Miller  47:57
See that? That's the weird thing. Why is that not? I it's

Speaker 5  48:00
not generating any repeating items,

Unknown Speaker  48:20
types per life, Current info. I

Unknown Speaker  48:24
prototypes for

Unknown Speaker  48:41
you see, but you say no contact.

Unknown Speaker  48:58
Treasure, that's what it was. I Yes,

Matthias Miller  49:12
period and date we said here, which I know what it is. Yeah, I lost myself completely Fauci

Matthias Miller  49:49
let's see it would be something like

Unknown Speaker  49:55
prototypes for report i.

Matthias Miller  50:02
Use Tax dates. Count dates we're using what date format date format string so

Unknown Speaker  50:23
yes, that's true.

Unknown Speaker  50:33
All right, so,

Unknown Speaker  50:42
but I it's just

Unknown Speaker  50:43
can't

Matthias Miller  50:48
get enough, get, get, get things going fast enough. All right, so let me try this though,

Speaker 1  50:53
watching this code, I was like when the class said, oh, yeah, yeah, here I add this. Remember this story was, was headed on tip of my tongue to say, Yeah, that's what I thought was,

Matthias Miller  51:05
that's that's what you're thinking.

Speaker 1  51:09
There's this Jay and his boys went up to this Tony La Pratt in Michigan, who's like, if you're in whitetail hunting, he helps you set up your property. And he's very, from what I gather, he's very knowledgeable, but also quite proud of it, or, I don't know, maybe, like he's not bashful about so anyway, he had this, he liked to tell the story about this rock star that he did work for was a Ted Nugent. Is that a name in rock news? I don't know, a big so this guy, this was Tony La Pratt, the white tail expert story. They were out, and so Ted knew everything like he was in he was and finally, Tony said, Look, in the in music, you are the hero in white tail, honey, I am the hero, or I know what I'm doing. Basically said, you know, if you don't want to use me, that's fine, but if you do, then we'll do it like I said, you know, you're going to listen to me and and he wasn't used to be to be talked to like that. And he said, okay, and he's he actually won his trust, according to this was all from Tony's side of the story. And then he said, later on, they were out in the woods, and they came to a place where there was, like a some branches were broken, or a deer had, he pointed out. Said, you know, see this, and it's like, this was a buck this big, you know, because he put his head up here and twisted, you know, it in theory, it could have all made sense, but he really had no idea. He was just trying to really, really impress this guy. Says, like, a 10 point buck with this big of a spread. He went up here and, and, you know, and so, so, Ted said, Yeah, that's what I thought. He tried to blow him away with this, this big theory. Said that's what I thought.

Speaker 1  53:16
He trusted him at some concert. He trusted him to carry his guitars, and his son said, debt never lets anybody touch his guitars. Like, how do you do that?

Matthias Miller  53:32
Wow, all right, well, there's a bug, and I can, I can push a fixed word, I think

Unknown Speaker  53:44
it's not so, right?

Speaker 3  53:46
I mean, no, it's not super urgent, but so it would use the same, the same,

Matthias Miller  53:51
yeah, it's all the same report,

Unknown Speaker  53:54
yeah, okay.

Unknown Speaker  53:56
You need it by

Speaker 3  53:58
or for by June 20, by July 20.

Matthias Miller  54:02
Oh, we'll see if we I don't know. I don't know, that's pushing it. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  54:13
Have you been sold to some bait ERP company?

Unknown Speaker  54:18
Ouch. That's hilarious. We

Matthias Miller  54:24
didn't tell you about that. I

Speaker 1  54:29
don't know, Dwayne, if you've been following the stories or not, the silver loam stories, the six, there's six, six part story of well with last and tell you all about it, because I think you know most all of it.

Unknown Speaker  54:49
I don't think so. I have not No,

Unknown Speaker  54:53
you need to read them. Or I think it's, I

Unknown Speaker  54:55
think, I think I get them. I don't know that I read them.

Unknown Speaker  54:59
This is. Marketing email,

Matthias Miller  55:04
exactly. He's like, I'm already sold on him. What I need to read it I

Unknown Speaker  55:08
have, I have special filters for these type

Unknown Speaker  55:12
Besides, I'm happy with the software I have. So why bother?

Unknown Speaker  55:19
Good. Okay,

Speaker 1  55:22
good. And then there's nothing more on this there. Nope, the last one is just one. Drew, just created, importing new GL accounts, or nuts, or how you call it,

Speaker 3  55:33
IMS GL Account renaming. It's in the middle of the mediums,

Unknown Speaker  55:39
okay, 0675,

Unknown Speaker  55:42
just another. Number.

Speaker 3  55:51
So this is for that rename of the accounts that we were talking about earlier. So that's the current list of the GL account, and I'm wanting a editable report to be able to push over new names. On the left, in the gray is what we want, is an example of what we'll want it to be, and on the right is what it currently is.

Unknown Speaker  56:23
Could we just,

Matthias Miller  56:27
I mean, once you nail this down, I don't know it's up to you, probably just Seth, or I could do an important get it in there and 15 minutes. That sounds great. I don't know if I should offer that or not, but I don't mind giving you an editable report either. Well,

Speaker 3  56:48
main thing is, I just don't I'd rather not open each one, re spell the name, close it, you know, right after not doing so anything else would work.

Speaker 1  57:01
And the timing on it is, is we just need to coordinate that this is done the same time that Aaron does a skew sheet. So as long as we can coordinate a specific nail down a specific time with you Seth, that's

Unknown Speaker  57:16
Yeah, same thing.

Matthias Miller  57:21
Yeah. And this is an Excel file, right? Or spreadsheet. I have one, yeah, or you have one, yeah? I mean, that's mark, unless you see a reason not to.

Speaker 1  57:40
No, I'm fine with that, as long as we caught, I think we're probably about two weeks out on when. Well, what if we I mean, should we just shoot to do this in our well, 528, when he's left?

Unknown Speaker  57:58
It's an excellent

Speaker 1  58:03
just probably look tight, No, as long as we can coordinate a time, which, yeah, it doesn't have to be while on me. I mean, basically all you need is, is an Excel file from us, right? Yeah, and when to update it, and then we'll update sheet on the same at the same time.

Speaker 3  58:22
Um, anything that we leave, we can just leave some inactive and it won't mess up history, right,

Matthias Miller  58:31
like right, we'll just, we'll have the import match on the right hand side and update it to the left hand side. Anything that doesn't match will just stay in the whole whatever who cares format.

Speaker 1  58:43
Okay, is that what you want or don't you want those turned inactive?

Speaker 3  58:46
Well, yeah, anything that's not list I would want to be inactivated.

Matthias Miller  58:51
Oh, we can do that. Okay, that'd be easy.

Speaker 3  58:55
So this list stays active and becomes the list on the left, and everything else is just inactive. Yep,

Speaker 1  59:03
yeah, okay, so you'll need an Excel file some advance. We'll just have to coordinate the time and then go for that.

Matthias Miller  59:11
Yep, one off X 30 match batch on right column, update name to left column. Ignore blank rows. Blank rows, slash header rows, deactivate any unmatched

Unknown Speaker  59:31
accounts.

Matthias Miller  59:37
Important coordinate timing with

Unknown Speaker  59:42
with Mark Drew, or with Mark, Oh, sweet.

Speaker 3  59:50
Okay, should I just um, well, I guess I can discover later. But just send you the. Or send it to the inside support or, like a just

Matthias Miller  1:00:03
drop it in. I mean, if you're done, just attach it in here the Excel file.

Speaker 3  1:00:07
Okay, well, it needs review. But, yeah, we'll just drop them in here. Well, yeah, there would just be one, is this for a safe

Unknown Speaker  1:00:22
Yeah? Yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:00:24
Sounds good. Good.

Speaker 1  1:00:29
Wayne, I think before you were on, we talked about meeting, future meetings,

Speaker 4  1:00:36
yeah, I think I saw, I saw some. I think Matthias sent out a new invite.

Speaker 1  1:00:44
So we have just agreed. We're scheduled to do may 28 June, 12, June, 19, and then none until July, the week of 23rd or we're not doing meetings.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:05
Gotcha, Yep.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:16
Cool, all right,

Matthias Miller  1:01:21
I'm sorry I missed it. What was that?

Speaker 4  1:01:29
Sounds like they froze up, all right?

Unknown Speaker  1:01:38
Well, today, figure out how to get back on how How's pricing coming? Bob stuff? No, for my stuff. Oh, um,

Matthias Miller  1:01:51
we got phase one done. Were you wanting? I'm we talked about you. You want a hand wavy, whole kit and caboodle thing.

Unknown Speaker  1:02:02
I mean, ideally. I mean, well, what's the magic number for phase 100

Matthias Miller  1:02:11
of 160 I need to

Unknown Speaker  1:02:15
go back and look at the phases and see what that included.

Matthias Miller  1:02:19
Accounting system, cash projections.

Speaker 4  1:02:26
Where did we, where did we have? Where did we spec putting portals in, like payment portals,

Matthias Miller  1:02:33
customer, there would be a basic customer payment portal. Manufacturers would log in, not doing the full fledged contract entry. Manufacturers would would log in to to enter contracts.

Unknown Speaker  1:02:58
You said, not the fool, not

Matthias Miller  1:03:00
like a fancy, well, I don't know if we do some kind of fancy, whizzy contract entry thing, whiz bang, whatever.

Speaker 4  1:03:07
Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha. So initially, initially, we would, yeah, okay, got it. So that would be, I need to go back and review phase one. If that's, if that's the numbers we're coming in, I'm gonna, I'm gonna start saying, we're gonna start pulling triggers.

Matthias Miller  1:03:20
Okay, and then it's up to you whether you spend another 12k to flesh out, well, I don't know. I should let Alice give you the final details. So please take these as when you talk to him, you can act stupid, like you don't know anything, but the you can either pay to do a 12 spend 12k to go super in depth and flesh out all the details and remove the variability or risk, or you can ready fire aim. And the other fun thing that you have is, once we get the records in the system, you could actually start building out reporting in a test system with user reports, and we could customize it. And I figured, I told Ellis, I'm like, hoping to Dwayne would have a lot of fun and like, just build out the the menus and the user reports. I mean, we have to do the menus, but build out the user reports, and build out all that stuff, and we just push them into the standard folder. I don't know, except for stuff like projection. I don't know if you want to or not. It's an option, whatever. No, it's

Speaker 4  1:04:16
definitely, it's definitely interesting. The I guess my microphone is not on my headphones. I gotta stay in here. Yeah, I'll just, I'll wait to hear from Ellis. I need it. I'm the we just got back from entree leadership, and sit and talk with a whole bunch of people, and I'm getting antsy to get moving so because I'd really like to have something to fight by September, that would

Unknown Speaker  1:04:47
be really cool.

Matthias Miller  1:04:48
It would be really cool. Yeah, sweet. Well, let me i Ellis wants to be. Just go do the hand weaving price, and I don't want to do the hand waving price, and he's out on graduation stuff, so I'm going to

Speaker 8  1:05:05
you're good at hand waving prices. What are you talking about?

Matthias Miller  1:05:10
Yeah, well, I mean, I don't have any consequences. It's it's egg on his face. If I get it wrong, it's out of your pocket. If it's wrong, like, I don't know, but that's also part of what I hate about like, like, it's not, I'm not holding the bag on anything. I pick up numbers. I mean, I can be a politician,

Unknown Speaker  1:05:30
okay, gut, gut, price on

Matthias Miller  1:05:32
it, I suspect. I mean, I don't. I would be shocked if it's more than half a million. I it.

Matthias Miller  1:05:46
You know, I'm gonna guess it's but it could be three to 400 but I don't know. I need to go back and look, that's very

Unknown Speaker  1:05:57
I don't know.

Speaker 4  1:05:59
So, so I have one concern, and wait, wait, you're recording this. Oh, crap. Here, let's this doesn't need to be on their recording.

Matthias Miller  1:06:12
Well, they don't. They'll, they never get recordings, but we can. I.
