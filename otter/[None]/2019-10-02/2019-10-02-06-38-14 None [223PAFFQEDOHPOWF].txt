Matthias Miller  00:01
So here's some co conscious

Matthias Miller  00:02
recording that I want to do to try to figure some of these things out. I think one of the things to be aware of is kind of this question of what is the problem that we're solving? And maybe even more specifically, how does the finances tie back into fundraising and how they could generate more funds? I think I think there's there could be a couple of angles. One is there could be a consultation around the fact that you how do you identify money is that you know, that's that's maybe just sitting there unused, or that?

Matthias Miller  00:34
What am I trying to say? Like,

Matthias Miller  00:36
maybe there's pockets of money that you that you can try that? Try to identify and try to find?

Matthias Miller  00:42
Maybe it's a conversation starter?

Matthias Miller  00:43
I think, you know, I think early on, we kind of talked about this being a conversation starter

Matthias Miller  00:47
understanding their pain points somewhere.

Matthias Miller  00:50
So maybe that's a possibility.

Matthias Miller  00:55
Maybe there there's a

Matthias Miller  00:58
trying to think what else am I be?

Matthias Miller  01:05
So that's one aspect of it.

Matthias Miller  01:09
The other thing I've been thinking a lot about lately is this whole thing of doing a an assessment on performance and engagement, and using that as a standard

Matthias Miller  01:19
to determine

Matthias Miller  01:20
your organizational efficiency. So

Matthias Miller  01:23
basically, if you're running at, say, 80%, efficiency, we're going to say that's optimal efficiency, that, that you have to be to be realistic, you're never going to actually have

Matthias Miller  01:36
efficiency, that's, that's going to

Matthias Miller  01:38
be 100. Like, that's just not realistic.

Matthias Miller  01:42
So if you currently are at a 60% efficiency rate, that means you're you're 25%, below your capacity. So if you're if your payroll costs,

Matthias Miller  01:58
as an example, are

Matthias Miller  02:03
still, let's say you have 10 employees,

Matthias Miller  02:04
the average salary is

Matthias Miller  02:07
30 K,

Matthias Miller  02:08
that's 300 K a year. And it means that by increasing efficiency and mass, the numbers

Matthias Miller  02:13
wrong here going

Matthias Miller  02:14
the wrong way on these ratios. But if you can increase your efficiency, you could cut that cost by about 25%. So if you cut that cost by about 25%, that's 75 to 75 k budget game.

Matthias Miller  02:30
Now, obviously, you're not going to see that reflected

Matthias Miller  02:32
in the budget. But you're going to see that reflected in, like in the outcomes that your organization achieve.

Matthias Miller  02:47
As a result?

Matthias Miller  02:49
Well, I mean, there are there

Matthias Miller  02:51
are multiple things you could do, you could lay off an employee based off of that. In fact, given this example, you could actually lay off two of your employees for that. If if it really came to that I don't think most people are actually going to be interested in that kind of approach. But it would be it would be a possibility

Matthias Miller  03:10
that they could do.

Matthias Miller  03:14
The The other thing is,

Matthias Miller  03:22
is that suddenly they've increased their capacity without doing any additional fundraising.

Matthias Miller  03:30
And I think that's, that could be a really compelling. That could

Matthias Miller  03:34
be something that's really compelling, really compelling argument, where this type of engagement is.

Matthias Miller  03:46
Yeah, so So, so Okay, but here's here's part of the struggle with this too, is that, it seems to me that the hook to is a whole lot more interesting to say, look, we're going to fundraise more.

Matthias Miller  04:03
Or we're going to

Matthias Miller  04:07
raise more funds with less fundraising. So there's another interesting kind of analytical engagement, which is, which is a lot more complicated than what it looks like on the surface. But it's, it's kind of the at 20. So, but if you could do it at 20 plus at 20. So in other words, you're at 20. donors, Where do

Matthias Miller  04:25
they live? And

Matthias Miller  04:26
where do they come from?

Matthias Miller  04:28
And how do you secure more of them? And one of the things that cater to them? And, and where the places where you find them? And, and so simply by doing more of those activities, and, you know, are there other places that are less profitable. And then once again, and here, here's where the tricky part comes in. Some of those less profitable places may may be lead in to indirectly, you know, contributing to you know, it's good to that become a donor. So, so there's that kind of that that gotcha. And I don't really know how you how you engage that unless you have attendee list that we can actually match and see what's the what's the most had most common pattern of attendance for the top donors. And it's a basically, what you do is you take the attendee list, model them, you, you see what percentage of the top donors, you know, where certain events before they started giving or something along those lines,

Matthias Miller  05:40
maybe an option as that as

Matthias Miller  05:42
another kind of a different angle on this whole thing.

Matthias Miller  05:48
So there's that.

Matthias Miller  05:54
So like I was saying,

Matthias Miller  05:57
being able to, it would be a lot more

Matthias Miller  05:59
interesting to have they

Matthias Miller  06:03
have an offer that says how to cut your fundraising by 25%.

Matthias Miller  06:16
Now, there's a flip side to that, if you were to

Matthias Miller  06:22
increase efficiency,

Matthias Miller  06:28
with increased effectiveness and increase retention,

Matthias Miller  06:33
then you could reduce the cost

Matthias Miller  06:37
of a.

Matthias Miller  06:43
I mean, you can reduce operational

Matthias Miller  06:44
costs significantly. But then you also make it easier to secure new donors, hopefully, because you're running a quality organization. Here's another flip side. Another flip side is what is it that foundations are primarily looking for

Matthias Miller  06:58
financial status nations and or wealthy,

Matthias Miller  07:02
wealthy individuals are primarily looking for

Matthias Miller  07:04
and when contributing to a nonprofit organization,

Matthias Miller  07:10
are they looking for?

Matthias Miller  07:14
Are they looking for

Matthias Miller  07:17
excellence in

Matthias Miller  07:19
math management?

Matthias Miller  07:20
Are they looking for, you know, causes they care about? Obviously, there's probably going to be something, it's probably certainly Italy, it has to be something that they care about.

Matthias Miller  07:32
So maybe it's there's

Matthias Miller  07:33
also this question of what are

Matthias Miller  07:34
the types of things that they care about next? That could be another interesting question. But then there is this question of, you know, what is?

Matthias Miller  07:45
Does does excellence and sustainability

Matthias Miller  07:48
matter to the matter significantly to them?

Matthias Miller  07:56
I think for me,

Matthias Miller  08:03
I mean, honest, unbiased

Matthias Miller  08:04
metrics could be could be an interesting side of this, though, because of your $50. You specifically, were able to help

Matthias Miller  08:13
help this. Alright, so this goes

Matthias Miller  08:14
down this other this other rabbit, rabbit hole. One of the things Lauren was talking about was donor centric, giving

Matthias Miller  08:25
that

Matthias Miller  08:26
that as an organization, when you're relating to a donor, then you are relating to a donor centric,

Matthias Miller  08:41
donor centric

Matthias Miller  08:44
model. So

Matthias Miller  08:48
So with that,

Matthias Miller  08:55
what where were we going with all of that?

Matthias Miller  09:02
I'm not quite sure where to go with all that. I think I think it's something important to consider in that, but

Matthias Miller  09:09
there's yet this other angle.

Matthias Miller  09:12
I think part of the challenges, there's so many different angles to go from. So which one has the highest return on investment? for them? So if you had if you were in an order to here's another way to ask the question, if I were an organization with a limited budget, and I needed to change the financial situation,

Matthias Miller  09:38
where would I start?

Matthias Miller  09:41
Well, that's a good question.

Matthias Miller  09:56
I think one of the things I would ideally do first, is I would,

Matthias Miller  10:06
I would look to free up my time.

Matthias Miller  10:12
I don't know, you know, one of the

Matthias Miller  10:14
things that's huge in my mind right now is this whole thing of orchestrating teams and getting teams is built into a place where they thrive and succeed, and where the people who are, who are in place on the team are able to effectively manage the outcomes. That's a huge deal to me.

Matthias Miller  10:36
So probably,

Matthias Miller  10:39
I think it kind of depends whether

Matthias Miller  10:40
we're on the survival standpoint, or you know,

Matthias Miller  10:42
whether you know, how much breathing room can we have, can we step into the operations, it can kind of keep going without completely

Matthias Miller  10:49
demolishing the organization. So that could

Matthias Miller  10:55
that could be another aspect of the of the assessment is just simply this that how bad is your name, and, you know, how soon before you

Matthias Miller  11:07
before you got a

Matthias Miller  11:10
big, we gotta do something.

Matthias Miller  11:20
Alright, so let's look at it, it's like this.

Matthias Miller  11:24
You don't get funding, nothing else happens. So that's clearly an issue.

Matthias Miller  11:33
This whole thing

Matthias Miller  11:34
starts with the mindset, that same mindset shift of Where's look at where you are now. And let's paint a clear picture of the organization that you want to become.

Matthias Miller  11:49
So what you want to what you want

Matthias Miller  11:50
now, what you have now is, it's you're running a tight ship, you want to have some breathing room in your budget.

Matthias Miller  11:58
And you want to, you want

Matthias Miller  12:05
to be you want your team to be operating with excellence. So there's the piece.

Matthias Miller  12:12
Looking at all of that, given the

Matthias Miller  12:14
current situation, what is the simplest piece that you can peel off to make that change, to move over into that spectrum?

Matthias Miller  12:25
And I think that

Matthias Miller  12:26
answer could actually vary from organization to organization. Maybe one of the simplest things is,

Matthias Miller  12:34
sorry, yours yet another random idea.

Matthias Miller  12:37
Something that we could very, very well do

Matthias Miller  12:39
is kind of an asked method for donors. And we would we would ask the donors, why they give to the organization, you identify the top donors, ask them why they give.

Matthias Miller  12:53
And ask them what their biggest frustration has been

Matthias Miller  12:55
about giving to organizations. There you go.

Matthias Miller  12:57
That in itself is one a lot. So it's a combination of a few different things. It's, it's the

Matthias Miller  13:13
it's the Ask method plus the 8020 plus RSM.

Matthias Miller  13:18
In reality, so if you could score donors on the FM to find find the best donors, and then you

Matthias Miller  13:34
and then you follow up with them. And that that's, that's a really interesting idea.

Matthias Miller  13:54
The point in getting information is that you only want to get so much information as you need in order to make an intelligent decision. Any information beyond that is ends up being a waste. And I mean, it's just not necessary, it ends up becoming a distraction, is it becoming the ability so.

Matthias Miller  14:18
And in fact, even in that whole

Matthias Miller  14:19
thing, you only want to make a decision that, that gives you at most an 80% probability of being right.

Matthias Miller  14:28
And certainly,

Matthias Miller  14:29
if you can prove that this isn't going to take you in the wrong direction, like by all means, if you have two choices, and you have a 60% likelihood that one of them is is the right one to move ahead with now, and neither one of them will be will, will actively be will be detrimental to the organization.

Matthias Miller  14:47
And it may just be that one's a slightly

Matthias Miller  14:48
better approach than the other. And by

Matthias Miller  14:50
all means 60% certainty is great enough certainty, to know which which

Matthias Miller  14:55
direction to go.

Matthias Miller  15:23
So if you were to engage

Matthias Miller  15:29
in that, and if you were to tailor

Matthias Miller  15:33
your conversation to your donors in this way. Imagine what would change in their response responsiveness to their ass?

Matthias Miller  16:25
You're a few examples that you could use with the donor stuff. Why do you give the first reason is I give because I care about the cause. The second of all i give because just the excellence with which you run the organization, and I feel like like, this is the most effective use of my dollar. Another one is I give

Matthias Miller  16:45
because of a personal contact. And it really could

Matthias Miller  16:46
be because of anybody within the organization, it could be, it could be the end, it could be a board member, it could be something like that,

Matthias Miller  16:54
you know, read some situations, it could be because of member benefits.

Matthias Miller  16:59
But it would actually be really fascinating to do this on the you know, say on the FCC board, or something like that, and just figure out kind of where people are at on that. The fascinating thing is that you can actually use this method then to, to wait with volunteers, and with your staff members. Because in reality, you're going to need different messaging with different ones of your staff

Matthias Miller  17:36
members. And so, so understanding

Matthias Miller  17:39
the reason that they're there, and what brought them to the job is going to be hugely significant. And understanding how you relate to that, and how you articulate the value of their work. And like this is a super, super fascinating exercise really fascinating. Because you're taking the Ask method again, you're applying it in a non conventional

Matthias Miller  18:03
context, but still in the context of influence

Matthias Miller  18:06
and persuasion.
