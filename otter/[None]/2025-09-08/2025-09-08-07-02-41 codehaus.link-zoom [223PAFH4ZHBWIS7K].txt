Matthias Miller  00:23
Hey, Bob, Hey, morning,

Unknown Speaker  00:28
you're out.

Speaker 1  00:30
How's it? You can't hear me. Can't hear you. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  00:42
All right, can you hear me now? How about now?

Unknown Speaker  00:50
Are you sure?

Unknown Speaker  01:02
Hmm,

Speaker 1  01:12
still there, yep, I'm still here. Can you hear me? Can't hear you. Check your check your phone.

Unknown Speaker  01:18
Oh, hang on. Maybe it's me down. I'm sorry. All good. There we go. I'm gonna

Speaker 1  01:27
try putting these back in. All right,

Unknown Speaker  01:32
my bad.

Unknown Speaker  01:38
Check. There we go. I still here,

Unknown Speaker  01:41
you're good. Alright, where do we go?

Matthias Miller  01:52
I mean, let's pull up the well, share your screen and let's jump into Silver limb. All right,

Speaker 1  02:02
we'll There we go.

Speaker 2  02:19
That I'm so

Unknown Speaker  02:34
we've been we've been going, um,

Unknown Speaker  02:39
I'll sorry if I tell you what I've been

Speaker 3  02:40
doing. Perfect processes.

Unknown Speaker  02:45
So

Speaker 3  02:48
John, on his trucking schedule, has every load he's attaching. So if I get this right here, no hair every load he attaches. Shoot. There we go. Well, I don't know if you can see that well or not. Anyway, savan International Paper, there's the size hte treated, there's a quantity, and then he puts the sage order number on that.

Speaker 2  03:16
Yep. Okay, so it's

Speaker 3  03:19
burger, for example. Right here. Oh, 3.5 issues, lot of issues. So we've been going what we're having to do. It's because he done every entry he's done. It's not a tied it to the correct sales order number,

Unknown Speaker  03:40
cement, automatic

Speaker 3  03:41
stuff happening, and he seems to, anyway, these same excuses sometimes gets old. But so what I've been what we've been doing like, so now I'm going through my the schedules. I have all of the August ones, and anyway, going through one day at a time, and every load of burger finding the quantity in the sales order. And

Speaker 3  04:14
so here's all those 3.5 so I'll go to we reconcile everything in was it? Everything that was assembled in July.

Unknown Speaker  04:28
You know, that was it?

Unknown Speaker  04:32
Trying to look here, I have to go back and look at this. I

Speaker 3  04:45
um, I'm gonna stop right now. 161 and 23 that was a load date. The 153 and the 161 I'm thinking that was all tied out. He had that anyway. I'm just working backwards. 679985, yeah, we finished that.

Speaker 3  05:16
So I got a sage order number. So, yeah, there's the 161 this guy was, yeah, we worked backwards on this. Anyways, that's clean up. So now I gotta go back to 79986,

Speaker 3  05:42
that's my next one. It's like one load at a time. So here we go. So he's got 731 and then he's Oh, he said, Osmond doesn't always put the right numbers down on quantities. Yeah. He said, That's Osmond there. So then we had to correct the quantity. Well, anyway, so he's putting in wrong quantities sometimes. Apparently he doesn't have a way of double checking in these guys's quantities, which is sad. So this was, yeah, 731 July 31 end of the day, Randall 430. Did 104 79986, I'm gonna go back. 8696,

Speaker 3  06:36
did seven o'clock to 11. They did 80. And they all got assigned to this guy.

Unknown Speaker  06:45
So

Speaker 3  06:52
some of them should have been anyway, you know, if you get it, you know what I'm trying to I'm wasting your time right now.

Unknown Speaker  06:59
Maybe no less fried. I mean, is this, are we

Matthias Miller  07:03
down to the point of, all right, what's that, Matt, are we down to the point of just manually going through everything, or is there anything we

Speaker 3  07:14
can No, that's, that's what. I guess that's why Sharon is, hang on, let me shut off this air conditioner. Yeah, all right, that's better.

Unknown Speaker  07:29
I think the only thing

Speaker 3  07:34
probably, I mean, I don't know how to speed it up. Yeah, I don't know how to speed it up the way. It makes it less this particular scenario where, like, you know, there's just a pile of entries that are goofed up because

Speaker 4  07:55
they continue to add wrong quantities on top of each other. I'm not sure how to speed that up. There's no

Speaker 3  08:01
unless, I don't know, unless there was, like, it back here, yeah, I don't even know. I mean, here's the silver loom number, but it's, gosh, it's so

Speaker 4  08:19
I mean, potentially it'd be worth it to if this is going to continue to be an

Unknown Speaker  08:23
issue, like, to be able to,

Speaker 4  08:27
like, reconcile right here on this page, like, draw a line from here to here and say

Speaker 3  08:34
it's, I don't know. It's just, you know, like, this should be here, and I don't know,

Matthias Miller  08:42
like, what if, what if you would have

Unknown Speaker  08:49
um here, have an idea.

Matthias Miller  08:54
I mean, like, what if, what if this thing here instead of um,

Matthias Miller  09:12
uh, what did? This would show the sales order numbers that it's tied out to, instead of the employees,

Unknown Speaker  09:19
instead of employees, yeah,

Speaker 3  09:26
yeah, I mean,

Unknown Speaker  09:34
Like, if I could now, okay, so

Speaker 3  09:42
I don't know. Matt, like the 104 is with the right one, the 80 is not so

Speaker 4  09:50
my, you know? Like I still have to go, No, I don't know, because now I have to say, okay, 100 Wait, 80 and 104 that is the correct so. So that's right, this is actually right. He has this correct 79986, so wait a minute. Let me okay, let me go back.

Unknown Speaker  10:10
So I'm gonna go sorry.

Unknown Speaker  10:16
I thought we were goofed up there. We weren't so, so that was right,

Speaker 3  10:25
104 and 80. Here's another 80 and 104 that looks like it's correct. That should have a trucking schedule, trucking schedule. I mean, I'm just let me walk through this to see if there's a quicker way.

Unknown Speaker  10:50
Yeah, if I would know, if I would have,

Unknown Speaker  10:54
I don't know, potentially having all the sage orders, whether they're filled or not,

Unknown Speaker  11:00
not necessarily,

Matthias Miller  11:04
okay, I would see two things that could potentially be useful. One is, here, let me I'm going to take over your screen share and show you something here, guys, to give you a visual.

Unknown Speaker  11:22
You 00,

Matthias Miller  11:26
you want to switch over to zoom.

Unknown Speaker  11:29
What's that? If you want to switch over to

Speaker 4  11:32
zoom, run a machine on the other side of the wall

Unknown Speaker  11:35
here. That's stinks.

Unknown Speaker  11:39
I can speak up,

Matthias Miller  11:42
yeah. Are you able to see this?

Unknown Speaker  11:46
I can see it, yeah.

Matthias Miller  11:48
So, I mean, imagine if instead of the employee columns like this shows, maybe you just want the sage. I guess you don't really need the the row ID just

Unknown Speaker  11:59
is that showing the one that it

Speaker 3  12:02
was tied to? Yeah, that helps. But could I still have the employees and that just add that?

Matthias Miller  12:12
What happens if, how do you want to show multiple employee? I mean, you're not going to have the same count of

Unknown Speaker  12:20
again. Sorry, what's that?

Matthias Miller  12:24
Yeah, I mean we can, yeah,

Matthias Miller  12:36
Let's actually do This. Um,

Unknown Speaker  13:21
themselves,

Unknown Speaker  14:41
it's Matt, holler at me when you're when you're, Can I do anything in it right now?

Speaker 1  14:59
Yeah, yeah. Here. Okay, oh, holler, I'm gonna

Unknown Speaker  15:01
keep rolling on this side of

Matthias Miller  15:05
the do you want to, do you want to show just the sage order? Do you want to show the full row number, like the sage order

Unknown Speaker  15:17
and row number?

Unknown Speaker  15:20
Row number. Sorry,

Matthias Miller  15:23
we got the row nine, four, or also have the 000001, on the end.

Speaker 3  15:33
Oh, I don't need the 00 thing. What's the 00 number come from?

Matthias Miller  15:39
It's, it's based on the line item inside of the order,

Speaker 3  15:44
meaning that the first second or third entry of that is that what that means?

Matthias Miller  15:52
Yeah, so like, if you've got a biggest thing would be if you've got multiple line items for the same item for some reason, which isn't likely to happen, but we still need to account for it. Yeah, I

Unknown Speaker  16:02
mean, it could, I guess

Unknown Speaker  16:04
it could be helpful.

Speaker 4  16:07
The row ID, could it just be a well? Could it be a dash then the number? Or does it need to

Unknown Speaker  16:17
be? No, we can do that. Um,

Unknown Speaker  16:25
yeah, that could be half open. And

Unknown Speaker  16:56
it so happy to write and get

Unknown Speaker  17:16
he had something wrong. The source I was in that's not what I

Matthias Miller  18:17
do you want to show the total, the order quantity and the quantity needed and the quantity assembled for each one.

Unknown Speaker  18:30
Yeah, I like those three. Those three numbers are helpful. I mean, everything else on there is helpful. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  18:46
So here is key for,

Unknown Speaker  18:59
Oh, my word.

Unknown Speaker  19:10
Here, this is, are

Unknown Speaker  19:14
you on the same screen as I'm on?

Matthias Miller  19:18
No, I took over when I just a minute ago. Let me okay, if you want to jump back to my screen. Uh, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  19:36
oh, I got problems, man,

Speaker 2  19:40
23456, nothing. 13,

Unknown Speaker  19:48
how,

Speaker 3  19:51
yeah, sorry, I'm coming back. Yeah, I'm with you, Matt,

Unknown Speaker  19:56
something like that.

Unknown Speaker  19:59
So I. D

Unknown Speaker  20:07
time, sure,

Unknown Speaker  20:10
yeah, that's fine.

Unknown Speaker  20:14
Oh yeah, do we still need all the zeros in there?

Unknown Speaker  20:19
I guess potentially a,

Matthias Miller  20:23
we don't know. Well, I mean, we don't have to 110, or,

Speaker 3  20:34
yeah, just a simple thing. But yeah, it should be fine.

Matthias Miller  20:41
Um, do you care as far as, do you want to? Do you want to? I mean, can this take the place? Is this going to be an issue for John, like, Should customer item be further left anywhere?

Unknown Speaker  20:55
Yeah, I can't hardly hear you. I'm sorry. Man, I Is there any,

Unknown Speaker  20:59
yeah, should, should let me Sorry,

Matthias Miller  21:05
just I close my door so nobody else mind me hollering. I don't I can holler.

Speaker 4  21:10
I'm just not getting a lot of audio mine. I I should probably have a try Bluetooth, but that messed you up too, already, man, that thing

Unknown Speaker  21:18
is loud. Holy cow, actually, why don't I? Why don't I step away and go to my home office?

Speaker 3  21:34
Then we can really, yeah, okay. Is that alright? It'd be like five minutes.

Matthias Miller  21:40
Yeah, that's perfect, man.

Speaker 4  21:42
Can we do Hey here on the total time, assembly time? Can those be left,

Unknown Speaker  21:48
left of the cell?

Unknown Speaker  21:50
Yeah. And then

Speaker 3  21:54
we do like, only one, zero on that, on that sage order number? Yeah. Then we could go up to 99 right?

Unknown Speaker  22:06
Well, we'll just,

Matthias Miller  22:08
we'll just, I mean, we'll let it, yeah, we'll make sure it's at least two digits, and we'll let it go more if it needs more.

Speaker 4  22:15
Let's do center on the on the total time. Let's do center all right.

Unknown Speaker  22:22
That'll be what total time and assembly time could be centered.

Speaker 4  22:29
Alright, I'm gonna, yeah, I'm gonna hang up and or, yeah, I'm gonna, I'll call, should I call you back on Zoom?

Matthias Miller  22:37
Yeah, maybe easiest, so we can screenshot just thank you again. Thank you.

Unknown Speaker  36:42
Three Hey, can you hear me, Matt,

Speaker 4  36:46
now you're muted. Hey, I can hear you. Thanks. All right. All right. Sorry. Where were we at?

Matthias Miller  36:59
We were I was looking I was working on the new version of the report,

Unknown Speaker  37:04
yeah,

Unknown Speaker  37:06
yup, yup, and good deal, alright,

Unknown Speaker  37:12
alright. I got privacy now.

Unknown Speaker  37:13
Better. Better than ever.

Unknown Speaker  37:16
Better than ever. Little girls run

Speaker 4  37:19
through and create some noise might happen.

Unknown Speaker  37:30
All right, well,

Matthias Miller  37:38
I guess what's so. So so this report can definitely help,

Unknown Speaker  37:45
yeah, for these changes,

Matthias Miller  37:50
is there, are there other things like, are there other things that would be useful? Yeah?

Speaker 4  38:02
I'm sure. Well, man, I don't know, sorry, um, so, okay, let me well, I'm looking at something right now. If you see I

Speaker 4  38:24
you hear this, huh? Hours in one day. It's probably double entry. That's ju that's may here he has 19.75 hours.

Unknown Speaker  38:38
Oh, yeah, it's grouped down by employee,

Unknown Speaker  38:42
yeah, yeah, here he has night.

Matthias Miller  38:46
Sorry, it's either that or one of these should be the 25th or the what days are those?

Speaker 4  39:01
Yeah, I know, yeah, I know it's, it's a variety. Well, here's

Unknown Speaker  39:10
sorry, this

Speaker 4  39:14
is July. I don't I need to pull up a calendar to see 29 that's the 30th. Well, don't know without looking at it, you know what? I mean, it's probably

Matthias Miller  39:30
it. It's the eight is above the five on the keypad.

Unknown Speaker  39:38
What's that?

Matthias Miller  39:40
I mean, like the eight on the on the number pad, the eights directly above the

Unknown Speaker  39:44
five. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  39:49
and I, I saw similar patterns in the,

Unknown Speaker  39:54
I don't know, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  40:02
Hmm, what?

Speaker 4  40:07
Put on your map, put on your owner hat. Like, dude, I'm serious. I'm like, if you're the owner, if you me, are owning this business, what's the right thing to do, in your opinion?

Matthias Miller  40:18
Okay, well, the right, okay, first of all, question number one is, why is he not accurate? And there's multiple answers to that. Number one, not everybody has the same proclivity to accuracy, and so I would say, and it doesn't mean that they can't that they can't be accurate. It's means they have limited energy for being accurate. And I would, I would take a look and see if he's the, I mean, the Colby index is what I'm most familiar with. But, but But is he the Is he the fixed problems as they show up, or does? Is he the fixed problems before they show up? And is he the jump from one thing, one thing to the next? Or is he follow things through to completion? And I would look at other I would look at the easiest way is probably patterns of behavior. Does he how does how does he interact with the world? So that's question number one. Question number two is an emotional question, is he bought in, and does he have something to gain or lose? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  41:57
thank you. Um, I, um,

Speaker 4  42:03
is he bought in? I mean, he's he doesn't know what else to do, and there's a lot of pride involved, and it's his identity. And now he gets self worth from from the job.

Unknown Speaker  42:20
Um, what is this job,

Speaker 4  42:25
assembly supervisor, but he likes being on the forklift. It needs to there. It needs to change. Like his whole, the whole thing of his, his responsibilities need to be adjusted. And so this is potentially a step in in that yeah, this should be a step in the right direction for his his contribution to the company to be Yeah, if it's not his skill set, if he's not proficient at accuracy of data entry, then simply, somebody else needs to do it right.

Matthias Miller  43:11
And I think, I think that the one thing you know, if you want to translate so that's all, how would I think about it? And then if you want to translate that into what to do. I think a pretty interesting thing to do is, is pose it to him something like this. I'm wondering if this is, if this data entry is partially a production function and partially an assembly function. And I want you to get with Amanda every day to put this stuff in. And she's going to make sure that everything gets done right. I's are dotted, t's are crossed. He's going to make sure that, and hopefully she's going to hold his feet to the fire that with the numbers he's giving her from the production side is actually correct. He's got production context, and it feels a little bit like babysitting. But nobody in nobody on the on the admin or account or the admin or finance side has the same level of visibility into the day to day that he would have. And so maybe it actually could end up being a good thing. The other thing I would do, I would say, is, if Amanda, which I mean, I'm just picking her because you've mentioned her in the past, I don't know that she's the right person, but, but if Amanda has capacity to do historical cleanup, you're going to have way you're going to have way less headache working with somebody like if you can find somebody who's naturally a little bit more gifted down these lines, it's going to bring up a load of responsibility off your shoulder

Speaker 4  44:49
again. Hang on, hang on. I lost you. I lost you for a second. Let me look at I don't know why I have good internet. Wait, saying it's unstable. It should not be. Unstable. Hang on here. Let me check somewhere. No or I should be good on it. I don't know why it froze up. So you said, If a man has capacity to do historical cleanup, then you What do you say after that?

Matthias Miller  45:14
Well, I mean, if she you're gonna have, you have enough things weighing on you right now, if you can have somebody who's actually good at this stuff, yeah, and isn't gonna be throwing wrenches and gears all the time and just shows up and get it, gets it done, that would be, in my opinion, a huge load off your shoulders, and you can trust that it's actually going to get done, right? And you can also show her reports like this and say, Look, there's no way anybody's working 812, hours a day, 13 hours a day. Go, go check with go check with John, and get John to help you straighten out these numbers.

Speaker 1  45:56
Yeah, if you want to go that deep,

Unknown Speaker  46:05
what do you think?

Matthias Miller  46:07
Love it, hate it, disagree,

Speaker 4  46:09
no, I mean, it's, I think I'm trying to that's painful one, yeah, somebody's got to do it. That knows that can do it. I can also know that what like with, yeah, anyway, oh, I'm just thinking of personalities, and Amanda's personality, and I've tried, uh, it's, she's gonna have to try it, um, or Tina's gonna have to try it. But Tina's been made a lot of mistakes in the past on data entry, when we did Excel stuff when we were doing data entry with that, and so that was an issue. I'm, yeah, I'm not real excited about the team right now, to be honest with you, Matt, that's what I'm thinking so the but I am looking on a bookkeeper, job description and average salary in Pennsylvania, so 50k a year, accounts payable, accounts receivable, all your financial stuff can be taken care of. And I was just thinking how much money I could save by replacing one person, and then I could hire a really good person to do HR and get involved with some other things. Future general manager could do HR could do this stuff. I don't know anyways, where I get a good bookkeeper that could do this stuff plus bookkeeping, right?

Speaker 1  47:41
Yeah, you, you're,

Unknown Speaker  47:47
you're carrying

Matthias Miller  47:50
the personnel debt and the conflict management debt of your dad, keeping people on staff that were not that's what I

Speaker 4  47:59
need. Email that I sent, sorry, sorry, you glitched again. Matt, what'd you say?

Matthias Miller  48:04
I said you're you're carrying the debt of conflict avoidance and personnel toleration from your dad, effectively.

Unknown Speaker  48:15
Yeah, um, I'm not

Matthias Miller  48:20
saying he didn't do the best he knew. I'm just saying that's part of the that's part of the

Speaker 4  48:25
Yeah, that's Yeah, that's right, it's true. So I have to, I have to deal with it, um, um, yeah. I have to find the right person, people. I mean, I am active with that. I have a guy come this afternoon, two o'clock. I have a guy that I met anyway, potential. But if Matt, if we look at that email I sent you, I'm not trying to pick on you or whatever. Seriously. Ah, just what did I write on there? I said, I don't know what you you said you had some thoughts, or, like, as far as you coming on site or getting involved in somehow, in a greater way, what? What are your thoughts? There Any, any chance. I mean, I'm

Matthias Miller  49:26
coming on site for a few days here, or coming on on site periodically, I'm open to, I'm open to figuring that. I mean, I'm open to taking a look at that. I don't know what that should look like.

Speaker 2  49:40
Um, I

Matthias Miller  49:43
just, I hate, I hate how much time travel eats up going back east,

Speaker 4  49:52
yeah, it is, is a is a period of time? Is there a nugget or a capsule of time? Here? Year, any possibility for you?

Matthias Miller  50:05
Like, okay, but what time frame are you thinking a day a week, a month a year?

Speaker 4  50:10
I mean, I'm thinking of more like a week to a month where we could and I'm saying like, company, clean up. Like, 101, like, just dive in. I'm making changes on the personnel side. You're on site, you're available to bridge things, because what then needs to happen is we need to get away from Sage eventually and like it all needs to go on one platform. Yeah, so, I mean, seriously, I'm like, why not? Right? Might as well do. I mean that would make

Unknown Speaker  50:52
maybe that's, I'm not trying to be everything doesn't have to happen in one time, right? Maybe that's too

Speaker 2  51:01
um, thinking,

Speaker 4  51:13
talking or not right now, Matt, you're back. Hey, can we talk on the cell phone and still continue to zoom that way, yeah, let's do that. Okay, I'm gonna call you. All right. Let me get my Bluetooth here. All right, sounds good.
