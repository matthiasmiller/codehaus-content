Unknown Speaker  01:28
Good morning marks

Speaker 1  01:42
few updates from us your general ledger drilling issues should be fixed through drilling from there, and I believe your asset management changes should be live

Unknown Speaker  02:04
there a little bit. So

Speaker 1  02:13
I've been working on sales order, sales order accounting impact, but that's still underway and it's going to require some additional conversations with Dwayne to figure out how we want to Well I think we are we handle when I handle the deposit process? I guess is that gonna be handled by Dwayne's? Well, good, who's going to be doing like the actual process of natural deposits and handling those in AR? Well,

Speaker 2  02:55
Dwayne's office is going to be updating what deposited but I don't think it's, it should probably be a joint conversation. Dwayne and Drew and I don't know, should we? Is that something we should cover at one today?

Unknown Speaker  03:16
Yeah

Unknown Speaker  03:24
let me see if he'd be available. And if so, yes, that'd be great. I think that's all I've got on my list. I mean, things are basically on track there's increasing number of things that are important to design and nail down some of those require excuse me collaboration

Unknown Speaker  03:50
Yeah.

Speaker 2  03:57
So we'll go ahead through with our asset management. Yeah.

Speaker 3  04:03
So in the asset management, there's a few things we came up with the in the accounting section there for the depreciation expense account and the accumulated depreciation account. The expense account is still not giving us the options to put it in the asset section under like FDI or any of those. Okay, because it should be expensed to FDI so we now can select account but we can only select from either while they're all expense account some of our cost of goods and some

Unknown Speaker  04:43
of our expenses.

Speaker 3  04:48
So, so those knees allowed the asset accounting allowed under that and then accumulated depreciation on That's fine as far as the accounts available. But there should only be like, you can allocate different percentages to different expense accounts. There should only be one accumulated depreciation account option. Like you shouldn't be able to split the accumulated depreciation because that needs to match the account that it's in. As far as the assets it's in. So like, if the asset is a rolling stock asset, then the accumulated depreciation needs to go in the rolling stock depreciation account, you can split it, then you're having accumulated depreciation against some other asset.

Speaker 1  05:50
So, just changing that to a single field would do the trick. Probably.

Speaker 3  06:04
Like just just put the accumulated depreciation account selection box just in a totally separate thing from that allocation box thing.

Unknown Speaker  06:15
Yeah, who worked there?

Speaker 3  06:19
And then, so if it's a partially you went over this last week, but if it's a partially depreciated asset? Oh, are we making a regular transaction? Or maybe we should just run through that, that transaction that's we just make regular transaction and attach the data to the ID number of this asset? Or are we doing Yeah, I

Speaker 1  06:48
think what you need to do is have the original purchase have a have a transaction for the original purchase and then have a prior to the service date, and then have it debits and you know, whatever transaction you need to get the depreciate depreciation expense accounts and the accumulated depreciation depreciation account at the right levels on the I'm gonna assume the month before you're ready to start using it now and it should work it's a little complicated

Speaker 2  07:39
Would you mind walking us through that example? Again? Just it looked easy enough then but we probably we could just use the same

Unknown Speaker  07:53
use the same one?

Unknown Speaker  07:54
Yeah, that we had use

Unknown Speaker  08:00
like that Bird's Mouth notch or I think was one.

Unknown Speaker  08:04
That's right. Okay, so go

Speaker 3  08:16
Oh, you're doing this through 2034 thing.

Unknown Speaker  08:22
Just defaulting to it

Unknown Speaker  08:25
did the same thing for us Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  08:33
Okay, so.

Unknown Speaker  08:48
It was that all those voids in ones

Unknown Speaker  08:57
is the top transaction there's the one you want.

Speaker 1  09:00
Okay, give me a second. Let me send this over to you read it sincerely, Joel.

Speaker 2  09:07
So all these voided ones are the changes that are from what the update Jeff made to AP right. This morning, he said we that we that goes we shouldn't see those white transactions. I'm assuming those are from the change he made to AP.

Speaker 1  09:30
Yeah, I'm gonna assume it's something like this. Okay. Here's the actual asset transaction. So here's where here's where we have the where we have that and then we would have a so if if we're looking to

Speaker 1  10:00
What's the what is the what's the as of date that you want to start depreciating depreciating

Speaker 2  10:15
one 124. Now when does when does the depreciation expense apply does that first day of the month last day of the month I don't know that that does that make a difference

Unknown Speaker  10:41
monthly depreciation

Unknown Speaker  10:55
birthday day as

Unknown Speaker  11:01
the ID

Unknown Speaker  11:13
we're going to continue with us

Unknown Speaker  11:38
this one doesn't have an allocation percentage okay so let's do 100% allocated to we have something for

Speaker 3  11:50
verses you can't Yeah that's one we can't do but you can just do oh it really doesn't matter. Production yeah supplies sounds good

Unknown Speaker  12:12
action

Unknown Speaker  12:16
No, that's

Unknown Speaker  12:18
yeah

Unknown Speaker  12:20
yeah, that's right

Speaker 1  12:27
so yes, it looks like it's trying to apply from the first of the month. Currently, it's 720 because it doesn't see any depreciation taking since the beginning of the year. So what we would do then is have a beat well, we're gonna let's change this as of date to January 1 Wait for it as it stands, it wants to do 1200 A month but that's not correct. So what we're going to do instead is as a 1231. We would have a owner's equity or we're what's the

Unknown Speaker  13:14
Yeah, yeah. And the owner's equity

Speaker 1  13:23
they have six months left six point 6.5 times or it's 7200 divided by seven times six well

Unknown Speaker  13:45
I'm sorry

Unknown Speaker  13:51
I don't work for this.

Unknown Speaker  13:54
Okay. So this is a

Unknown Speaker  14:02
which we say business need to go on?

Unknown Speaker  14:06
Yeah, that's right. Because no that's it. Yeah. equity.

Unknown Speaker  14:18
Equity means equity would go

Unknown Speaker  14:20
we're increasing equity. Yes. So yeah, that's backwards

Speaker 1  14:34
I think this one needs to be under the Yeah. Okay. And then your

Unknown Speaker  14:49
last night and I actually wanted one one.

Unknown Speaker  15:03
Well, that's not right.

Speaker 3  15:07
Maybe oh, let's no because we want the asset. Do you want the asset to show that original value still? Ideally Yeah.

Speaker 2  15:18
The original value and then also the it's

Speaker 1  15:25
it's showing as having increased the asset value which which is not right at all

Speaker 2  15:40
okay, the accumulated depreciation or should be a contra

Speaker 3  15:44
I guess I guess we'll switch those switch those around Oh yeah, the degrees is decreasing the equity because the the assets not worth as much anymore yeah, those of you haven't right

Unknown Speaker  16:01
I'll be right back but it's now thinking that the asset is worth what is it about?

Speaker 3  16:14
Right we need to switch those on that transaction we just switch those debits and credits because we're decreasing equity because we're decreasing the value of the assets

Unknown Speaker  16:27
and we're increasing equity was the one that

Speaker 3  16:33
right we need to decrease equity so we didn't make that'd be a debit yeah

Speaker 1  16:45
I'm not sure so in this case then it's still saying 1200 said I'd be depreciation why would that be

Unknown Speaker  17:11
recession 720 per month

Speaker 1  17:20
100 appreciation amount on asset value

Unknown Speaker  17:30
7200 Minus asset salvage

Speaker 1  17:54
incredible how are we calculating the monthly depreciation?

Unknown Speaker  18:22
Begin students

Unknown Speaker  18:34
stateless

Unknown Speaker  18:59
the month yeah there you go

Unknown Speaker  19:05
should be five months depreciation laughs

Unknown Speaker  19:08
Well starting to depreciate it all in six months. Set value

Speaker 1  19:26
this is strictly experimentation I don't think it's immune but just

Unknown Speaker  19:40
the year we were doing this one is tied to the asset that one's tied to the asset

Unknown Speaker  19:53
what is the 1200 referencing?

Speaker 1  19:57
It's trying to depreciate it across six months as of June you reverse through June 30

Speaker 1  20:11
I don't see I don't see where it's taking into account historical

Unknown Speaker  20:19
accumulate cumulated transaction I mean

Unknown Speaker  20:43
your choice

Unknown Speaker  20:53
okay

Speaker 1  21:30
okay, well it turns out I'm gonna have to get with Joel to figure out what's going on on them

Speaker 3  21:37
but the idea would be we should be able to create a transaction prior to that date of service right because the date of service were gone by

Speaker 1  21:49
yeah one transaction prior to the date of service to which that appears to be working correctly Yeah, yeah. But then this one here he's the one that I'm not sure about

Unknown Speaker  22:25
the other

Unknown Speaker  22:38
way we get to hear what's the difference

Speaker 1  22:54
which one one really both 912 960 Well I had created one earlier. I'm going to read one

Speaker 1  23:17
and I will send this one over to Joel for his reference and

Unknown Speaker  23:31
last thing works out

Speaker 1  23:35
ways that could actually have impacted Well, it's still showing the same thing.

Speaker 3  23:45
It should have showed differently to start with if that one was already doing some

Speaker 1  23:52
good points. I will even get my head together Joel and figure out what's going on. Yeah. Okay. That should be it for that.

Speaker 2  24:17
Yeah. Well, it was that and then that depreciation expense account you're going down? Oh, yeah. Give us options on are Yeah. Is that is that a dual thing as well?

Speaker 1  24:36
Two options on on assets. Yeah, because expense account

Unknown Speaker  24:45
is looking at the development updates but

Speaker 2  24:53
no, I didn't. Well, I think can we I think we should create an asset this like a new one that we're putting in services testing to make sure that that's all working correctly then we just mock up an asset or say something that was fine to was bought last month put in service and just

Speaker 1  25:30
there's not much we can do at this point either because I can't figure out how current depreciation numbers are getting calculated. Is appears good?

Speaker 2  25:42
Is there value in looking at a like a new asset to see if the depreciation per month is calculating correctly? Are you saying that it's affecting

Unknown Speaker  25:56
depreciation value is getting calculated correctly? When we look at well I don't think so. I think we got a clear in my opinion we get clear on these revisions first.

Speaker 1  26:17
Like this one here is getting calculated as if we had 10 months left and which is

Speaker 1  26:33
which looks right but it's not taking into account you don't have any way to adjust that. It's not taking into into account prior prior depreciation

Speaker 2  26:46
but where's the getting the 10 month that is that what we're not sure?

Speaker 3  26:52
It would be five but it's 20 Yeah.

Speaker 1  27:00
Yes, it's it's taking so as of July 1, of 23, we have 12 months we're in September it's not going up to months.

Speaker 3  27:09
So our our original transaction was September 6 There does that make a difference?

Speaker 1  27:22
Oh goodness what's a little embarrassing Okay, let's try that first so if we go and it really should be 625

Speaker 2  27:41
so this will just make that the same date we not

Speaker 1  27:52
hoping so but here it's not recognizing is that recognizing any depreciation having been paid up until this point? So it's calculating it's it's calculating as of today and that's that's the part that I don't understand because I thought we were taking into asset recorded depreciation Here we go. This has actually been one

Speaker 1  28:24
commission expense accounts okay, it's not recognizing that transaction because it's expecting it to be Oh, expense

Unknown Speaker  28:37
Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  28:40
So here if we would do

Speaker 3  28:44
expense it out and then the transaction would go from the expense to the

Speaker 1  28:53
bill do you do it in the same transaction? So basically, what you would do is you would just grab this one so a

Speaker 1  29:15
and then and then this one would be tied out to the asset and I don't know that any of the others would have to be

Unknown Speaker  29:33
let's see let's finding it.

Unknown Speaker  29:46
Value and recorded depreciation

Unknown Speaker  29:55
Oh well, let's be clear. is

Unknown Speaker  30:08
no wait

Unknown Speaker  30:18
no the sorry to end and I have my handy little cheat sheet this is actually an experiment but I am not miss England save

Unknown Speaker  30:49
you $5 to the rest of the year then

Unknown Speaker  30:56
love shouldn't be correct

Unknown Speaker  31:00
that's That's seems low

Speaker 3  31:07
well that would be the that's the amount per month over the whole life okay read the writing is out

Unknown Speaker  31:21
in 571 Okay You're right

Unknown Speaker  31:28
so

Unknown Speaker  31:37
but proposing that this is a do it work

Speaker 3  31:42
if it could just if it could just be set to recognize you know getting expense to owner's equity instead of what wouldn't be expensed but like if I could just recognize that owner's equity account then we wouldn't have to do that other

Unknown Speaker  32:00
fancy transaction

Unknown Speaker  32:14
where's the owner's equity injection equipment

Speaker 1  32:26
now why does the okay or if it could let's do this I'm just gonna zero these assets Yes, I know reading problems my favorite

Unknown Speaker  32:56
number or bol is 00 29 Instead of

Unknown Speaker  33:09
being American transsexual announced oh well yeah

Unknown Speaker  33:22
but

Speaker 1  33:28
actually what it means is I would actually be able accumulated depreciation

Unknown Speaker  33:47
hang on here

Unknown Speaker  34:21
why don't we have to take both

Unknown Speaker  35:00
Let me talk it through with all

Speaker 2  35:20
that isn't something we're on, we should we want to design it differently so that you're thinking something like instead of selecting all the GL accounts on our own selecting, like, similar to what you have for new transactions of sale, abandonment impairment, like doing something like that, or defaults to the gray GL accounts and simplifies that process because all the assets were entering currently, all the assets we're entering to start out are already in service and have been depreciated to one extent or another.

Speaker 1  36:12
We I wonder if we want something like an accounting start date and just assume that it's been depreciated correctly up until you know, so we had an accounting start date as one on 124. And it would assume you're at $5 a month depreciation up until then and only look for transactions after that point.

Speaker 2  36:48
And then we're good yes. Well, I would say it would then demand would be earlier state state put in service to look at how many months between date put in service and county start date. And if let's say that's two years then it would look at the monthly depreciation and say two years 24 month the month of depreciation and post that to tie that would it automatically Shinto

Speaker 3  37:21
that equity because it's not going to be tied to an expanse

Speaker 1  37:29
Oh, but at that point we don't really care where it lives we just know it's already been accounted for in accounting and when you sell the ass

Speaker 2  37:39
Yeah, that's a good point because our equity the equity we have now already takes that into consideration all that we care is that the original purchase price is showing and the accumulated depreciation thus far is showing

Unknown Speaker  38:05
I'm just not sure where you're going to get it to go away at

Speaker 3  38:25
because you want you want the asset to have to retain its value you don't want to show any now I want to show on expensed accumulation against it

Unknown Speaker  38:51
because accumulation should just be month by month

Unknown Speaker  38:54
you're saying

Speaker 3  39:12
the accumulated depreciation on the piece of equipment should be the difference between the value of the asset and what still needs to be expensed out right so

Speaker 3  39:44
so it could just live in the accumulated depreciation

Speaker 2  39:53
How would you Okay, so the one we're looking at 7200. That's the initial asset value and then worried about 6800? I think on what's been accumulated? So you mean that doesn't your transaction song balance, right? That's what you're like 72 through 200 for the asset, a contract 16 under what's been accumulate or the accumulated depreciation?

Speaker 3  40:24
And then it would just start from that point and depreciate Ross per month the accumulated depreciation will continue to go up. Okay, where does Where does your expense come from?

Speaker 2  40:49
Okay, wouldn't it be 7200 Is your your asset, the 6800 is accumulated depreciation. And the difference between that is, is all you have innately instead of like that difference is what you have that $400 is what's in equity. And then, would equity would decrease and accumulated depreciation increases, but what happens on a balance sheet, month to month as you depreciate? Like your accumulated goes up, but what's the opposite side of the transaction?

Unknown Speaker  41:29
Well, equity would go down

Unknown Speaker  41:32
on your balance sheet,

Unknown Speaker  41:34
because now your assets are not as high as it was.

Speaker 2  41:38
But I think we entered those transactions wrong. Do we like we ended up? I think we entered the six 800 transaction. We said 6800 is what it's worth. And I think there should just be three transactions like the

Speaker 3  41:58
7200 and that one equity. So accumulated depreciation

Unknown Speaker  42:09
think accumulate depreciate.

Speaker 1  42:15
Drew, are you saying that we could we could look at only accumulated depreciation determine the current value?

Speaker 3  42:25
No, accumulated depreciation should be the amount that would have been expensed prior to now.

Speaker 3  42:38
And so define the actual unexpended value of the asset, you'd have to subtract the accumulated depreciation from the initial value, which is like $400 here.

Unknown Speaker  43:02
But we, you know, if

Speaker 3  43:04
we, I think our expensing of the, our expensing should be a total separate operation from calculating the value of the asset

Speaker 2  43:22
can can we go back to work to the account? Or we can can we go back to where we tied the seven 200 to the asset value look at that transaction

Speaker 2  43:39
so, I think there's where we need to make a change. I think that okay, production equipment, that's correct, I think owner's equity should be should be 400 or whatever their meaning is, and then the third transaction should be

Unknown Speaker  43:56
third line.

Unknown Speaker  43:59
Accumulated depreciation of six Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  44:03
Every simpler way to do that

Speaker 1  44:10
and then the transaction they would do. Yeah, okay, let's try this. Then this is going to be

Speaker 1  44:31
it this guy we would void wars. Okay, but then the other thing that needs to happen, see, I think we could, I think it would make more sense to only look at the accumulated depreciation to defeat. Currently it's looking at total depreciation expenses to figure it out. With the current value is that it would make more sense to take a look at accumulated depreciation. Right? And because that would that would get the historical and then also get, get it going forward.

Speaker 3  45:10
And whether it was actually expensed or not, you know, we're gonna put a number in here this much as you related. I think where he's getting all confused is we're not expensing it and we're trying to accumulate it and then the two are the two together right? Because that right there would be the simplest way to deal with these beginning entries.

Speaker 1  45:37
Okay. So then then our proposal is to change.

Speaker 1  45:57
Addition to calculating asset value, since angles and expensed depreciation prior to the live system

Speaker 1  46:27
okay, there is, there is still an issue, then in how we calculate, we need to change this to take a look at accumulated depreciation account and look at both expense and asset accounts determined to determine that, but apart from that, apart from a networking, here is your this would be your So, what you would want if you want a quick link to do it, then which what we would probably prompt you for is prompt you for a date.

Unknown Speaker  47:06
And we probably had to prompt you for the owner's equity account. Or we just show you a drop listed equity accounts. I don't know.

Speaker 1  47:20
If we have good. We have subtypes written in I really would prompt you for equity accounts. And then so you would enter the as of date for the

Unknown Speaker  47:41
scratchpad here that I can

Speaker 3  47:44
if we would just put in these transactions for these original ones as the date of service, the same date as the date of service. And that would tie our our second or third line out to that date of service as well.

Speaker 1  48:07
Yeah, I think I think so I think the I think an option would I think we could simplify this where we could give you a little link to easily create this where you would say obviously we use the date of service for the transaction, we would automatically add the 72 we would ask you what the purchase price was 7200 we would ask you when your go live date is going to be which would be one 124 we would create your accumulated depreciation with that and then add the owner's equity line item for the balance. I mean, or I could even because it's a one time thing Well, are you gonna be working on this today? Where would you have time to be good?

Speaker 3  49:17
Like I can make entries like that. Today I could do I could do some like that. We could put we could put the assets in once. Without those initial transactions to bet all would be helpful.

Speaker 2  49:36
You're also meeting information from Decolonise on assets right? Unless you want to start putting in limited information that

Speaker 3  49:45
I mean I could probably start with this company right here. But yeah, I mean it's like it's a little bit handicap until till we get more information or until this is Rolling,

Speaker 1  50:00
but I can give you, I can give you a report, if it'd be helpful, I can give you a report to make it easier to enter the starting transaction. If that's something you're gonna be working on today, but if you still need more information from, you know, what the actual assets actually are, when they were purchased for what amounts, etc, that

Speaker 2  50:27
I don't know that I think you do in order to write in order

Speaker 3  50:31
there would be most efficient. Yeah, way. Like, you do what you need to do to make your page for the for the entries. And then till that happens, we'll probably have more assets, and then we'll go from there.

Speaker 2  50:56
And I think this is you mentioned, this being a one time thing I could see as using this in the future as well, when we say, here's an asset that we were just tracking it as finished goods inventory, like, say, a, say, a building that was, well, actually, this is going to be real, where we have buildings that we use for self storage, long term, we're just currently they're just in finished goods. But tenants have been renting them out for three years maybe for Self Storage, and then we could take that bet at some point, we're going to move those to an asset as well. And that's what you're working on would be

Unknown Speaker  51:45
we had more

Unknown Speaker  51:47
used in only the initial setup, I think. No,

Speaker 3  51:54
there should be let me let me jump on there. How long do you have?

Speaker 1  52:40
Okay, well, that was a little bit it was productive.

Unknown Speaker  52:53
So there's two other things that

Speaker 2  53:01
I guess we can cover this one as well, but just one is the

Unknown Speaker  53:06
others. Others make sure

Speaker 2  53:13
they're on that I don't know where you're going with. On the the right account on the AR process, the write off account. Right, and you talk to you about this, but Larry suggested instead of making the user select the GL account, when you write on an AR account, like several paintings or whatever, to build it so that you can have code like write out codes that are then tied to a GL account so you'd basically make a table that says you know, have one it says bad debt customer will never pay. And another that, you know, clear off petty differences, and another maybe guess mountain to cost effective product discount to customer or whatever, so that the codes are pretty self explanatory so that anybody using that doesn't even need to know accounting, they can just like to look at the five options. Click it and they don't even know what GL account goes into. But it clears it out. So it I think it's pretty simple. We just need a table a reference to where we can say what do we want the codes to be and then what do you want the the associated GL accounts to be

Speaker 1  54:39
and it's probably the wrong thing to have these be special payment methods.

Unknown Speaker  54:50
Special payment methods as in

Speaker 1  54:59
payment measured called right off the bat

Unknown Speaker  55:13
or we can pick it up again it at one today have we?

Speaker 2  55:29
Okay, are we talking about the same thing? I might have? Not. But I was talking about on that. That screen that drew it marked up where that dialogue? Like what do we do if there's a remaining balance in an AR, like petty differences 10 cents or five cents, like we're not going to do as the customer. When you're recording payments, you record a payment, you have a remaining balance of 10 cents difference or whatever?

Speaker 1  56:28
Okay, well, let's talk, we might need to even talk about it at one.

Speaker 2  56:36
What about the email on the secondary? What did I call it secondary? invoice or sales? Order? Number two, that makes sense. Basically a feeling for that?

Speaker 1  56:48
Do you want to be able to search more than

Speaker 2  56:52
the that's, that's the primary purpose of of it is being able to search?

Speaker 1  56:59
And is it going to be? Are there any kind of stipulations? Is it always numeric?

Unknown Speaker  57:08
No.

Unknown Speaker  57:12
It's being manually probably could be anything.

Speaker 2  57:19
I mean, okay, as we're gonna give everyone a template to use when creating manual sales orders as part of the process change in the future? And tell them how to like, what format to use, whatever that is. We can make that consistent. But still with humans in manual entry, you're probably going to have some variation there.

Speaker 1  57:55
Sure. Yeah. I don't have any opposition to it. Seems seems reasonable. I think probably the biggest concern is that we'd have some kind of some kind of way to not, you know, handwritten. Let's see, maybe you had a proposal for the name as well.

Unknown Speaker  58:30
Written necessarily ID Yeah. Going to search. Yeah. objection to that. Search might be. Probably search will be slow. To optimize the service, some people have to go home and down, but

Speaker 2  59:08
through, could that be a second, like, you typically search for your standard invoice numbers? And then if you can't find and your next step is you search secondary, or you search manual so

Unknown Speaker  59:22
so IDs, and then that searches those I don't know, is that or should it

Speaker 3  59:29
look good? I mean, it would be it would be nice if it would just if it would go through both. Both lists like manual or if,

Speaker 1  59:45
if it's, if it's freeform, let me know do we do we use partial searches? Do do full searches. For example, somebody puts in I don't know if they're so Id they've got A builder named Joe. And they just put in Joe 14. Let me search for Joe. I guess here it is exact match, we could

Unknown Speaker  1:00:14
do contains there something,

Unknown Speaker  1:00:16
you can do that. And I'd be partial match.

Speaker 2  1:00:25
On the other hand, I think we're inviting complexity here. I think we could just just have the process be here's, here's you use the same format that a similar format that we're using now, like year, year, month, month, day day or something that we have to be, we have to be careful so that we don't

Unknown Speaker  1:00:51
use the same numbers that assists us is right. Like it won't allow. will it allow us to introduce would it allow us to enter duplicate?

Speaker 2  1:01:05
We won't have to enter that. We obviously won't have to enter that secondary number if if we don't have one?

Speaker 1  1:01:14
Correct. I mean, I would. At the point that it's handwritten, there's no guarantee how that thing got generated. So people might literally have send two sales orders out the door with duplicate IDs. There's no stopping that. And I mean, it's pretty, it's pretty likely to have I mean, it's, well, it's not definitely beyond the scope of reason to have it happen. And that's one of the reasons why. Probably none of this is too much work on the back end. But as part of the process, when somebody submits a handwritten sales order that Dwayne's office would turn around and send back the, the, you know, the generated sales order, and just say, you know, for future references is the best way to reference it. And yes, we can go look it up by handwritten Sales Order ID, but we're searching for it separately, I don't know, maybe I'm being too.

Speaker 3  1:02:30
In just doing a wire, there were there would be a field where that second sales order ID and it would just you just have to do it in a separate search.

Speaker 1  1:02:42
That would, that would be my inclination, I think it's the least likely to create confusion. Because it's something

Speaker 3  1:02:51
if you use a certain if you use a different format, than what the system is gonna generate. And the check comes in and says, it's for invoice Joe 14, we're gonna know that that's not normal invoice. And then you just search

Speaker 2  1:03:09
you services, a separate list for the labor, specifically,

Speaker 3  1:03:13
right, the handwritten list. And then there should of course on entry, it should say, Okay, well, this, this ties into the assist number. So it's like when you actually open that? Yeah, what about?

Speaker 1  1:03:35
Yeah, what about my heater thermostat? I'm thinking, I mean, push comes to shove. Ultimately, ultimately, we need to drive it is what's gonna make you guys as process work? Well, I think if we if we combine it with the ID search, then we need to, well, I need to make sure I need to get Josh's sign off on it because he's doing a whole bunch of changes to basically ignore the ID prefix when searching and so we need to make sure that that works with what he's doing and he's got capacity to go chase stuff so we can we can as far as I know I mean, you could have him chase that we want him to

Speaker 2  1:04:19
well, it's probably would be helpful if you have an idea. We we we owe you a What's the format we're going to use planning to use on the manual. And it shouldn't be like you said something different.

Speaker 2  1:04:38
And I was thinking, is it too simplistic if we just use a four digit number you just start at 0001 and you just work however you want to track that and you know for your manual system and you just

Unknown Speaker  1:04:54
remember something like ah and others

Speaker 2  1:04:59
Yeah, Anything that's handwritten, you could do Ah.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:04
Well, whatever number system they want

Speaker 2  1:05:10
or does that have no money? Is? Is that helpful or not for your what you're doing?

Speaker 1  1:05:16
I need to talk to Josh bottom line might be. And then if even if they don't put the H in it when when you guys put them in if even if they don't like the H down, you guys, but at any age down

Speaker 1  1:05:35
I guess the other question is, how many times? Are you guys actually going to have to look up? Sales Orders based on the handwritten ID? Is that going to be a pretty daily process? Do you need it every time you get a deposit for that sales order?

Speaker 3  1:06:00
Is the remarkable one Yeah, you will use it when the check comes in mostly apply that payment to think so if you can look for the customer's name, you can search that way. That'd be one way you could find the proper invoice put it against. Or if you can search, you search that exact payment number which you know, that might be a total of three that were guaranteed. But if you can pull up that customers name and any invoice, then it would show any invoices that are out to him. You wouldn't have to search that number specifically, the fact of the matter is, is most customers don't don't write invoice numbers or send anything along such you know exactly what they think their family anyway.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:55
Who's not customer who's that?

Speaker 2  1:06:59
Well, and process it's going to happen is customer walks in, wants to buy something and pay for it right away. Then handwritten invoice, they pay all of that, then they turn around, sent that information to Dwayne's office, they're going to turn around, they're going to create a sales order, and send it back just verifying that for that whoever did the hand written invoice to verify against that. And then they're going to most likely file that with their handwritten invoice. And then when they

Unknown Speaker  1:07:41
if they apply if they record payment. And the process is to always use, like the SS number, then it will rarely be used. But maybe we're making it.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:00
Yeah, I mean, everything is

Speaker 2  1:08:04
part of me feels like let's, let's make so we have to feel to enter the field, the field to enter it. But beyond that, let's just move ahead with without any sort of sounding board, especially when because here's what if Dwayne's office gets something for you know, the test Joe 14, they're going to say a or send it. I don't have any invoice. Joe 14, what's the assist? Invoice Number? Oh, okay, I've got it here and send it

Speaker 1  1:08:44
I would largely agree with you. And I think I think the primary stakeholder here is Dwayne and his team. And I would you know, Dwayne's already got a customer for managing these payments coming in. And he can I think he can fairly definitely figure out how he wants to do this will be just a column, whether it's something that they want to search for, whether they you want to be able to search for search for partials, I don't know. So yeah.

Speaker 3  1:09:24
Some of the some of those kinds of things are, like, in a way we can test and make it work. But we're still we're still testing this stuff off of assumptions of how we think we're going to need it. Right. So like once we're actually using it then along to be like, okay, yeah, we need a way to search these or I don't know that I really wanted to search those.

Speaker 2  1:09:48
So is that fair just planned to feel that if we want if they have a place to enter that, but beyond that, do not think for now

Unknown Speaker  1:10:00
I like it okay that'd be good

Speaker 1  1:10:08
so yeah thanks for that yep thanks
