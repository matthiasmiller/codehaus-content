Unknown Speaker  00:13
I

Unknown Speaker  01:02
i

Unknown Speaker  01:06
You

Unknown Speaker  01:20
You

Unknown Speaker  02:01
Hey, Man,

Unknown Speaker  02:02
think I've seen you before Long time, no talking

Unknown Speaker  02:07
indeed,

Unknown Speaker  02:18
at a breakfast meeting going Because I'm like holding my Way back to the office. Do?

Unknown Speaker  02:54
Hey, Drew Hello. Morning.

Unknown Speaker  03:00
Mark, good morning,

Unknown Speaker  03:06
Wayne, are you still in Colorado? I am. I'm

Unknown Speaker  03:11
going to try to make it back before the Snowmageddon.

Unknown Speaker  03:17
What are you guys supposed to get there in Kansas,

Unknown Speaker  03:23
four to seven inches. Okay, 47 but

Unknown Speaker  03:28
something like that.

Unknown Speaker  03:30
The worst is the cold. It's gonna be. Looks like Sunday is between negative seven and 12.

Unknown Speaker  03:38
It's cold enough.

Unknown Speaker  03:41
I makes you wish for Bangladesh, doesn't it?

Unknown Speaker  03:47
Yeah, but we've also had a ridiculously warm winter, so I don't mind if we had one cold spell, yeah, you don't

Unknown Speaker  03:58
want to think about what that translates to is wind chill in Kansas when there's nothing to block the Yeah, thankfully, I don't think it's supposed to be very windy, okay, which

Unknown Speaker  04:10
is surprising, because when I saw those low temps, it's like, it's got to be windy, right? It's like maybe 10 miles an hour,

Unknown Speaker  04:18
okay,

Unknown Speaker  04:20
on now it's saying negative four, so it really keeps fluctuating. I guess we'll see.

Unknown Speaker  04:31
Good. Well, I apologize. I had a breakfast meeting run just a little bit late, so I'm like two minutes away from my laptop. Yet

Unknown Speaker  04:41
I'll be there in a

Unknown Speaker  04:44
there in a jiffy. We're

Unknown Speaker  04:56
just trying to make, get our sound or make so we have.

Unknown Speaker  05:01
Hear better.

Unknown Speaker  05:05
Can you hear us? Okay,

Unknown Speaker  05:08
okay, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  05:14
So

Unknown Speaker  05:16
why don't we start with we don't have a lot on the agenda today, but Well, as far as upcoming meetings, if we

Unknown Speaker  05:26
look at

Unknown Speaker  05:28
the fifth and the 19th be the first and third Thursday of next month, does that work for you guys?

Unknown Speaker  05:35
Could we do? Do we have any options besides the 19th?

Unknown Speaker  05:39
Yeah, we could do, we could push it out one more week.

Unknown Speaker  05:48
Or,

Unknown Speaker  05:50
yeah, like the 26 Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  05:53
that'd be fun. That'd be fine,

Unknown Speaker  05:57
yeah,

Unknown Speaker  05:59
and the ninth is good,

Unknown Speaker  06:02
good. So the ninth and the 20 C or the, sorry, the fifth and the 20 C, fifth and 26th that works. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  06:13
So I thought it might be good to just do some housekeeping of all of our incidents today. Now, if you guys think it's better, I think most of it's waiting on on

Unknown Speaker  06:26
a lot of it waiting on me. But if you guys, if you think it's a better use of our time for us to go through them first and then do this next call, I'm fine with that as well.

Unknown Speaker  06:40
What do you think Matthias is great morning and thoughtless. Hang on. Give me a minute before I turn everything sideways.

Unknown Speaker  07:07
I think, I think if we're focused and just recognize call an audible anytime there's stuff we don't know, I think there's enough, typically, there's enough coordination on these things. I don't think it's a waste of time to rip through it together.

Unknown Speaker  07:28
That's instinctively what I would say. But

Unknown Speaker  07:34
you're saying you think it'd be a good, a good thing to go through it now. I think it's, I think it's useful, okay, I'd agree.

Unknown Speaker  07:48
So

Unknown Speaker  07:50
yeah, go ahead and just lead us through, and we'll just Okay

Unknown Speaker  07:57
any of these. I a

Unknown Speaker  08:03
simple change

Unknown Speaker  08:10
that.

Unknown Speaker  08:15
Okay, go ahead and assign that to me. Nick has done that for quite a while already, and I just need to test it. Okay? Well,

Unknown Speaker  08:26
here, let's just do this status, summary,

Unknown Speaker  08:34
deposits. This is on the radar for this be great,

Unknown Speaker  08:39
and he's been working on it.

Unknown Speaker  08:43
Yeah. He has Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  08:46
I think that should just yeah, stay as is, stay as is.

Unknown Speaker  08:52
Record restrictions.

Unknown Speaker  08:55
Dwayne What's the status on this? Do

Unknown Speaker  09:05
I have no idea.

Unknown Speaker  09:08
Is it turned on do with wholesale dealers, some of the wholesale dealer portal work we did. I think,

Unknown Speaker  09:15
yeah,

Unknown Speaker  09:18
oh, what's the last on that?

Unknown Speaker  09:24
I think that's done. If I'm the status summary says done, but the incidents open,

Unknown Speaker  09:33
well, check the little box. But is it? Is it turned on? For sure,

Unknown Speaker  09:40
pretty sure it is okay. I.

Unknown Speaker  10:02
Yeah, that should just be closed.

Unknown Speaker  10:07
What should be the normal we need to figure out when we close incidents. I think because some of these, like we say they're coded and they'll be included, and we're not sure if we should just close them right away or leave them open a week or two, or what do we care? Well, I would suggest, if it's something like this, is basically taking a standard report, user report something like this. I say, just close it. Just close it. Yeah, us to take a look at it, or you want us to look at it like a change. Then I'd say assign it to whoever's Yeah, okay, that sounds good. I like that.

Unknown Speaker  10:46
So this one, I mean working well, other than this feed, it's really slow. Is this a big job to optimize it? Or I think he's done some work, at least.

Unknown Speaker  11:00
This

Unknown Speaker  11:04
is the parent. Let's

Unknown Speaker  11:09
just do

Unknown Speaker  11:10
well actually this file,

Unknown Speaker  11:13
standard company scorecard. I'm fairly confident he did some work on it already. I mean, this week, like I opened it this morning, and it's still because what I'm looking for is if, if,

Unknown Speaker  11:27
if you say that short of if you say the options are,

Unknown Speaker  11:34
it'll cost a lot of time and money to optimize it beyond what it is now. Then I'd say, we close it. If you say

Unknown Speaker  11:44
that's valuable information, but the report's really slow, that's fine. Or we you say it's

Unknown Speaker  11:52
a bit of work, but nothing crazy, then I'd say, we leave it open.

Unknown Speaker  11:56
Seth, I was noticing this with sales orders. I wonder if

Unknown Speaker  12:04
you had a field for accounting company, yeah, either a field or as in, yeah, account impact field for accounting company, or, I guess accounting company field, can we literally just use accounting company field if you have an accounting company easily accessible. We're

Unknown Speaker  12:22
just

Unknown Speaker  12:24
looking checking to see whether it's buildings included. I was thinking so that if you reassign a builder to a different district, you've got a whole bunch of Oh,

Unknown Speaker  12:34
but

Unknown Speaker  12:36
my thought was, what I was thinking was having an index from

Unknown Speaker  12:41
just using index lookups from builder to district, and from district to accounting company, and just create macros. But that was what I was thinking. But I don't know. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  12:51
what's it doing? I didn't look.

Unknown Speaker  12:55
We're looking so from the builder, we're looking at the buildings builder, from that determining the district, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  13:02
from that,

Unknown Speaker  13:06
we're looking at running an index, index lookup on the district to get the accounting company.

Unknown Speaker  13:15
And you're just wanting to pull it from the key, or what,

Unknown Speaker  13:22
that's my thought. But maybe that's ever

Unknown Speaker  13:25
complicating it? It's not

Unknown Speaker  13:29
but we can do it. I don't know if it's going to make a huge difference work, or maybe it will.

Unknown Speaker  13:37
My head's out.

Unknown Speaker  13:42
That's that one actually could cut out two hitting records twice.

Unknown Speaker  13:50
It

Unknown Speaker  13:51
could cut out two. Look up some records. I guess

Unknown Speaker  13:56
we do a lot of that. I noticed this elsewhere in like even so accounting company as well.

Unknown Speaker  14:02
We have, we have similar, similar issue, and it's a type of

Unknown Speaker  14:09
the alternative. The alternative is to have a,

Unknown Speaker  14:14
well, Here's the simple way. I

Unknown Speaker  14:24
is to

Unknown Speaker  14:45
the only real reason. Well, here also dealers.

Unknown Speaker  14:50
We have the same issue with dealers. Then when if somebody would try to move a dealer to different district.

Unknown Speaker  14:58
So one.

Unknown Speaker  15:00
Option would be to create a field I'm going to assume we're never going to associate an accounting company with a different district that sounds, that sounds like an absolute nightmare.

Unknown Speaker  15:11
That's lunacy. So

Unknown Speaker  15:14
the if we would use an X 30 add an X 30 button to update district on a dealer,

Unknown Speaker  15:23
and then and on a builder, and it would update linked buildings

Unknown Speaker  15:28
and linked sales orders, Link buildings for builders, linked sales orders for sales for sales orders, and update the dealer record. So

Unknown Speaker  15:44
well, Matthias question, are you asking whether,

Unknown Speaker  15:50
I guess are you? Is that a question for Dwayne and I on,

Unknown Speaker  15:58
or does that factor in? Like,

Unknown Speaker  16:01
how apt are we to move a, say, a builder or a dealer from one accounting company to the other? Right? I'm

Unknown Speaker  16:09
going to say builder, never dealer.

Unknown Speaker  16:15
Have we ever moved a dealer from one accounting company together?

Unknown Speaker  16:19
But I don't know that we have, I mean, I would be

Unknown Speaker  16:24
from my

Unknown Speaker  16:27
motion. I don't see a problem. I mean, I think that should work just fine.

Unknown Speaker  16:33
But, yeah, it

Unknown Speaker  16:36
was only dead

Unknown Speaker  16:41
Matthias. Give me a 10 second synopsis of what the question is here. I was helping Robert solve a pricing issue. And

Unknown Speaker  16:50
yeah, so

Unknown Speaker  16:52
we could speed up. We could speed up a lot of,

Unknown Speaker  16:57
I think a lot of things throughout the system, if we would store accounting company on the building and sales order.

Unknown Speaker  17:09
And to do so, though, and currently,

Unknown Speaker  17:13
we infer the accounting company based off the district on the dealer record, dealer record, or the dealer for sales orders builder for buildings.

Unknown Speaker  17:24
And so if you want to switch the so it could be a simple x 30 Well, or it could be a there could be a simple x 30

Unknown Speaker  17:33
that just changes it on the builder, record whatever builder, record you're on and changes it for all buildings for that builder. And just just have an X 30 button on both places that updates it, and that's how you change it.

Unknown Speaker  17:46
If you if you ever want to move a sales order from one accounting company to another, if you want to ever move a dealer from one to another or dealer,

Unknown Speaker  18:01
or we could make district be read only after you've got sales orders tied to it, and same and district read only for builders if you have a building tied to it. So if you ever get it set up wrong,

Unknown Speaker  18:11
you have to go temporarily assign it to different

Unknown Speaker  18:16
I don't know. Do

Unknown Speaker  18:22
we have an active and inactive dealer?

Unknown Speaker  18:28
Checkbox builder?

Unknown Speaker  18:32
We do as well.

Unknown Speaker  18:35
So, I mean, if you needed to move a company, you could just inactivate one and read, you know, come up with a new one on the new company

Unknown Speaker  18:44
might not be the what you would prefer. But,

Unknown Speaker  18:50
I mean, here we have lot buildings.

Unknown Speaker  18:54
We have a lot billings dealer that moved from North North Carolina to Ohio.

Unknown Speaker  19:01
There's one that got set up the wrong way, and you fixed it 14 minutes later.

Unknown Speaker  19:08
It was this one that was the lot buildings. One

Unknown Speaker  19:12
is Amish. It's direct the

Unknown Speaker  19:15
well, there's going to be, there's going to be old historical SDI stuff that has gotten moved around in the past, but most of the time, if there's a mistake, it usually happens to the point of creation,

Unknown Speaker  19:28
like, what about

Unknown Speaker  19:31
Tina's Tina's country barns that moved from North Carolina to Indiana?

Unknown Speaker  19:36
When was that?

Unknown Speaker  19:40
Back in 20 January of 25

Unknown Speaker  19:44
Oh, interesting.

Unknown Speaker  19:47
Who moved it? You

Unknown Speaker  19:50
Tina's barn.

Unknown Speaker  19:53
It's probably some shits, right? Clean up stuff. Yeah? Probably.

Unknown Speaker  20:02
I mean, am I correct? Matthias, the other option is to just leave things as they are,

Unknown Speaker  20:09
which the reason for changing would be to make a number of our reports

Unknown Speaker  20:16
faster. That's correct. I mean, there's also a way that we could

Unknown Speaker  20:22
see Seth is less happy with this. It's not elegant. But there's other ways we can do that without putting it directly on there that would still be fast lookups. I don't mind if we want to. I think we probably mainly do it on sales orders and buildings, because they're the ones that get the most traffic. Yeah, I wouldn't do it on anything

Unknown Speaker  20:42
else there. I think it's fair.

Unknown Speaker  20:45
If you wanted to pursue this, my suggestion would be that we actually go look at dealers that have,

Unknown Speaker  20:50
look at all dealers that haven't had sales orders assigned to them in a certain time period, and then just inactivate anything that hasn't been used, make ensure that everything that's active is in the correct district and and then we charge forward.

Unknown Speaker  21:07
Okay, so we have,

Unknown Speaker  21:09
we have option one,

Unknown Speaker  21:11
coding,

Unknown Speaker  21:13
don't use a field option to only allow editing district for builders and dealers if they

Unknown Speaker  21:23
if they have no

Unknown Speaker  21:27
building slash so and then. But option two would basically

Unknown Speaker  21:35
be inactivate

Unknown Speaker  21:38
dealers without sales orders for X time frame,

Unknown Speaker  21:43
review, review all

Unknown Speaker  21:47
remaining dealers, and then lock it down.

Unknown Speaker  21:56
Option three,

Unknown Speaker  21:58
allow changing within that

Unknown Speaker  22:02
builder accounting company,

Unknown Speaker  22:05
we're just using district. Yeah, we're both of these. We're using district.

Unknown Speaker  22:11
Think, well, we have an so accounting company to macro,

Unknown Speaker  22:15
but I'm saying I'm not even finding a builder accounting company, macro. Maybe I'm not blind. Oh, and even here, we're looking at off of the building,

Unknown Speaker  22:26
so on an so we're going from the sales order to the building, to the builder, to the builder, to the builder, to the county company. So

Unknown Speaker  22:54
where is it that districts are used that it would be so terrible to get rid of them?

Unknown Speaker  23:00
Remember, I want to get rid of them. And I know, right, there's places that, yeah, make it just impossible. But why wouldn't we store? Well, I mean, would you want to store accounting, company on the does

Unknown Speaker  23:15
this make any difference? Store counting company on the dealer and

Unknown Speaker  23:19
builder? Yeah, it cuts that one look up.

Unknown Speaker  23:23
I would rather go to accounting companies and keep working to eliminate district. What if

Unknown Speaker  23:33
we did a hybrid of of that and the option one

Unknown Speaker  23:41
with with the quick cash to look up

Unknown Speaker  23:46
accounting company by builder and accounting company by dealer. So it's a simple NDX look up, grab it out of the key

Unknown Speaker  23:58
would be bill.

Unknown Speaker  24:02
A builder by accounting company, not accounting company by builder.

Unknown Speaker  24:10
Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  24:18
and then so this would be,

Unknown Speaker  24:24
however you want to do it, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  24:28
and then a look up.

Unknown Speaker  24:33
You might even want, I don't know if you want to do this, but

Unknown Speaker  24:41
what are the odds? Josh is whiskey stuff that's using district.

Unknown Speaker  24:48
Leave it. Leave the old one as a never. He would never be sitting dealer and builder fields through the whiskey. I can't imagine.

Unknown Speaker  24:58
Jerry's done.

Unknown Speaker  25:00
Translate,

Unknown Speaker  25:06
if we just leave it as a macro.

Unknown Speaker  25:09
Yeah, doesn't need to be editable.

Unknown Speaker  25:15
Actually says there's no reason that Josh would be setting a district on a builder or a dealer, or automatically creating builders or dealers or anything like that, is there,

Unknown Speaker  25:29
you guys know, not that automatically written anyway. I can't imagine a world where he is

Unknown Speaker  25:50
I mean, there's nothing that would stop you from making it editable.

Unknown Speaker  25:54
Okay, here's one other fun thing though. I

Unknown Speaker  26:00
Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  26:05
What do we do with

Unknown Speaker  26:07
that? Can be blank? Do you want to should

Unknown Speaker  26:11
Empire just be

Unknown Speaker  26:13
a blank accounting company?

Unknown Speaker  26:17
Yeah. I mean, can we, we don't. We never use that that I'm aware of. What do you want? Could we just inactivate it?

Unknown Speaker  26:24
Okay, inactivate it and clear out the district. Or is that going

Unknown Speaker  26:31
to create trouble?

Unknown Speaker  26:33
I don't know. I mean, it was an old

Unknown Speaker  26:39
maybe just inactivated, I think should be, yeah, fine. We won't have if we switch to accounting company, we don't have a way

Unknown Speaker  26:49
to, I guess we could keep the okay, but

Unknown Speaker  26:55
okay, this is a bigger issue when we switch to,

Unknown Speaker  27:00
when we switch to

Unknown Speaker  27:02
accounting companies,

Unknown Speaker  27:05
how do we represent New York District, whether it's buildings, whether it's

Unknown Speaker  27:13
affordable, barn company, as the accounting company,

Unknown Speaker  27:19
do you want to be able to and is it fine if that gets included in all ABC reports?

Unknown Speaker  27:25
Yeah, okay, so these should be, these should be migrated over to ABC, and we won't be able to tell the difference between New York versus

Unknown Speaker  27:35
Ohio, correct. Okay? And then purchase part, purchase partners.

Unknown Speaker  27:42
Well, we can leave that. Can leave it blank. It doesn't have to be required. That's

Unknown Speaker  27:48
fine. Just we can just require accounting company, if it's active,

Unknown Speaker  27:53
sure.

Unknown Speaker  27:58
So are you? Are you adding that on all builders, you're adding a field for accounting company,

Unknown Speaker  28:04
district one. The district will just be inferred from the accounting company.

Unknown Speaker  28:13
There's a few more on that list that

Unknown Speaker  28:22
takes like the

Unknown Speaker  28:29
role forming way do we?

Unknown Speaker  28:32
No, okay,

Unknown Speaker  28:35
I think the reason that was there is because we used to do scheduled transit

Unknown Speaker  28:42
schedule, metal deliveries. Do we still do that?

Unknown Speaker  28:48
We do, but I don't think as a as a company, we don't, we don't use it. So it could be inactivated. Yeah, that could definitely be inactivated. And the cricket Valley ones, those need to stay there. Because, yes, those do, those do get used,

Unknown Speaker  29:10
although it's more and more rare of a situation that we actually use them as we get further and further away from the point of that agreement.

Unknown Speaker  29:22
So eventually we won't, we won't ever need to use it anymore. But what about shed rentals? Is that the same story?

Unknown Speaker  29:30
Yeah, that needs to stay around. Every once in a while there we end up repoing a building from shed rentals days, although

Unknown Speaker  29:39
I really should go ahead. Could we? Could we get rid of, okay, if, if we were to

Unknown Speaker  29:47
reach an agreement and say all, yes, please, yes, please. Okay, well, maybe you and I need to talk about that because, because how hard would it be to say, here's, here's the old buildings that could.

Unknown Speaker  30:00
Valet or shed rental still owns that they're trying to sell on

Unknown Speaker  30:05
on these steel lots, and let's just make a deal buy them all back and

Unknown Speaker  30:11
moving forward, if we have, I mean moving forward, well,

Unknown Speaker  30:16
we may have one, or

Unknown Speaker  30:18
we're that we'll have very few that fall in that agreement. We'll just the builder would just buy all of those outright, and then we could get rid of the three cricket valleys in the shed around this one and just make everything real nice. But listen, if you get that done, I will represent cricket Valley and buy you a steak dinner,

Unknown Speaker  30:40
and we will all be happy.

Unknown Speaker  30:43
Well, I'll need your help on how many sheds would would we be looking at? I'd have to go, Yeah, I'd have to go dig that out. But

Unknown Speaker  30:51
okay, let's take a look at it and see if we can just, I mean, it's one of those things that I think we would it wouldn't be hard to get everyone to agree, and then I could have my steak dinner, but

Unknown Speaker  31:03
exactly,

Unknown Speaker  31:05
I just like to get it planned out even much more so than eating a steak.

Unknown Speaker  31:11
Well, maybe I need to raise the maybe I need to raise the incentive a little bit higher

Unknown Speaker  31:18
good, I think the the others. I mean, there's, there's some like that,

Unknown Speaker  31:24
okay, is there an easy way to see how much like the to be determined, one in Ohio and the ABC miscellaneous, how much those have actually been used.

Unknown Speaker  31:34
We could do a building search by it. Oops, sure. There's no buildings on it. I think some of those are literally as a

Unknown Speaker  31:43
polling place for purchase orders.

Unknown Speaker  31:47
Purchase Orders, I think,

Unknown Speaker  31:51
yeah, that's what they that's what they were originally created for. And I have a feeling they're not, they're no longer being used. We had one to be determined. Well, to be determined is, or, well, one miscellaneous back in December,

Unknown Speaker  32:06
to be determined is a little unsure, because wouldn't you want to look at the history? Because theoretically, yeah, you really should look at, yeah, they probably don't stay in here, right? No, they don't.

Unknown Speaker  32:25
So then I'll make a note for both of those and check with Aaron if you can't just inactivate those. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  32:33
so then the dealer list. Here's the dealer list. Here are all the dealers that aren't tied out to

Unknown Speaker  32:42
districts.

Unknown Speaker  32:45
That are active, but no district,

Unknown Speaker  32:53
plus the New York ones. Dwayne,

Unknown Speaker  32:56
do you see problem if we just inactivate? Up all of them the top all except the,

Unknown Speaker  33:05
hold on. Let me make this. Let me make my window a little bit bigger so I can

Unknown Speaker  33:12
a lot of those. Some of those are chess rec

Unknown Speaker  33:17
dealer. Some are just, I

Unknown Speaker  33:25
Oh,

Unknown Speaker  33:27
yeah.

Unknown Speaker  33:29
Under the what's the Yes? No. Matthias, active, active versus inactive, yeah, okay, yeah, all of those up there in the active, those are,

Unknown Speaker  33:42
I mean, what was your time frame on sales order?

Unknown Speaker  33:46
I didn't do a time frame on sales order.

Unknown Speaker  33:52
What did you? What did you? What's your substance? Blank districts, blank districts, for New York District. Blank districts, Oh, for goodness, if they're blank districts, by all means, just deactivate them and spend no more time thinking about it. And then the New York ones, those three can be inactivated as well, because those are, I think all three of those are sheds, right,

Unknown Speaker  34:16
including the Empire.

Unknown Speaker  34:23
This. This guy too. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  34:34
district is a required field,

Unknown Speaker  34:39
thanks.

Unknown Speaker  34:42
Well, there's always this. That's why we were trying to get rid of them. Silly

Unknown Speaker  34:48
dealer name and the

Unknown Speaker  34:58
record subset is.

Unknown Speaker  35:01
It is dealer is active and is

Unknown Speaker  35:06
in a dealer district. Or dealer district equals New York,

Unknown Speaker  35:13
and then,

Unknown Speaker  35:19
okay, is active. And just to make sure we're not

Unknown Speaker  35:25
preview it first,

Unknown Speaker  35:31
okay, is active and we don't have a district or it's New York, said it is inactive. Very same, okay, wait for it. Um, Adam.

Unknown Speaker  35:45
Boom, all

Unknown Speaker  35:46
right. Well, that was fun. So now, when we look at dealers, where your dealer list dropped a little bit, but we've got, we've got, we've got districts for everything else, so we're good. If

Unknown Speaker  35:59
you guys want to go through and clean this up at any point. I suppose

Unknown Speaker  36:05
you create a report sometime for I don't know what number you want to see, number of sales orders in the last

Unknown Speaker  36:12
year, or

Unknown Speaker  36:14
date of the last sales order two years.

Unknown Speaker  36:19
I think it's something we should do at some point, but I think it's good right now. Okay, so we'll switch to we'll switch to accounting company. We're going to leave the district as a macro for Josh.

Unknown Speaker  36:30
Require accounting company, if it's active,

Unknown Speaker  36:36
we'll have a way to look

Unknown Speaker  36:40
at the building builder, easily, quickly,

Unknown Speaker  36:43
if we're company ID and that, and then,

Unknown Speaker  36:51
you know, I don't know.

Unknown Speaker  36:55
Also add a note to update accounting impact

Unknown Speaker  37:01
is, don't we? It? Either that or make the look of the district fast. Because we don't,

Unknown Speaker  37:08
we key off district,

Unknown Speaker  37:12
if you go into so accounting impact,

Unknown Speaker  37:15
that's may not be the best one.

Unknown Speaker  37:19
Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  37:21
this guy, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  37:24
I mean, if we would just switch,

Unknown Speaker  37:27
right, we just need to make sure we

Unknown Speaker  37:31
Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  37:33
I think I'll do that.

Unknown Speaker  37:36
It will be happy. If he doesn't have to

Unknown Speaker  37:40
touch it probably will be okay. What's the priority on this? Well, I I say this. I think this is a broad speed up. I don't have a specific number for how much this specifically speeds up the company's scorecard, but it seems like a sane speed up. Plus, Plus, it's going to be sorry. I should let you finish.

Unknown Speaker  38:00
I just can say it's going to be a small one across the system rather than a big one in one place.

Unknown Speaker  38:06
I mean, the priority is not, not high, it's, it's, it's inconvenient with the scorecard being a little bit slow. But that's all so I would, I probably put it in high right now,

Unknown Speaker  38:20
your definition of the scorecard being slow and my definition of the scorecard being slow are apparently two different things. That thing takes

Unknown Speaker  38:28
an ice age to run.

Unknown Speaker  38:30
Well, I know, but it's in the grand scheme of things, it's,

Unknown Speaker  38:35
I say it's somewhere between,

Unknown Speaker  38:38
yeah, it's like coffee. You just turn it on when you get there, and then you come back. Well,

Unknown Speaker  38:47
it's

Unknown Speaker  38:48
being auto generated and automatically sent out speed. Matter doesn't really not matter that much.

Unknown Speaker  38:54
Well, unless you're trying to set it up for for, you know, to go out and you're testing it, and every single time, every single time, every time you want to make sure you got the right settings, and it goes and sits there and cranks for about a small ice age, yeah, what's

Unknown Speaker  39:09
the priority on cupping stint from po ID,

Unknown Speaker  39:17
same? I mean, are we stuck? Are we stuck there? I think Nick and Aaron had mapped something out. Then there was some Seth didn't like it. Seth did like it.

Unknown Speaker  39:28
So what? What should we do? Seth, like I'm trying to remember, this has been a while.

Unknown Speaker  39:38
Oh,

Unknown Speaker  39:40
go ahead, Seth,

Unknown Speaker  39:42
we've, we've got

Unknown Speaker  39:45
a macro there. The look, po ID knows sus. It's pulling the try to pull a spin from very manually from

Unknown Speaker  39:54
a PO ID, I think, as I recall and I thought.

Unknown Speaker  40:00
Well, it feels like we're approaching it from the wrong way. We should be setting a stin field that generates that helps make the PO ID, rather than the other way around,

Unknown Speaker  40:11
rather than saying if

Unknown Speaker  40:14
the PO ID starts with this, well, then maybe it's a stin or if it starts with this, or if it starts with this, or if it starts with

Unknown Speaker  40:21
this, but maybe it's just how it is.

Unknown Speaker  40:25
You're saying we should approach it from,

Unknown Speaker  40:31
okay, so, so what happens is, when we go to place in an order for specific product or or for a specific building, custom door, and we know that this is for, you know, this stint, that's how we identify when it comes in and track it

Unknown Speaker  40:46
was your thought to say

Unknown Speaker  40:49
at that point, say, Well, this is for a specific stint.

Unknown Speaker  40:53
You select the stin and then it, it generates

Unknown Speaker  40:58
the the purchase order

Unknown Speaker  41:01
ID at the ID, yeah, something like that would make more sense

Unknown Speaker  41:07
to me. I would agree. I mean, if you go into look right in there, Matthias, the PO ID contains stin. I

Unknown Speaker  41:15
don't know what the workflow is. It might not be Illinois. It was just looking at as well. I'm trying to remember I should have taken notes back when I had looked at this.

Unknown Speaker  41:25
I mean, the S prefix is sane, and there might actually be, Josh might actually have macros for prefixes. I don't know if he does or not.

Unknown Speaker  41:33
I was thinking there was a lot more hard coding going on. Well, there might have been, when you looked at it. Who knows?

Unknown Speaker  41:41
Seth, I wonder, is this something that, when Nick's here next week, that maybe you Nick and Aaron should just look at and just,

Unknown Speaker  41:51
yeah, I think that could be an option.

Unknown Speaker  41:55
Do you have an objection to it as it stands? Now, we're just looking at the s prefix

Unknown Speaker  42:01
and using ID no suffix,

Unknown Speaker  42:05
I think that's fairly sane. What's the PO, Id no suffix? Maybe that was

Unknown Speaker  42:11
low No,

Unknown Speaker  42:14
this is the issue. Yeah, that that was what I wasn't liking.

Unknown Speaker  42:21
Like, is there if you would just haven't if, but the ID no suffix, like, if you're, if you would, if you would, generate your POS, like,

Unknown Speaker  42:32
like, s1, 234, dash, whatever. I don't know what, what, then

Unknown Speaker  42:38
we could just literally use ID no suffix.

Unknown Speaker  42:43
Like, yeah, this is what was making me queasy.

Unknown Speaker  42:50
Like, if you're, if you're Po, let's, let's go to these people. Let's, let's find one. Let's get specific, if you, if you go to report with, with all purchase orders

Unknown Speaker  43:00
that are linked to a stem. I think

Unknown Speaker  43:04
you quickly see what it what it is like if you would do instead of.bo if you could do dash Bo, if that's an option,

Unknown Speaker  43:21
is that an option?

Unknown Speaker  43:26
Yeah. I mean, basically, what we're trying to say is we we generate the purchase order and

Unknown Speaker  43:35
then we're trying to use this to prompt us to remember, Oh, this looks like it should be linked to a specific building based on what we entered.

Unknown Speaker  43:44
And then we there's a in the more

Unknown Speaker  43:48
drop down there's there's a place where you link it to an actual stem. The more button

Unknown Speaker  43:57
that's beautiful

Unknown Speaker  44:00
juice in chosen,

Unknown Speaker  44:03
yeah, and then you then, yeah, I mean, but here we really like this. Oh, that's invalid,

Unknown Speaker  44:13
see, but this, this logic isn't catching the STI prefixes,

Unknown Speaker  44:19
true. I yeah,

Unknown Speaker  44:25
how is how

Unknown Speaker  44:27
is he doing? Because that's a sales order ID,

Unknown Speaker  44:34
right,

Unknown Speaker  44:41
right?

Unknown Speaker  44:45
Is, well, here, okay, here's the, here's, here's the short answer.

Unknown Speaker  44:51
If we can

Unknown Speaker  44:54
make all POS use the format of.

Unknown Speaker  45:20
Right

Unknown Speaker  45:25
and I had suggested that we just create a report that would automatically link it when you create a new one, which I think they're good with that. But do we? Do we need

Unknown Speaker  45:37
both of the options?

Unknown Speaker  45:40
Well, when Go ahead, Mark, I'm just, I'm just,

Unknown Speaker  45:45
I'd like to discuss this with Aaron and see if, I mean, do we actually need this part of me feels, it's, it's, we're doing a lot of extra work to catch, I

Unknown Speaker  45:54
don't know, make us a little, almost a little lazy, like, I mean, it's just a part of what you need to do when you're linking it north. Well, let's not complicate it.

Unknown Speaker  46:05
Before we do any more work, I'd like to go discuss

Unknown Speaker  46:09
it with Aaron and make sure that we actually

Unknown Speaker  46:13
that's good. Okay. Well, there's also this question of

Unknown Speaker  46:17
if, if push comes to shove, can we put show Sten

Unknown Speaker  46:22
or out, or even put, even, put the Sten check box

Unknown Speaker  46:30
right here,

Unknown Speaker  46:32
and then allow the and then, and then make sure that you put in something that is where the prefix is. Is this prefix here? It's a stin or stin dash or, well, Sten or stin dash and and we stop it in the underlying field that makes your matches,

Unknown Speaker  46:50
which make entry easier. But anyway, I

Unknown Speaker  47:09
Well, actually, that's it.

Unknown Speaker  47:13
Priority on this one.

Unknown Speaker  47:16
Well, just drop it down in a medium for now.

Unknown Speaker  47:20
Then if we and should assign, be assigned to someone else,

Unknown Speaker  47:32
syndicate user reports. I

Unknown Speaker  47:37
mean, I think

Unknown Speaker  47:39
this is the one you're waiting on.

Unknown Speaker  47:42
No

Unknown Speaker  47:44
one. We keep kicking under the rug

Unknown Speaker  47:48
this time.

Unknown Speaker  47:58
Okay, so I think Seth, you finally went ahead and inactivated a or, yeah, a whole bunch, because you never heard back from us. Yes. So, so far, we haven't had any hernias in regret for that. So I think there was like one or two reports that need to be pulled back out. But out of the 200 I archive everything, that's a pretty good percentage. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  48:23
I mean, what happens if we

Unknown Speaker  48:26
did you archive all of these,

Unknown Speaker  48:29
not all of them? No, there was some that I think I knew were still being run to that I purposely skimmed. But, but what you, I mean, basically, you need us to go through and get our heads together and say, well, these, we actually need these, and let's turn them into standard reports. Or we don't, is that? I think so, yeah, well, or we can archive them, and you can, you can holler, and at the point that you need them, we'll write up a job to pull them out and do something with it. That's a little painful, but I

Unknown Speaker  49:05
so I would say that we should either do that or else just schedule it for, say, March or something, instead of

Unknown Speaker  49:13
like, we're, we're not going to get to it now. I mean, yeah, with your honest, we're just not going to, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  49:24
it.

Unknown Speaker  49:26
What if we just

Unknown Speaker  49:29
push it down into medium and assign it to

Unknown Speaker  49:34
assign it to me, and then we'll make a note of we'll schedule to look at this, say, in March. And then, yeah, is the manufacturer price, take breakdown working? I think Nick got that set up for you

Unknown Speaker  49:48
don't know, on the phone menu, would that have gone live already on the data it should be on, it should be working.

Unknown Speaker  49:56
Is.

Unknown Speaker  50:02
Assign it to you, and have you go ahead and assign or Gabe Yoder, I think he's here,

Unknown Speaker  50:08
yeah, assign it to him, and then he can test it. Do

Unknown Speaker  50:21
it

Unknown Speaker  50:26
April we want. Is this the one I wanted to bring in Aaron on? Well, there's two. I think there's two of them, yeah, yeah, I'd say, let's just leapfrog those for right now.

Unknown Speaker  50:37
This is

Unknown Speaker  50:40
the simply. The

Unknown Speaker  50:43
Hey,

Unknown Speaker  50:46
oh yeah, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  50:53
Mark and truescourt. Let me make sure

Unknown Speaker  50:59
change Well, I think the change of this comes through.

Unknown Speaker  51:02
This isn't

Unknown Speaker  51:06
good when all the very high stuff is saying needs drew to do this at the end of it.

Unknown Speaker  51:14
It's better than needing Dwayne to do it.

Unknown Speaker  51:19
That's your opinion.

Unknown Speaker  51:22
Yeah, it's been live for a good while now. Can I, I mean, can I just go ahead and change these quick CVS discount adjustment and all those on or after invoice date? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  51:34
we have

Unknown Speaker  51:36
CVS,

Unknown Speaker  51:38
CVS commission, CVS building and adjustment for customer overpayment,

Unknown Speaker  51:46
DBS commission building

Unknown Speaker  51:49
on or after

Unknown Speaker  51:53
adjustment,

Unknown Speaker  52:02
you do it. I believe in you. There was something to do for me on,

Unknown Speaker  52:08
yeah, that was that, is

Unknown Speaker  52:11
it assigned to me? It

Unknown Speaker  52:14
needs to be

Unknown Speaker  52:16
now. It's just one person left, and it's you. It's that, Indiana, Michigan, yeah, I saw that yesterday somewhere. I was looking for something.

Unknown Speaker  52:24
Is that in here, Indiana, Michigan tax thing? Yeah, I was in that. Yeah, we'll move it down to the

Unknown Speaker  52:36
Yeah. They saw a building Tuesday when I was doing taxes. Like, Oh, this really should be paid to Michigan, but,

Unknown Speaker  52:44
so we played Daxton Miami.

Unknown Speaker  52:51
Wow, this is really not wanting to save.

Unknown Speaker  52:58
Hey, fine.

Unknown Speaker  53:01
No idea, okay.

Unknown Speaker  53:13
Oh, the transaction errors should be working now, I forgot to check it off, but it's working.

Unknown Speaker  53:19
There was one game through this morning,

Unknown Speaker  53:22
nice. It's been, I think it was broken since, like, early last year,

Unknown Speaker  53:29
and we just never noticed. Yeah, 25 was last year. Yeah, that's where, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  53:35
it was some what had changed,

Unknown Speaker  53:40
or maybe even 20. I'm trying to remember, I think it was when we added asset to

Unknown Speaker  53:47
right transactions, and the

Unknown Speaker  53:51
columns got out of sync, and the x 30 wasn't creating these errors anymore, and we just didn't notice,

Unknown Speaker  53:59
which is two

Unknown Speaker  54:02
for okay so Drew, is this back in your Is there anything? I mean, I think this puts it soundly back in your court. Is this something we need to keep open

Unknown Speaker  54:12
or

Unknown Speaker  54:16
for you to review?

Unknown Speaker  54:20
I mean, I'm going to be looking at that stuff again here, just no probably starting next week.

Unknown Speaker  54:29
So yeah, just put it in my cord, and then I'll just close it if we don't come up with anything.

Unknown Speaker  54:48
Well, actually, we should, we should see, here are all of these priorities. Yeah, yeah, we changed a bunch of priorities. So.

Unknown Speaker  55:02
The AP report not to issue what

Unknown Speaker  55:05
we have a proposal. What's the priority on this?

Unknown Speaker  55:10
Go ahead. Seth,

Unknown Speaker  55:13
yeah, it's just, I was saying we've it's just been very beneath more important stuff for the last few months.

Unknown Speaker  55:21
What is it? I didn't even, I don't understand, what is the dating that makes the day that we do a notch a file. We create a notch a file. It makes AP report off for that. Oh, we saw some of that while being portably that audit. But I thought it's so that has not been fixed yet, and it's a difference different banks setting where we can No, no, what we're going to do is a matter of moving

Unknown Speaker  55:53
the date, the effective date of the notch file.

Unknown Speaker  55:58
It would so that accounting impact. I think right now, it's probably just the day you create the file sit. Is that right? Matthias that if you create a file and then add some more items to the next day and then upload it, it'd be off by a day, I think, is what's happening? No, the report is based on the date that it shows so the report says the invoice was paid the day the notch file was created. The notch file is dated for the next day, because that's what the bank, the bank saying it's going to be processed the next day. So we had to, we had to date the notch file for the next day. So that's where our two day difference is.

Unknown Speaker  56:41
So are we going back to the invoices we're paying and changing the payment date on the invoice to match the notch of file? Not sure what the fix was.

Unknown Speaker  56:50
We were going to change one yes. Vendor invoice payment date would automatically be sent to the natural file upload date and the Confirm upload process. I think youth should be a medium priority.

Unknown Speaker  57:04
It's not. I

Unknown Speaker  57:06
mean, when it when AP is off by 50 or 100,001 day and it's on the next day, it's not a like, we know what it is, not

Unknown Speaker  57:14
an issue.

Unknown Speaker  57:16
It's only 50, right? Yeah, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  57:24
Oh, this.

Unknown Speaker  57:28
This is something for Dwayne. Just, I think this was a process,

Unknown Speaker  57:36
Dwayne, I think this is one.

Unknown Speaker  57:39
I think your office gets a little

Unknown Speaker  57:41
over excited to finalize payroll. Sometimes I'm joking.

Unknown Speaker  57:47
This is a pet peeve of years when some certain individuals say, Yeah, finalize payroll, and then they say, Oh, I'm finalizing it. Yes, I think that's what happened. So are you? Are you implying that once someone says, finalize payroll, we should wait 24 hours.

Unknown Speaker  58:04
I'm okay with that.

Unknown Speaker  58:06
I have not been in your seat, but I think, I think in the gun industry, they call that a cool down period. So

Unknown Speaker  58:19
I think leaving this word is is fine on that, because that is there's, there's, I'm pretty sure there's no development on this.

Unknown Speaker  58:30
Up.

Unknown Speaker  58:35
Could we,

Unknown Speaker  58:36
well, okay, could we start by

Unknown Speaker  58:39
putting these in order first, and then

Unknown Speaker  58:49
we could, although I feel a little

Unknown Speaker  58:52
on qualified,

Unknown Speaker  58:58
part of me would almost like to go through them, make sure I know what, what all we have before we which is

Unknown Speaker  59:07
good, that's fine. The wholesale dealer portal.

Unknown Speaker  59:19
Is there anything left with it? There's a new field and import to help with the payment process.

Unknown Speaker  59:26
Dwayne. Is there anything left with it?

Unknown Speaker  59:29
No, I think we stalled on this because of some other limitations. I don't remember what they were, but I think Mark and I had kind of decided to back burner it for a while, I think we well, I mean, close this, and then once we somebody's going to have to invest some work, once we actually get wholesale dealers to start using this fully, and then we might have other tasks come up. But I think

Unknown Speaker  59:55
closing it for now and then dealing with stuff if it comes up, would be my suggestion.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:00
It.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:01
I like that suggestion.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:08
We got. This is this resolved? This is resolved? True, sent an email. I think so, the 4500 transaction mismatches.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:15
Oh, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:20
Oh, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:00:27
clicking.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:29
Well, did a lot of clicking. And then I got a call from Dwayne saying, We have to stop clicking. And then I went create next 30.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:38
Was this like the 4000 transactions? Yes, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:00:47
we wore out three mouse in. Mouse

Unknown Speaker  1:00:55
is so mice, yes,

Unknown Speaker  1:00:59
the technical term is Meese.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:04
I like to, I'm not sure if we're ready to do this now, but I like to push this,

Unknown Speaker  1:01:10
just drop it into okay, it is in high for right now this,

Unknown Speaker  1:01:14
I'd like to see if we could move forward with this, but I know there's some, let's stay out of the details for right now,

Unknown Speaker  1:01:22
cash flow reports,

Unknown Speaker  1:01:26
just waiting on you guys to

Unknown Speaker  1:01:29
I mean, well, there are two notes probably the same thing that drew said earlier. I mean, I think we should schedule for

Unknown Speaker  1:01:39
I mean, the reality is, we probably won't get to it until end of

Unknown Speaker  1:01:44
February, 1 of March. What do you, I mean, just with your end stuff, right? So I'd say, drop it into medium, assign it

Unknown Speaker  1:01:54
to be the human being.

Unknown Speaker  1:02:00
Well, no, I mean, it can go to me. I'm pretty sure we'll have a conversation before we do anything. So I'm going to mark my calendar schedule, or to look at this, yeah, like February, end of February.

Unknown Speaker  1:02:19
I think this is designed. Just needs priority.

Unknown Speaker  1:02:27
Is this? What is this to send out a remittance email

Unknown Speaker  1:02:33
files, we should include credit memos, because otherwise the numbers look off.

Unknown Speaker  1:02:39
We're sending the net on an invoice instead of doing the total invoice minus all the credit memos applied to it. How much of an issue is this creating?

Unknown Speaker  1:02:50
There's not that many times there are those, but, but this is higher than the other 80. The other Yeah, I would say so. I mean, this is clarity with the vendors. So I would say, so And okay, or maybe they're maybe both go hand in hand, if they're

Unknown Speaker  1:03:09
connected to notch files, I don't know. But is it easier to do both at the same time than separate Okay? I'd say, let's, let's. I think we should plan to prioritize. This works the top. But

Unknown Speaker  1:03:23
we'll come back to that when we go through this. What is

Unknown Speaker  1:03:29
clarify steps for user?

Unknown Speaker  1:03:33
Or is this the one?

Unknown Speaker  1:03:38
Yeah, we concluded just to do the cheap solution of a message.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:43
Does that mean it's done? It's not done. It's another one of those that got buried.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:50
It's fast, like I can have Sean or Jasper do it very quickly. It's just

Unknown Speaker  1:03:56
sweet. It wasn't priority, and I've been busy.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:02
Well, if it's fast and you can delegate it to some, to somebody, I'd say, let's just move it up into very high. Let's just do it. That's good.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:20
Oh, this is fun. Po being split

Unknown Speaker  1:04:24
between two vendor invoices. The $48 in the second VI that comes in later is currently accounted for. The rNv report does not recognize that part of the PO should be on the rNv report.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:45
Don't know what this feels

Unknown Speaker  1:04:48
true, um, kind of,

Unknown Speaker  1:04:52
is it something that I mean, is this a one off, or we,

Unknown Speaker  1:04:55
well, it's, it's similar to that AP thing. But.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:00
A notch of files like it does correct itself.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:04
It just it creates a number that you go chasing down till you figured out what it was. And you spend a lot of time,

Unknown Speaker  1:05:11
you know, chasing something. What if you drop it to medium and leave it there? So then I

Unknown Speaker  1:05:28
hmm,

Unknown Speaker  1:05:29
Dwayne, can we close this as the last something was done? Yes. March, 31 25

Unknown Speaker  1:05:36
absolutely,

Unknown Speaker  1:05:40
absolutely either Dwayne failed or Dwayne never did try well, but by this point, if, if we haven't had any update on it for an entire year, that means it's just working.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:54
Either that or everybody that was having a problem got admin privileges.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:59
Oh, well, that's the latter. Is probably what happened.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:10
We have a proposal select deleting a purchase order if a vendor invoice links to it, do a historical cleanup on the RG for deleted purchase orders. Confirm after the update. We don't have any stranded in this

Unknown Speaker  1:06:22
report. Yeah. This report.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:29
It makes me very gleeful when I see report links that just go to archived reports.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:38
I mean this, this is a relatively simple fix as well. Is this something that could be delegated to?

Unknown Speaker  1:06:46
It's faked out, and could be delegated just like the one earlier, to try? I think so. It's a little more complicated, but not I'd say, let's just terrible. Take care. Just knock it out. Just yeah, get it done.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:01
All right, so that gives us

Unknown Speaker  1:07:05
Juno drop.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:07
Just quickly read through these.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:11
First one's not important. The next one, we already looked at GL Account renaming. I think that's all and isn't that? That's enough. That's not in my court. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:07:24
I think to decide what names we want to use, but yeah, assign it to

Unknown Speaker  1:07:30
to me and just leave it there. I think that's what's the x what are the what was the x 30? We're talking about Matthias

Unknown Speaker  1:07:39
match on right, column.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:47
Imagine the change, oh, is that from the PDF? There

Unknown Speaker  1:07:55
something like that? I think we were wanting a way to

Unknown Speaker  1:08:00
match on the base account name and assign the new IMS account or something matching the right column,

Unknown Speaker  1:08:09
aim in the left column.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:12
I mean, should we develop the exit, or should we just wait until we actually have wait until the okay.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:18
I would wait till we know sounds good.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:23
He will import time card information that one's

Unknown Speaker  1:08:29
that that's right or, I mean, that's

Unknown Speaker  1:08:35
what. That's no. Go ahead and close this one out. This will come up again, but probably not till the end of the year, and there's, yeah, we'll deal with it.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:58
Then just acknowledge that we're going to kick the can down the

Unknown Speaker  1:09:03
road.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:05
I thought we had another project like this. That is

Unknown Speaker  1:09:15
that that needs to stay there. I

Unknown Speaker  1:09:20
Oh, I think we did look at it. I think Matthias, your comment was, this is a Seth project with your help, something like that. Yeah, it's, it is that?

Unknown Speaker  1:09:31
But that's, we want to get to that sometime this year. So I think leaving it road is, is good.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:41
Whoops. Just translate. Transaction.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:45
We have a proposal in this one, I'm pretty sure as well, yeah, this, there's a lot of cleanup I need to do there. Again, this is one of those. Well,

Unknown Speaker  1:09:56
if we get time, we'll, we'll make this part of our year end. Close.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:00
If not, it'll be more like March. Is it a sign? It it should be a sign to me, if it's not, or I think that's you're waiting on me to do cleanup, and then you're going to then it'll be back to you to

Unknown Speaker  1:10:14
Yeah, yeah, you're right. We do need, well,

Unknown Speaker  1:10:18
I think the thought was

Unknown Speaker  1:10:21
clean up the existing ones that are there that are not matching with what they should, that are wrong. And then beyond that, you would make so the creating a new asset, part of it is is automated, where you select your asset type and it would pre populate your some of your accounts,

Unknown Speaker  1:10:45
right? But I was trying to remember, I was thinking

Unknown Speaker  1:10:53
the depreciation expense.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:00
I'm not sure if this is right, because doesn't the expense account depend on the

Unknown Speaker  1:11:07
like anytime you put it under a specific asset account.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:14
No, you might have one asset account, but multiple expense accounts, correct? But the asset account and the accumulated depreciation account need to be the same while they're obviously different accounts, but the same thing, like, if you if you Right, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:11:33
but I don't know that there's a assets

Unknown Speaker  1:11:38
and expenses. Are you saying there's nothing keeping you from doing the development to

Unknown Speaker  1:11:46
do that now? I mean, the cleanup still needs to happen, but this could,

Unknown Speaker  1:11:54
well, I think part of what I'm saying here is that

Unknown Speaker  1:11:58
we should use a subtype of, well, this isn't the right one. We should probably not

Unknown Speaker  1:12:07
if you go down to 12, like some of the 1207,

Unknown Speaker  1:12:11
like to say so this is, this is a fixed asset. We should change this to be accumulated depreciation. And when it is accumulate accumulated depreciation, we should give you a field for what is the asset? What is the correlating asset

Unknown Speaker  1:12:29
that it's accumulating depreciation, asset class, sorry, not the class, but the sorry. What's the course corresponding financial account

Unknown Speaker  1:12:39
that's like? That ties out to this accumulated depreciation.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:45
But wouldn't you start with it from the other side with what's the asset account, and then bring in the correlating

Unknown Speaker  1:12:53
accumulated depreciation?

Unknown Speaker  1:12:57
From a data modeling standpoint, it's simpler to do it this way, because,

Unknown Speaker  1:13:06
but I mean,

Unknown Speaker  1:13:08
well, I guess

Unknown Speaker  1:13:10
on No, alternatively, no, that's fine. You could on the asset on the asset account. You could also, if it is of type fixed asset, you would have a drop list of accumulated depreciation accounts that you could select, select

Unknown Speaker  1:13:23
from,

Unknown Speaker  1:13:28
and then, and so you could choose,

Unknown Speaker  1:13:33
on the

Unknown Speaker  1:13:34
on the asset, you choose the class, you could choose the the

Unknown Speaker  1:13:39
financial account for the asset. You could choose the expense account, and then the the accumulated depreciation account would just dovetail in based on what you selected as the asset account.

Unknown Speaker  1:13:53
But you could okay, you

Unknown Speaker  1:13:56
the consistency is there, or you should be able to just on the asset select the asset type, and it automatically

Unknown Speaker  1:14:06
knows what your

Unknown Speaker  1:14:09
asset account is and your accumulated depreciation account. And the only ones that you have to manually, manually select are your expense accounts, like where it's

Unknown Speaker  1:14:20
sure. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:14:23
that makes sense.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:26
I would say I.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:30
Say.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:10
About what the data

Unknown Speaker  1:15:15
plant,

Unknown Speaker  1:15:20
one, I think the expense accounts are

Unknown Speaker  1:15:24
varied enough that trying to say this is the default listed. Problem is, I think we're better off to always manually.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:34
Well, I mean, I think this is okay. So what you're

Unknown Speaker  1:15:39
Yeah, what your proposal there is, I mean, if it makes sense so to do this now from an development standpoint, it does. It

Unknown Speaker  1:15:52
would.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:55
We would use it now like on all new assets

Unknown Speaker  1:15:59
creating currently. But

Unknown Speaker  1:16:04
is there a reason why this couldn't, why we couldn't do the development even before the cleanup is done? We could, well, you don't need to do,

Unknown Speaker  1:16:13
we do the development,

Unknown Speaker  1:16:15
then you need to clean up any expense accounts. Is there any kind of validation that we want on expense accounts. Like, do you want a master list of expense accounts, or certain expense accounts per class, or

Unknown Speaker  1:16:29
no, because there's

Unknown Speaker  1:16:32
typically, whoever's setting up the assets, typically is is quite knowledgeable about the accounts. So no,

Unknown Speaker  1:16:42
I so if we just leave expense accounts as is nothing else, and then we add these fields on the RG on the accounting companies that you can configure asset classes and accounts and accumulated depreciation.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:01
And then at that point, we can update accounting impact

Unknown Speaker  1:17:05
well or update not accounting whatever. No whatever gets updated. It's not accounting impact.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:13
Wouldn't you update? Or wouldn't you then pull that in. When you go to create a new asset, you say, you know, it's you bought

Unknown Speaker  1:17:23
a piece of land. So the asset type is real estate, and then it pulls in those,

Unknown Speaker  1:17:30
those two edge and

Unknown Speaker  1:17:33
then when you, when you change the accounts on a on an asset class, do you want it to update all assets in that?

Unknown Speaker  1:17:41
We're not doing that.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:46
I'm thinking, right, just just pre populating on the

Unknown Speaker  1:17:53
when you create new asset.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:56
I would actually propose to Seth, do you have it? Do you have an opinion? I would propose to put this on the asset class itself,

Unknown Speaker  1:18:03
because it's not accounting impact

Unknown Speaker  1:18:08
well, but then you need to link through accounting company to, I don't know

Unknown Speaker  1:18:14
if it matters, go ahead.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:18
Oh, because you're saying which depreciation accounts to show,

Unknown Speaker  1:18:23
yeah, we either have an RG of accounting company, plus asset account, plus accumulated depreciation.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:31
Now everything else is configured. All the other accounting stuff is configured in the accounting company. I'm going to go back to arguing for this. I don't know. Only the only reason not to have it on accounting company is what you're saying. But it's, it really is.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:48
It's not accounting impact. It's a default depreciation account. Is

Unknown Speaker  1:18:52
that right? Or is it?

Unknown Speaker  1:18:55
It is a default, yeah, the default appreciation account and the default

Unknown Speaker  1:19:00
asset account where the actual purchase is recorded. Because if we, because we're creating, we're literally, this is not assets are don't run through accounting impact. They just

Unknown Speaker  1:19:13
create. They

Unknown Speaker  1:19:16
just create the depreciation records. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:19:20
yeah. I'm also

Unknown Speaker  1:19:22
going to argue putting it in the asset you're more likely to remember to set it up in the accounting company when adding a cloud mind. I think it's fair.

Unknown Speaker  1:19:42
Did it just be like, Should we call it sound like? Let me just if you say it's a default asset account, default accumulated depreciation amount, just to make it clear,

Unknown Speaker  1:19:53
I think it's worth it.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:06
We can use share down changes.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:10
Okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:20:20
so if this is something that's easy to develop, I would prioritize quite high a bit.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:36
You

Unknown Speaker  1:20:44
Oh, then that will will show any should narrow down,

Unknown Speaker  1:20:49
yeah, your cleanup, it will be easy,

Unknown Speaker  1:20:53
theoretically,

Unknown Speaker  1:20:57
all right,

Unknown Speaker  1:20:59
Seth, delegate is this top priority of the ones

Unknown Speaker  1:21:05
I No, I put it underneath the two notch a file.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:12
Okay.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:16
Are you trying to taper off development at the beginning of the year, like we did last year or not.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:22
We said, No, we want to do a full first quarter. And so again,

Unknown Speaker  1:21:27
want to discuss with Matthias question on doing

Unknown Speaker  1:21:32
documentation. Well, let's, let's run. Are you guys good to go a little bit on the live and if, if need be here,

Unknown Speaker  1:21:39
I've got, I've got time. If you got time. Okay, yeah, we do, because we want to also cover that payroll stuff. So I'd say, let's run through the rest of this list and then talk.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:57
I think I'm gonna, I'm gonna drop off.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:00
Okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:22:01
thanks guys.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:04
Well,

Unknown Speaker  1:22:06
we have to standardize

Unknown Speaker  1:22:13
that. You sent it to them too. You sent it to Drew and he might not be in your report, asked from.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:21
But I thought I had, I thought I had kept everybody, maybe I didn't. I don't know.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:28
Okay, let's do just go after Drew. It's either to Drew or to mark. I don't remember I saw it.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:37
I don't disagree. I

Unknown Speaker  1:22:43
There you go. It's a mark.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:46
Nick is on the

Unknown Speaker  1:22:50
addition. If they're saying he doesn't catch additional, insane, it doesn't catch additional. I was trying to be clever and oh goodness,

Unknown Speaker  1:22:58
okay. I mean, it theoretically could, maybe should, but it doesn't

Unknown Speaker  1:23:04
okay. That one's done isn't the actual cost.

Unknown Speaker  1:23:09
Pretty sure, yeah, it's

Unknown Speaker  1:23:13
done. Now we have the Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:23:20
further ways we're working on that a bit. Yeah, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:23:37
That's that

Unknown Speaker  1:23:41
technical. That

Unknown Speaker  1:23:45
this is one.

Unknown Speaker  1:23:49
No, this is the removing the companies.

Unknown Speaker  1:23:52
Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:23:55
it's

Unknown Speaker  1:23:59
getting rid of Maine. Is hard.

Unknown Speaker  1:24:01
Nick started working on it, and then we stopped. None of the things came up, but it's, there's a lot of assumptions baked in that it's going to be there, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:24:13
So, I mean, if it's real difficult, I'd say we

Unknown Speaker  1:24:17
just leave it. And we got rid of Chartered accounts, right? Yeah, we did,

Unknown Speaker  1:24:25
and we're keeping

Unknown Speaker  1:24:27
the main is the only one that you would want to get rid of yet, if possible, but it's the one thing we could do. Seth,

Unknown Speaker  1:24:37
could we not

Unknown Speaker  1:24:41
active? Inactive,

Unknown Speaker  1:24:43
or what, no,

Unknown Speaker  1:24:46
what merge take to merge insight into main and,

Unknown Speaker  1:24:53
okay, you would, you would merge. You

Unknown Speaker  1:24:56
would merge insight into main and then copy all the, you know, a.

Unknown Speaker  1:25:00
Can fill in all the fields. It's just the company name, really, on the main and so main becomes insight referenced anywhere,

Unknown Speaker  1:25:09
like, are there things linked to transactions, or

Unknown Speaker  1:25:12
anything, or accounts or for purchase orders? Right now,

Unknown Speaker  1:25:20
I'm not sure that there's any transactions, but like, you use it for Kanban cars for purchasing.

Unknown Speaker  1:25:27
So no transactions.

Unknown Speaker  1:25:32
I mean, it's a look up. Can't you just do a straight up merch or

Unknown Speaker  1:25:39
what? Yeah, a little worried with the implication. Or is there any place on Kanban Cards? Do you use the is prefix? Or how does that work?

Unknown Speaker  1:25:51
I don't know. See, take a look at purchase orders and

Unknown Speaker  1:25:56
purchase orders that were purchased from i

Unknown Speaker  1:26:00
Uh,

Unknown Speaker  1:26:02
well, do we not have just for ship your location, just use insight 2020,

Unknown Speaker  1:26:11
that should get

Unknown Speaker  1:26:18
us the extent of what we use it for Wait,

Unknown Speaker  1:26:23
just as a way to send purchase orders like we're not paying the invoices in here, and eventually, hopefully next year, we'll start doing Our accounting for insight in here. But,

Unknown Speaker  1:26:42
okay, we think, I think,

Unknown Speaker  1:26:45
I'm not completely sure what breaks, but we could change your just make main be insight 2020

Unknown Speaker  1:26:54
I mean, that's, that's fine with me. I'm not really scared about,

Unknown Speaker  1:26:59
we don't have a ton of stuff tied to insight that if something does go sideways, it's not,

Unknown Speaker  1:27:06
oh, we don't allow merging.

Unknown Speaker  1:27:09
Why not? Or what?

Unknown Speaker  1:27:12
I bet we've manually disabled it,

Unknown Speaker  1:27:17
I don't know. Probably because you're scared that there's accounts and transactions and stuff, and what happens? This is all kinds of things that, well, yeah, you're sort of, you

Unknown Speaker  1:27:30
do have the chart of accounts, but this

Unknown Speaker  1:27:33
one doesn't have a chart of accounts. You'd have to what

Unknown Speaker  1:27:38
Insight has a chart of accounts?

Unknown Speaker  1:27:40
Yes, we never use it.

Unknown Speaker  1:27:43
I think it's just a generic one that get got uploaded. So if that would all be wiped out, no big deal. No big deal.

Unknown Speaker  1:27:53
We don't have any. I wish there'd be a database feature to find references to a list field.

Unknown Speaker  1:28:01
Yeah, that'd be lovely.

Unknown Speaker  1:28:05
Well, this is the type of thing I'd say. If it's something that could be done in

Unknown Speaker  1:28:11
two to three hours, let's do it. If not, let's leave it as is. So, I mean, it'd be easy enough to temporarily allow merging,

Unknown Speaker  1:28:21
even just allow it

Unknown Speaker  1:28:24
at a system switch.

Unknown Speaker  1:28:36
Yeah, you're saying turn the system switch back off again.

Unknown Speaker  1:28:41
We either do a system switch or we just temporarily loosen it up so that you can merge. You could do either way. I've explained code equals whatever. I don't care, yeah. I mean, this is,

Unknown Speaker  1:28:55
sounds like, if we go this route, it's, it's pretty quick to do, yeah, yeah. I'd say, let's just move it to high or very high, and just do it as well.

Unknown Speaker  1:29:05
It's gonna rename it to merge insight in me or something like that.

Unknown Speaker  1:29:18
Wait for me, okay? But we should also,

Unknown Speaker  1:29:22
yeah, there you go.

Unknown Speaker  1:29:29
Yep, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:29:31
you'll get to keep your Chart of Accounts, I think. So, I mean, not that you care, but

Unknown Speaker  1:29:38
Okay, actually, go use I want to mix a whole bunch of stuff,

Unknown Speaker  1:29:48
company selections to replace all this one seems to me like it's going to take a little bit of spec time from oh well, Josh once

Unknown Speaker  1:29:56
talked about background, but

Unknown Speaker  1:29:59
I.

Unknown Speaker  1:30:00
A little bit of specking, but this could be a really good job for Sean and Jasper to just plug away at.

Unknown Speaker  1:30:08
So are we seeing it does still need some spake from Josh.

Unknown Speaker  1:30:13
I think it requires me to ask Josh why he wanted me to talk to him, and then I can go spec it and hand it off. Nick spec it. Honestly. Can we maybe this is not the right place, but could we also add we'll want to change. We mentioned this to Josh, and maybe this, we want to change the name affordable barn company to Newhouse outdoors as well. Would this be the place to do that or not? I mean, Josh,

Unknown Speaker  1:30:46
when we as I recall, Josh said, you know, you have to think about it, but it basically

Unknown Speaker  1:30:55
be not a fine and replace, but I think to that effect, just everywhere we're referencing it. I mean, literally, in Josh's court.

Unknown Speaker  1:31:05
What isn't it?

Unknown Speaker  1:31:10
It's this,

Unknown Speaker  1:31:15
okay. I mean, that's the company. Are there other references and then? But I mean, for this part of it. I don't know about Josh. I'm nervous about anything Josh has with affordable barn company with there's some literal dealer name matches. Dealer name is match builder. I don't know what I

Unknown Speaker  1:31:33
I would do.

Unknown Speaker  1:31:35
Yeah. So is your thought.

Unknown Speaker  1:31:38
Seth takes care of this, and then create a separate incident with Josh to change the name. Yeah, what I would do? I mean, you guys can immediately, you'll break some favorites if you get favorites that reference. I

Unknown Speaker  1:31:52
want to look at what the Edit company actually does. I'm not convinced it's going to handle

Unknown Speaker  1:32:00
everything we have linked out. It's just for have it up. It's just editing

Unknown Speaker  1:32:07
the prefix and account names, part of account name, accounting periods, things like that. So no, we're fine. It's a list field. It'll just update.

Unknown Speaker  1:32:17
So

Unknown Speaker  1:32:19
is there a way we could use, should we be using Edit?

Unknown Speaker  1:32:23
We can run the Edit over here.

Unknown Speaker  1:32:31
Main I mean, shouldn't we write up a incident for this other one?

Unknown Speaker  1:32:37
Or not? This doesn't really matter. I

Unknown Speaker  1:32:44
you.

Unknown Speaker  1:32:57
I see

Unknown Speaker  1:33:00
Sorry. Write up an incident

Unknown Speaker  1:33:05
for what for the changing from affordable barn to new Haas

Unknown Speaker  1:33:10
he that would be in Josh's court, which is not in here.

Unknown Speaker  1:33:16
Okay, if you tell me that's in Josh's court, I'll just write up an incident for Josh, and then you can companies drop dead simple to change,

Unknown Speaker  1:33:26
but you're saying, like the

Unknown Speaker  1:33:29
what's going to happen to the Chart of Account prefixes and the Purchase Order? That's you literally just purchase order? Yes, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:33:44
We can update the account, the accounting side of things, I'm pretty confident it won't break anything in the system,

Unknown Speaker  1:33:52
renaming builders, dealers,

Unknown Speaker  1:33:56
districts, anything like that. I have no idea, and that's the question for Josh.

Unknown Speaker  1:34:04
You would just, we just, we don't change the accounting company name either. We just let Josh do that at the same time he does. You can

Unknown Speaker  1:34:11
change it whenever you want. So that will make so that what vendor invoices, purchase orders, the name will change on all of those.

Unknown Speaker  1:34:21
No,

Unknown Speaker  1:34:24
vendor invoices still pull names off of

Unknown Speaker  1:34:31
like the build to shed time there while we're I mean, no, it's not.

Unknown Speaker  1:34:38
No, it

Unknown Speaker  1:34:40
doesn't. We're pulling it off. The bill to district

Unknown Speaker  1:34:45
the build, yeah, it wouldn't change.

Unknown Speaker  1:34:49
Pos wouldn't, I'm pretty sure po account

Unknown Speaker  1:34:53
even there for to get the company

Unknown Speaker  1:34:58
that's, yeah, that's the building company.

Unknown Speaker  1:35:00
That wouldn't change.

Unknown Speaker  1:35:02
I mean, the accounting side would work fine, but it like the vendor and stuff would still Right, right? Or am I, yeah, you would, you would still vendor. Would still show the old name, that's Josh's court. But anytime you would search in accounting, you would use the new prefix that, if we switch this over to replace district selections, then the new ones would use new house instead of Ohio.

Unknown Speaker  1:35:34
So I still really come out anyway, what are you suggesting that we do? Like, are you suggesting you edit the accounting company name like right away, and then let then

Unknown Speaker  1:35:45
we create an incident for Josh to do the rest of

Unknown Speaker  1:35:52
the work.

Unknown Speaker  1:35:53
Yeah, that's

Unknown Speaker  1:35:57
it. The only thing that matters

Unknown Speaker  1:36:00
is really from a change management, management perspective, from you guys,

Unknown Speaker  1:36:04
you'd rather wait until Josh is closer rolling out his affordable barn, rename

Unknown Speaker  1:36:09
then. That's fine. Wait until then, just because I could see a lot of confusion coming being renamed some places. So

Unknown Speaker  1:36:19
okay, I'll create an incident for that

Unknown Speaker  1:36:25
remittance email link.

Unknown Speaker  1:36:33
Okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:36:36
what does AP need for the remittance email look up?

Unknown Speaker  1:36:42
Made? Okay. We said, well, we need to go back and ask or see. How often do they actually get calls from vendors, and how are they handling that? So

Unknown Speaker  1:36:58
we send that to you, and you just work with, say, Dwayne, figure out, I mean, I mean, yeah, we could,

Unknown Speaker  1:37:07
this is just about, it's a nice little

Unknown Speaker  1:37:11
button for them to find the email that was actually sent right, yeah? Because right now we don't have an easy if, if a vendor calls Dwayne's office and says, Hey, we never got that.

Unknown Speaker  1:37:23
Never got the money on this invoice. So they have a way to say, Well, okay, looking at your invoice, we issued an ACH payment on this day. Here's the details, same as they would for a check. But I guess we're kind of, maybe, you know, Drew, but I think we need to go ask the question, Well, are they getting any of those calls? Are they, like, same way with with a check? Or, do you know, are they handling that some, I mean, sometimes they'll just say,

Unknown Speaker  1:37:51
I mean, there's, I don't know, once or twice a month, I'll get an email from them saying,

Unknown Speaker  1:37:59
hey vendors wondering about this payment, and we show it paid.

Unknown Speaker  1:38:04
Oh, so, like, assist says it was paid. Well, so then the only thing that is just basically to go straight to the bank and figure out if it actually went through or didn't, or so, like, I mean, if they're saying, well, we didn't get a remittance email, you know that in that case, it would be nice. I mean, or is this something where we should just pull it out? I think

Unknown Speaker  1:38:31
if we want to do something, and what else suggested of just doing blind carbon copy, email, I think that would be the nice. It's pretty sane, as long as they don't mind, like, suddenly getting nailed with a whole bunch of

Unknown Speaker  1:38:47
emails. But

Unknown Speaker  1:38:50
let's do that that fakes, and if they mind, then we'll do Yeah, and they can always

Unknown Speaker  1:38:57
put it into have it automatically go into sub folder or something like, it's not that bad, right?

Unknown Speaker  1:39:04
So this email address, do we want to make it a setting? Yeah, well, is it?

Unknown Speaker  1:39:11
Is it? Can we make it okay? County, an accounting company setting that says where, remittance, email, BCC,

Unknown Speaker  1:39:22
and then NACHA good in the NACHA section, perfect, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:39:26
yeah, yeah, there we go. Look at that. Can

Unknown Speaker  1:39:34
you

Unknown Speaker  1:39:37
write the email send for?

Unknown Speaker  1:39:40
Yeah?

Unknown Speaker  1:39:44
And then three months down the road, we'll come back. It's like, Oh, this one's waiting on Drew. Is there

Unknown Speaker  1:39:55
an email address that you'd want to use for all of them right away? Well, it.

Unknown Speaker  1:40:00
What is it? Accounts Payable? Dash abc, yeah, it's just,

Unknown Speaker  1:40:06
it's accounts payable. Dash abc, at email, by fax.com, believe, I think so. Is that for that's for affordable and then the other two are just st and vs or ABCs, okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:40:20
I don't want to email them.

Unknown Speaker  1:40:23
Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:40:27
yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:40:33
there we go.

Unknown Speaker  1:40:40
Didn't mean

Unknown Speaker  1:40:43
to, mean to delete all I did not want to delete I wanted to actually have a clipboard manager.

Unknown Speaker  1:40:49
I do actually. Why would I use that? I don't know. I

Unknown Speaker  1:41:13
Okay, yeah, this

Unknown Speaker  1:41:16
is quick and easy, doing it up in the very high too, just to knock out with all the other little stuff, or doing it somewhere else.

Unknown Speaker  1:41:22
Yeah, it's good. Just, let's just knock it out.

Unknown Speaker  1:41:28
RMV report issue we looked at VI paid.

Unknown Speaker  1:41:36
So

Unknown Speaker  1:41:41
well you shouldn't be able to market unpaid if you have a payment date and amount.

Unknown Speaker  1:41:58
Yeah, actually, this may have gone away because it was prepaid, unverified.

Unknown Speaker  1:42:05
We inactivated, no, we inactivated that one.

Unknown Speaker  1:42:10
But there's still if somebody could, currently, somebody could go in and mark

Unknown Speaker  1:42:16
this unpaid, right or on, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:42:21
Okay. But if I do that, I don't know if I want to do this.

Unknown Speaker  1:42:27
Let's do I'm

Unknown Speaker  1:42:30
slightly paranoid, rightly or wrongly.

Unknown Speaker  1:42:40
Okay? So if we do,

Unknown Speaker  1:42:43
yes, we know that's what we want to do. I mean, we could just say that. It seems saying to me that you can't have, okay, let's also check this then

Unknown Speaker  1:43:01
you can't have paid. I know that already stops you from saying paid without having paid date, without having it in there.

Unknown Speaker  1:43:30
These are all older ones.

Unknown Speaker  1:43:32
Let's

Unknown Speaker  1:43:34
reverse. Let's just take this grouping out.

Unknown Speaker  1:43:37
Actually, no, this is by this

Unknown Speaker  1:43:40
is by year. I mean, we don't have any since 2023 that would

Unknown Speaker  1:43:47
well, these are, these are all.

Unknown Speaker  1:43:51
These are all paid without that. Okay, so let's look where it's

Unknown Speaker  1:43:56
it's not paid

Unknown Speaker  1:43:59
and

Unknown Speaker  1:44:01
we have a payment date or amount, we don't have an A. Is an A? Your subsets wrong?

Unknown Speaker  1:44:10
Is an A, or is an A?

Unknown Speaker  1:44:12
Right? Oh, no,

Unknown Speaker  1:44:15
I see, I see, and we have a payment date or we have a payment amount, yeah, no, you're right.

Unknown Speaker  1:44:23
There were the negatives in there.

Unknown Speaker  1:44:27
Yeah, right. Can we get more?

Unknown Speaker  1:44:33
I would, I mean, I'm

Unknown Speaker  1:44:36
the reason we need to be worried, from a Josh perspective, about this one.

Unknown Speaker  1:44:40
Probably we make it a warning.

Unknown Speaker  1:44:46
So

Unknown Speaker  1:44:48
what your suggestion is to

Unknown Speaker  1:44:52
what turn it read only, if

Unknown Speaker  1:44:56
we can't just turn it real, we probably don't want to just turn it read only.

Unknown Speaker  1:45:00
Of the payment amount, if it has a payment date and the payment amount matches the

Unknown Speaker  1:45:06
total at the top, think

Unknown Speaker  1:45:10
it'd be, wouldn't it be better to do validation?

Unknown Speaker  1:45:14
Yeah, either a warning or an error.

Unknown Speaker  1:45:18
I like that, because, depending on what happens with credit memo payments that wouldn't wouldn't hold? Yeah, it wouldn't work very well.

Unknown Speaker  1:45:29
Your V invoice balance for payment, I do wonder about this.

Unknown Speaker  1:45:50
If it's no that doesn't match. If it's not paid, I

Unknown Speaker  1:45:56
should want to check if it's paid and developed. Yeah, that's the same thing

Unknown Speaker  1:46:03
if the balance is zero, but

Unknown Speaker  1:46:06
it's not paid.

Unknown Speaker  1:46:08
Oh, I see

Unknown Speaker  1:46:12
it's working differently than mine this morning.

Unknown Speaker  1:46:16
Okay, well, that doesn't mean that's good. I think getting rid of the prepaid unverified made a lot of it go away.

Unknown Speaker  1:46:26
I mean, like the right trouble we were having.

Unknown Speaker  1:46:32
I mean, okay, here's I would be very happy that Warren, if

Unknown Speaker  1:46:38
paid

Unknown Speaker  1:46:59
just give a Warning if you have this information specified, but you don't have

Unknown Speaker  1:47:04
but this is marked wrong.

Unknown Speaker  1:47:10
Well, there's already validation that stops you from saying unpaid. If there's a date, I'm pretty sure,

Unknown Speaker  1:47:18
no, there's validation that stops you from saying it's paid without the amounts. Oh, okay, yeah, that's right. That's right.

Unknown Speaker  1:47:28
Now we're wanting validation to say the other way usual, and

Unknown Speaker  1:47:39
it is an error. Okay. Well, that makes me pretty happy. Validate,

Unknown Speaker  1:47:45
validate, if it's paid.

Unknown Speaker  1:48:01
Good,

Unknown Speaker  1:48:03
yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:48:05
this is also a relatively quick one, but I don't know how, how much fast stuff you want to push through.

Unknown Speaker  1:48:12
I mean, I'd say just add it to the stack or the pile of little stuff that we have.

Unknown Speaker  1:48:19
Okay, so that takes us through the mediums now, yeah, so I'd say, let's go back and now try to put some priority to them there. There is one more that I'm not seeing on this list that I had made for some drop down filtering,

Unknown Speaker  1:48:36
but I don't know. Do

Unknown Speaker  1:48:40
you know what it has to do with deposit with credit memos drop down for credit memos on deposits?

Unknown Speaker  1:48:50
Oh, I remember seeing that somewhere. Maybe that small grievances, I'm pretty sure. Yeah. Um,

Unknown Speaker  1:48:58
well, let's start by doing this. Um, selecting

Unknown Speaker  1:49:04
a credit memo payment on deposits is not filtered

Unknown Speaker  1:49:11
like it shows all the credit memos instead of only those that are assigned for the wait for deposit.

Unknown Speaker  1:49:19
I don't have that's,

Unknown Speaker  1:49:22
it's, yeah, the link is old. Now accounting,

Unknown Speaker  1:49:30
you're just gonna want to do a new

Unknown Speaker  1:49:36
you can manually mess at the URL if you want to. But

Unknown Speaker  1:49:41
why do it the easy way when you can do the hard way? Come on. All right, so the credit memos,

Unknown Speaker  1:49:49
so these should write

Unknown Speaker  1:49:52
selected,

Unknown Speaker  1:49:56
just wait for deposit and do not have a zero balance remaining. I.

Unknown Speaker  1:50:05
I mean, fundamentally, this is,

Unknown Speaker  1:50:10
like, that one should not be showing,

Unknown Speaker  1:50:14
like, there's probably none that should be showing, right? And

Unknown Speaker  1:50:19
then we're gonna have to hit the

Unknown Speaker  1:50:23
okay. I'm

Unknown Speaker  1:50:43
you were saying you went vendor,

Unknown Speaker  1:50:48
or was this,

Unknown Speaker  1:50:51
yeah, vendor

Unknown Speaker  1:50:55
balance, or the amount

Unknown Speaker  1:50:58
the

Unknown Speaker  1:51:00
um,

Unknown Speaker  1:51:03
probably balance remaining.

Unknown Speaker  1:51:08
I It will probably almost never be different, but from the amount. But anyway, I

Unknown Speaker  1:51:25
and then,

Unknown Speaker  1:51:30
and you don't need the you don't need the credit memo, the ID,

Unknown Speaker  1:51:35
not the date. I mean, you could put that on at the end, but soon it's long, like

Unknown Speaker  1:51:43
the vendor name and the amount of the credit memo are definitely more important.

Unknown Speaker  1:51:54
Okay, this is also going to be highly delegatable.

Unknown Speaker  1:51:58
There's one other list that I'll if we're, if we're fixing drop lists, and add to it, and that's the vendor invoice meeting, payment, Payment Type drop list.

Unknown Speaker  1:52:14
Yeah, there. Then if

Unknown Speaker  1:52:17
we could at least filter to only the active

Unknown Speaker  1:52:22
or I don't know if filtering by the district selection works degrees.

Unknown Speaker  1:52:29
No, we can't do that, okay, but if we just unfortunately, that would work, yeah? Should we switch to accounting company instead of district if we're in here anyway, yeah? Or should I guess that could also just happen at the whole big job. But

Unknown Speaker  1:52:44
why can't you do if you do it to accounting company, you could easily filter the payment type list? No, a drop list can't depend on another job, or can't depend on another as prompt, one of the two

Unknown Speaker  1:52:57
we've run into this before.

Unknown Speaker  1:53:00
I thought droplets can depend on other droplets, but no, it's because of the ballooning size that there is some guarantee stuff into it,

Unknown Speaker  1:53:08
yeah, but I'll get accounts receivable report, I think.

Unknown Speaker  1:53:13
But just active, just only the active, would reduce it to probably a fifth of the size.

Unknown Speaker  1:53:20
I We and there's a lot that look like duplicates and so then,

Unknown Speaker  1:53:28
yeah, new people don't know

Unknown Speaker  1:53:31
what's possible.

Unknown Speaker  1:53:33
That's a sign of growth that we

Unknown Speaker  1:53:36
went from all those

Unknown Speaker  1:53:38
account or payment types and

Unknown Speaker  1:53:42
a lot of them are actually from way back when we weren't even using it, and it was more just a method of saying, you know, what should Whitney use to pay this over on her

Unknown Speaker  1:53:57
great

Unknown Speaker  1:54:01
All right. Now we're ready to prioritize.

Unknown Speaker  1:54:06
Okay, so Well, except for the Go ahead,

Unknown Speaker  1:54:10
well, okay, let's ignore the little stuff and just focus on what I mean. There's not a lot of

Unknown Speaker  1:54:20
Is there anything in high that's,

Unknown Speaker  1:54:26
or indeed, I mean, that's, that's not just part of the quick

Unknown Speaker  1:54:32
little the payroll thing set a summary here. I wanted to be able to throw in. I'm

Unknown Speaker  1:54:41
just going to do this,

Unknown Speaker  1:54:48
Aaron stuff for the payroll. Yeah, there's another payroll incident as well. Oh, we wanted to look at the accounting

Unknown Speaker  1:54:56
impact you had built out Matthias, right? I.

Unknown Speaker  1:55:00
With the quick which that's probably also Yeah, QuickBooks stuff that the QuickBooks one is assigned to Aaron. I think,

Unknown Speaker  1:55:10
do we want to look at the payroll stuff now before we prioritize

Unknown Speaker  1:55:14
Aaron's available? If we Yeah, I mean, that's fine. Oh yeah, you guys are so good on time. Yeah, we're good. I had a whole bunch of cancelations today, so,

Unknown Speaker  1:55:40
oh,

Unknown Speaker  1:55:49
go Ahead, that's

Unknown Speaker  1:55:51
just some.

Unknown Speaker  1:55:55
Hi guys.

Unknown Speaker  1:55:58
Aaron,

Unknown Speaker  1:56:01
how are you

Unknown Speaker  1:56:03
good? How are you doing? Oh, pretty well, trying to stay warm. Yeah, stay warm. Stay inside. That's, that's what I hear. Not too

Unknown Speaker  1:56:14
bad today, but they're predicting for some pretty cold stuff the way it sounds. Yeah, yep, yep,

Unknown Speaker  1:56:22
all right. Seth, do you want to? Do you want to share screen and drive? Or do you want what's good

Unknown Speaker  1:56:29
enough that matters too much in the incident

Unknown Speaker  1:56:32
should all be in here.

Unknown Speaker  1:56:35
We so we add

Unknown Speaker  1:56:38
on the was it? On the was it company payroll verification that we were showing actual incentive pool, and then an adjustment

Unknown Speaker  1:56:49
we have, and you were wondering if we could have a way to manually adjust the pool. We essentially have that already on the builder record.

Unknown Speaker  1:57:01
If I see, if you open a builder record,

Unknown Speaker  1:57:05
is it the frozen I think it was right, yeah, yeah. I had a screenshot of it, but at the bottom here

Unknown Speaker  1:57:18
is, this is essentially, this is how we calculate the pool. So I think if we want to add an adjustment, it makes the most sense. We could add a column in here to just say how much you want to adjust it by, and

Unknown Speaker  1:57:31
then it would adjust it

Unknown Speaker  1:57:34
based off of, I mean, like right now, it would be at zero, but if you'd adjusted then it would keep showing that adjustment amount

Unknown Speaker  1:57:45
from what it would have been. Are you saying, like a column just to the right of the incentive pool, and if you want to add, for whatever reason, $500 to the pool, you just enter 500 into the Yeah, but it would keep showing 500 it would it just be calculating based off of what the original pool would have been compared to what the frozen production is, which is what we calculate our pool

Unknown Speaker  1:58:08
off of. So the you would keep the the $9,006

Unknown Speaker  1:58:12
and then go minus 500 and then you'd add another column

Unknown Speaker  1:58:17
for the the No, I was thinking,

Unknown Speaker  1:58:21
I mean, we can add a column in here to say what the incentive pool would have been if, without the frozen production, like, based on the actual column.

Unknown Speaker  1:58:32
Well, yeah, you wouldn't need the would you need the two columns, just one column

Unknown Speaker  1:58:38
for the the adjustment.

Unknown Speaker  1:58:41
I believe that's all so, yeah, I mean, you can do it right now, like, if you want the pool to be smaller, you can literally go edit it right here, change it to 8500 or something,

Unknown Speaker  1:58:51
and it'll automatically, it takes it a tiny, a little bit there, but it just it adjusts production. If we want.

Unknown Speaker  1:59:02
We could also add a field that's just a manual adjustment that doesn't adjust the production. If we need to do that,

Unknown Speaker  1:59:10
that's, that's what, what we're wanting, I believe. Because, okay, the the use case for this is, is simply,

Unknown Speaker  1:59:18
okay, so, so it's only, it's mainly used in Ohio, where we have,

Unknown Speaker  1:59:25
so we have two production facilities near, near each other. And occasionally,

Unknown Speaker  1:59:30
well, almost every week,

Unknown Speaker  1:59:34
an employee will driver, yeah, yeah. We'll spend some of his time at the other population.

Unknown Speaker  1:59:40
So yeah, like a driver for maybe an on site. And so if, if, because

Unknown Speaker  1:59:49
an employer that's listed on ABC to payroll and his hours are there, if he spends four days at the other location and makes their production

Unknown Speaker  1:59:59
that much more.

Unknown Speaker  2:00:00
More than those guys get paid unfairly, because they get they get paid too much

Unknown Speaker  2:00:06
because they had an extra guy, yeah, yeah, not pulling out of the pool. So yeah, what we're doing is we're saying, Well, okay, the pool needs to be shrunk by this amount, and then we do Sure. Okay, then I think it does make sense to just add a field that would be an adjust, a manual adjustment about I wasn't quite tracking and what you were needing. Do these notes show up on the report?

Unknown Speaker  2:00:29
I think I

Unknown Speaker  2:00:31
remember where they show up. They show up on at least some of them. I don't think they're currently used at all. You definitely want to show those as well, so Jr can

Unknown Speaker  2:00:39
adjust by this amount. And the reason was so many hours for this guy. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  2:00:46
help with this. Let me

Unknown Speaker  2:00:48
just checking to see where it's used. But what you're saying, Aaron, is what, what we've decided on, is we don't necessarily need to show the total.

Unknown Speaker  2:00:56
Okay, how would that be displayed on the I think we're good here. How would it be displayed on the the notes are on the owner, payroll verification

Unknown Speaker  2:01:07
right now. I don't know if that's enough or not, and I think we want to see them on the company as well. Yeah. I think we should now go to the company payroll verification report, like maybe one for last week, and

Unknown Speaker  2:01:20
see,

Unknown Speaker  2:01:22
yeah.

Unknown Speaker  2:01:32
So would we add a field here?

Unknown Speaker  2:01:36
I think it'd be,

Unknown Speaker  2:01:40
it's, it's really similar. Sorry, I had somebody swing by the office. But isn't this very similar to the labor intensive building adjustment,

Unknown Speaker  2:01:49
isn't it almost Well, you said he's using that right now. We are. It could just be, I think it should be right below labor intensive. So it's a the pool. It the pool subtotal is 9006

Unknown Speaker  2:02:03
and then take out the labor intensive. We take out the adjustment. Well, it could be plus or minus, right? I think, I think you want it plus or minus your adjustment is. It could go either way, right? I think it should, should on the company, right? I would rename the notes to adjustment notes, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  2:02:25
yeah, good point.

Unknown Speaker  2:02:36
Then you subtotal if, but we could put the amount in the same column as all the other mounts and the notes. Could just take the two, the two cells off to the right, we can merge them and pop it in there, well, or even just this single cell.

Unknown Speaker  2:02:49
How big are the notes going to be? Yeah, you're saying the notes to the right, yeah, yeah, that's fine. You have to sell Oh, those guys. Yeah, yeah, it doesn't. We might as well just throw them over there

Unknown Speaker  2:03:04
too on the left side. Oh, that's right.

Unknown Speaker  2:03:10
I like my

Unknown Speaker  2:03:12
idea.

Unknown Speaker  2:03:17
Okay, and so that would, but the calculation, so by adding that or subtracting it, let's say we add by, we would add 500 here, so then we'd have 9095

Unknown Speaker  2:03:28
30.

Unknown Speaker  2:03:29
And then your hourly rate, your your incentive pool bonus pay hourly rate would increase a little bit based off, yeah, like, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  2:03:42
Good,

Unknown Speaker  2:03:43
good. I think is that all on the terminology, or were there other questions on this? I mean, I think that was it for here.

Unknown Speaker  2:03:54
Okay, then I'm back. Matthias, do you want to add a note to make sure we have this on both owner and Company? Sure?

Unknown Speaker  2:04:05
Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  2:04:08
I mean, it's the only thing that and this is being really critical here. It seems like

Unknown Speaker  2:04:16
we're going all the way back to the builder. It's kind of like these adjustments are kind of buried deep within,

Unknown Speaker  2:04:23
almost like in the wrong place. But I mean, it's, it's, it's

Unknown Speaker  2:04:28
probably the right place to put them. Where else would you store it? It has to be the builder, because the pool is or the builder we yeah, we give you a report to edit the pools, and we could show you a report of the pools by builder, and then you could see them all at once. No,

Unknown Speaker  2:04:47
I mean, Seth,

Unknown Speaker  2:04:51
where else? No, this is funny. I

Unknown Speaker  2:04:56
think, I think this is the right place to store. I don't I think what.

Unknown Speaker  2:05:00
Matthias is saying it's fair. If we, if you want it more accessible, we can easily add a report. But what

Unknown Speaker  2:05:11
was the other

Unknown Speaker  2:05:17
night? Aaron has

Unknown Speaker  2:05:20
a night Aaron has the hardest time finding Aaron's name in drop list. It always speaks keys past it, like it goes to accounts receivable if I hit a twice,

Unknown Speaker  2:05:32
yeah.

Unknown Speaker  2:05:36
Oh, is this change? Like? What? How big is this easy to do? Quite a bit.

Unknown Speaker  2:05:47
I have Sean working on it. It's not, I don't think it's terrible.

Unknown Speaker  2:05:51
So a week or two.

Unknown Speaker  2:05:54
No, nothing, no, nowhere close to that. Much like as in, we can the

Unknown Speaker  2:06:00
name, because most of this is already done.

Unknown Speaker  2:06:03
Perfect. Yeah, Sean is doing a little bit to make the date stuff work. Sorry,

Unknown Speaker  2:06:10
the names are lined up, or should be at least

Unknown Speaker  2:06:14
perfect. So I

Unknown Speaker  2:06:17
don't know if you want to assign it back to you or Sean, or you could assign it back to me,

Unknown Speaker  2:06:24
I spend more time in here than Sean does.

Unknown Speaker  2:06:29
So then Matthias, do you want to show what you had for accounting impact? Weren't you having some questions with how account stuff gets mapped? I just want to Yeah. Let me go take a look at where this was.

Unknown Speaker  2:06:41
Yes, I did throw it in here.

Unknown Speaker  2:06:49
Okay, this might be a little

Unknown Speaker  2:06:53
Okay.

Unknown Speaker  2:06:55
What was my payroll liabilities?

Unknown Speaker  2:07:01
And

Unknown Speaker  2:07:06
do, how do payroll

Unknown Speaker  2:07:11
was looking at the spreadsheet. How do payroll liabilities? Do all payroll liabilities get put in the same account, or do they get split out based on the liability expense?

Unknown Speaker  2:07:23
No, they they all get put to the same payroll liabilities account, I believe.

Unknown Speaker  2:07:32
But we have to expense them out,

Unknown Speaker  2:07:36
don't we? Okay? But when you

Unknown Speaker  2:07:40
Okay, when you expense them out the expense side is is split up, same as the labor, like, the same percentage if a person works in multiple departments, or it's split across multiple departments.

Unknown Speaker  2:07:56
So,

Unknown Speaker  2:08:00
so don't we so? And then this was the question we were running into currently

Unknown Speaker  2:08:06
we have,

Unknown Speaker  2:08:12
I mean, okay, so there's we could just do what we've always done, and for every employee, also specify the

Unknown Speaker  2:08:20
Payroll Expense, the liability expense account or the payroll liability expense account. That sounds weird, but whatever

Unknown Speaker  2:08:30
as well, that seems to me like we're going to run into the same issues that we had with asset classes, where, unless you're paying really close attention, you're going to expense it the liability side out to the taxes out and insurance out to the wrong place. So shouldn't we?

Unknown Speaker  2:08:53
So what are options? Options would be,

Unknown Speaker  2:08:59
you have basically employee

Unknown Speaker  2:09:04
work codes or something that you map out on the accounting company and say, this is sales, this is

Unknown Speaker  2:09:13
Office, is production, or, you know, any number of those things. Or we could on the on the accounting company, we could say any direct labor expense to this account, you should take the liabilities out of the tax and insurance you should expense to this other account. Do

Unknown Speaker  2:09:31
you guys have a preference how that gets handled?

Unknown Speaker  2:09:36
Oh, I see. Well, okay, can you open this?

Unknown Speaker  2:09:41
Did we send a spreadsheet of the actual I think it

Unknown Speaker  2:09:45
is

Unknown Speaker  2:09:46
there. You can see the mapping that that we've been using, and what I would suggest we use.

Unknown Speaker  2:09:53
Wow, it's not, yeah, that would be the mapping. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  2:10:02
Okay, I

Unknown Speaker  2:10:23
Yeah. So if you go to the

Unknown Speaker  2:10:26
first

Unknown Speaker  2:10:29
Yeah, so up at the top, you'll see this is not super helpful, but so you've got direct labor, indirect labor, and then to the right of that, you've got payroll taxes and insurance. So what we're doing there

Unknown Speaker  2:10:43
is, so we have two we have

Unknown Speaker  2:10:48
we have two labor accounts, and we're mapping both of those

Unknown Speaker  2:10:54
payroll liabilities to that like you'll, you'll see that throughout where you have,

Unknown Speaker  2:11:00
I think you have sales management wages

Unknown Speaker  2:11:03
or sales wages support wages, and maybe

Unknown Speaker  2:11:07
sales management wages and those are all.

Unknown Speaker  2:11:11
We have a payroll taxes and insurance

Unknown Speaker  2:11:15
account within each, say, department, if that makes sense, right?

Unknown Speaker  2:11:22
Right, got it. And so the first two are the the first two are the labor this. And then whenever you see payroll and taxes, it's for the the

Unknown Speaker  2:11:30
ones to prior, yeah, up until the next payroll and taxes or Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  2:11:38
So I think

Unknown Speaker  2:11:45
and there's a bet, yeah, here's a better well, unless they're not used, unless we have nothing. But yeah, this, this shows you the same order. Here the mapping, whatever. If you were to start from the top, like,

Unknown Speaker  2:11:59
no, that's the one without formulas.

Unknown Speaker  2:12:04
Yeah, that one shows all the formulas.

Unknown Speaker  2:12:08
Looks like some of them aren't working. Somebody wrote it. This is I pulled it up in Excel, libre office. I'm sure it would behave.

Unknown Speaker  2:12:18
So one question as well. Then,

Unknown Speaker  2:12:23
how do you differentiate between

Unknown Speaker  2:12:29
which are deductible expenses, employee paid versus company paid to determine your payroll liability?

Unknown Speaker  2:12:40
If you go to the list on the first sheet, there's a list.

Unknown Speaker  2:12:45
Well, okay, I mean, just looking at this, you where it says company.

Unknown Speaker  2:12:51
That's not like if the payroll item ends with company, that means, right, equity versus employee. But then you've got federal unemployment, which, there's nothing there. I mean, what? The way we were actually doing that was, if you go to the right, there's a lookup table.

Unknown Speaker  2:13:10
Yeah, I think Matthias. Don't we store that? Shouldn't we just store down a payroll item?

Unknown Speaker  2:13:16
Right? Labor, expense, payroll and taxes, expense, payroll liabilities and payroll taxes. Yes, I get it, but employees and the liabilities there,

Unknown Speaker  2:13:31
and when they're both liabilities,

Unknown Speaker  2:13:35
whether company or they're going to hit the same liability

Unknown Speaker  2:13:40
account, the liability side is, yeah, it's the expense side that

Unknown Speaker  2:13:45
employees liabilities are part of the wages expense,

Unknown Speaker  2:13:50
whereas expenses,

Unknown Speaker  2:13:56
Hang on, just take that 222 paces slower.

Unknown Speaker  2:14:03
So the we're liable for, for employee and company portion, the the is

Unknown Speaker  2:14:09
it

Unknown Speaker  2:14:15
correct to say drew that the if the payment amount that's shown here

Unknown Speaker  2:14:22
is, is what the employee gets paid, less his portion of the liability

Unknown Speaker  2:14:32
payment amount. They're showing where? Well, if we

Unknown Speaker  2:14:35
from the QuickBooks files, like, if we go all the way over to, let's say, oh, like, the actual check to him, yeah? Like, if we take Adam Miller here, for example, the what is the payroll amount at the top is eight. It's like 840,

Unknown Speaker  2:14:51
plus the the overtime of 369,

Unknown Speaker  2:14:55
which would be, yeah, that's going to be as gross or the wage base the two.

Unknown Speaker  2:15:00
1209, that's his gross pay,

Unknown Speaker  2:15:04
which is, is, but then all of his liabilities,

Unknown Speaker  2:15:13
the payroll, the thing hitting the taken off of that for his payment, amount,

Unknown Speaker  2:15:20
the amount hitting the the payroll liabilities,

Unknown Speaker  2:15:24
liability account would be the company portion, correct?

Unknown Speaker  2:15:29
No, that's all of them.

Unknown Speaker  2:15:32
That's what liability expense is. Only right portion.

Unknown Speaker  2:15:38
Sorry, it's only the which the

Unknown Speaker  2:15:41
company portion. So right, in case, right? We're going to Adam's going to be paid $980

Unknown Speaker  2:15:51
the sell T, right, whatever. That's what he's going to be paid, which is 1209, his wage base, minus all of his liabilities,

Unknown Speaker  2:16:03
but the company's still responsible for

Unknown Speaker  2:16:08
like the what

Unknown Speaker  2:16:11
are the company expenses, like Medicare company The 1753

Unknown Speaker  2:16:16
whereas the 1753 That

Unknown Speaker  2:16:19
for employee, is hmm,

Unknown Speaker  2:16:41
mean,

Unknown Speaker  2:16:42
so your original gross pay is your wage expense.

Unknown Speaker  2:16:49
That would be the debit credit is his liability portion,

Unknown Speaker  2:16:56
and the check that we write to him make up his gross pay, yep, and then the company wage, the company liabilities.

Unknown Speaker  2:17:10
We debit the expense for that, and the credit is then the liability account,

Unknown Speaker  2:17:18
the payroll liability. Eventually we hit the checking account with the credit again and pay for both that, which is typically what, like the the tax or the government entities that are paid at the bottom of this payroll file, which, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  2:17:36
yeah, come out about a week later, but as a lump sum of all the employees from the previous week,

Unknown Speaker  2:17:42
right?

Unknown Speaker  2:17:45
Okay, that makes sense.

Unknown Speaker  2:17:49
Are you keeping liability expenses in a separate account from the wage expenses

Unknown Speaker  2:17:57
we are in payroll taxes and insurance? Okay, okay, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  2:18:05
yeah, so, so we can see, like on the expense accounts, let's say sales, sales wages, the sales wage

Unknown Speaker  2:18:15
is just their gross pay.

Unknown Speaker  2:18:17
Yeah, that should be their gross pay, and then the payroll taxation insurance is the additional portion of the company pays. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  2:18:25
so Matthias, what fields are you going to reference like from the QuickBooks files to determine like? Are you thinking the I mean, I know that the payroll items field is fairly consistent. Are you thinking to reference something else? Yeah?

Unknown Speaker  2:18:45
It's a quick book payroll items there. So what we're going to do on here is add a setting, probably a if

Unknown Speaker  2:18:54
it's a liability, we might actually have a payroll liability. Two

Unknown Speaker  2:19:01
payroll liabilities, one's employee paid one's one's

Unknown Speaker  2:19:07
company paid.

Unknown Speaker  2:19:09
Payroll liability, paid by company. Payroll liability

Unknown Speaker  2:19:14
paid by employee. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  2:19:27
and does that, I mean, does that make sense?

Unknown Speaker  2:19:30
Yeah, it, it does. And so when we, if occasion, we'll get a new Most times when, when we see a new,

Unknown Speaker  2:19:41
whatever payroll item it's it's something like

Unknown Speaker  2:19:46
bonus for good behavior. It's not bad, but like some odd,

Unknown Speaker  2:19:52
oddly worded bonus or something like that,

Unknown Speaker  2:19:57
that makes sense. And then.

Unknown Speaker  2:20:00
Whitney puts on anyone, yeah, she just creates a item and throws it in. I mean, it happens maybe two or three times, but the the bonus from our side are always consistent. Well, we have about four or five options

Unknown Speaker  2:20:13
for the name.

Unknown Speaker  2:20:16
It's transport deduction

Unknown Speaker  2:20:19
commissions. There's just a handful, we mean, from our side, from payroll going to Whitney, yeah, yeah. It's just coming back from Whitney. It's yeah.

Unknown Speaker  2:20:31
So the the main question then is, on the chart of accounts,

Unknown Speaker  2:20:41
do we want to have?

Unknown Speaker  2:20:45
Like we could simplify it somewhat If, on the employee record, we would have a separate list

Unknown Speaker  2:20:53
of basically wage types, I guess. And it's like, this much percent management wages, this much percent sales wages, this much percent support? I

Unknown Speaker  2:21:08
don't know what the category should all be. Well, take like if you look at at Laverne scheduler, I know he's split out to three or four different categories.

Unknown Speaker  2:21:20
As an employee, like,

Unknown Speaker  2:21:30
Wait, said it.

Unknown Speaker  2:21:32
There we go.

Unknown Speaker  2:21:34
At the bottom, it's compensation setting, yeah right,

Unknown Speaker  2:21:38
or yeah on the right there. Like, what you're thinking, Okay, this all works just fine, I believe. But what we're

Unknown Speaker  2:21:46
you're asking, how do we map to the the

Unknown Speaker  2:21:50
liabilities, or how do we map to the payroll taxes and insurance, the correct payroll taxes and insurance accounts? I think,

Unknown Speaker  2:21:58
yep, What's your suggestion? Well, there's two ways we could do this. One, we could leave this unchanged, and on the accounting company map out, make a list of of a wage expense accounts and what it maps out to on the liability side. And then, and then, you can only select, that's, that's, you can only select those options on an employee record if it's been configured that way,

Unknown Speaker  2:22:24
that's that's the least amount of changing things up. The

Unknown Speaker  2:22:31
other way would be to have this, don't put the financial account on here. Have Bigger buckets that you select, and you map out the buckets then to the correct

Unknown Speaker  2:22:43
gross wage expense and and payroll insurance or tax and insurance expense account.

Unknown Speaker  2:22:51
Okay, so the first option would be, you continue to do this, this, this, the accounts would now be a filtered list only what's showing on the

Unknown Speaker  2:23:01
accounting company,

Unknown Speaker  2:23:04
yep. And then here we have another column

Unknown Speaker  2:23:10
to the right, which are the like the, or you'd say sales wages, and then if, and

Unknown Speaker  2:23:18
then you'd have the corresponding

Unknown Speaker  2:23:21
payroll taxes and insurance account to the right of that is that, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  2:23:28
that makes sense to me. I think that's the cleanest way to

Unknown Speaker  2:23:32
that way on the employee record, we're still, we're just setting

Unknown Speaker  2:23:36
where he's working, The the area where he Right, yeah, yeah, and

Unknown Speaker  2:24:02
there, and then we also need a,

Unknown Speaker  2:24:14
how about the checking account that it gets paid out of. We can,

Unknown Speaker  2:24:19
we can set the default cash or bank account up here, we can have a separate payroll,

Unknown Speaker  2:24:26
payroll bank account.

Unknown Speaker  2:24:31
Do we, I mean, it's it's currently, and I don't see that changing. It's all being paid out of the primary checking account. Do we have a way or a place where we set primary taking account on the company. That's right, I forgot about that. It's because

Unknown Speaker  2:24:53
we have this account set up as a current asset instead of a bank account. We had talked about a workaround in.

Unknown Speaker  2:25:00
Well, I don't

Unknown Speaker  2:25:03
think it matters anymore. The reason we had it occurred asset is because we want it listed as a current asset on the balance sheet, but we have the balance sheet groups now, I think we should just be able to select current bank account now.

Unknown Speaker  2:25:18
I mean,

Unknown Speaker  2:25:20
are we better off to

Unknown Speaker  2:25:22
just on the accounting company just have a payroll bank account setting?

Unknown Speaker  2:25:29
I'm fine with that. I don't really, genuinely don't care. But we keep so we keep adding settings to select the same account

Unknown Speaker  2:25:40
true, which makes it feel like maybe it should be stored in one place. But,

Unknown Speaker  2:25:47
I mean, do you have an opinion? Drew

Unknown Speaker  2:25:51
No. I mean, I think it would work either way. It's your call. Whatever you think is best.

Unknown Speaker  2:25:59
This is not that many places yet, but it's not just stripe. I mean, I mean, you can, you can make a reasonable argument if you guys were to use multiple bank accounts, you can make a reasonable argument to have multiple settings. It really, genuinely,

Unknown Speaker  2:26:16
yeah, it's a lot of settings. But I

Unknown Speaker  2:26:20
me.

Unknown Speaker  2:26:24
So up until now, we've always used the primary. I think that's what we're going to make. We'll continue to use if that were ever to change, I think we could add a field if that would be my

Unknown Speaker  2:26:37
suggestion, but

Unknown Speaker  2:26:40
that's your instinct would be the

Unknown Speaker  2:26:44
you just okay, but there's no, there's no reason is there? Is there a problem if I change this to a bank account subtype, I

Unknown Speaker  2:26:52
don't know that there is. I mean, what's going to change through? I don't think so. I mean, as long as the

Unknown Speaker  2:26:58
No, it's the balance sheet, the

Unknown Speaker  2:27:02
balance sheet role,

Unknown Speaker  2:27:05
or whatever, yeah, the balance balance sheet role is, is that?

Unknown Speaker  2:27:09
Yeah?

Unknown Speaker  2:27:13
And I think let's just run this to see how this generates. But I think, I

Unknown Speaker  2:27:17
think this should generate,

Unknown Speaker  2:27:20
and then now it's there

Unknown Speaker  2:27:25
things suffering.

Unknown Speaker  2:27:28
We have the current

Unknown Speaker  2:27:32
primary. It did leave. It went to the other current assets. I

Unknown Speaker  2:27:40
Hmm,

Unknown Speaker  2:27:47
well, oh, balance sheet roll is not filled in.

Unknown Speaker  2:27:56
Should be current assets.

Unknown Speaker  2:28:04
Let's try this again.

Unknown Speaker  2:28:11
Okay,

Unknown Speaker  2:28:16
if we do that, let's go over here. I'm

Unknown Speaker  2:28:35
okay, primary, Yeah, that one's, now, it's up there. Okay, that's, that's all it takes. We're good. I don't think there's a an account. You'll have a setting for the

Unknown Speaker  2:28:47
accrued what do we call it? Accrued payroll liabilities?

Unknown Speaker  2:28:52
Okay, you have that already. Yeah, yeah, those all get put to one

Unknown Speaker  2:29:00
single liability, yeah, okay. I was, I had wondered about that too, whether there's a state, whether you break apart state liability, but state versus federal. But okay,

Unknown Speaker  2:29:12
so then that, okay, so then ignoring the liabilities.

Unknown Speaker  2:29:18
Do you want all the liabilities lumped together? Or do you want them broken down by name?

Unknown Speaker  2:29:23
Broken down by Okay, the liabilities you're saying, the ones that go to the balance sheet account that yes,

Unknown Speaker  2:29:34
no, those can all be lumped together, couldn't they do? I mean, that's what we had been doing. We're just Yeah. Or do we want repo? I mean, I mean we want, we want to know if the payment is to the IRS or something like that, when it's actually payment. But as far as was this Medicare, whatever that,

Unknown Speaker  2:29:56
or which employee, or anything like that, it's just which employee.

Unknown Speaker  2:30:00
You know? I mean, I mean, one of the things we want with doing it in here is to be able to go and assist and see how much was the employee paid right now, all that we can see just rose pay, so that we could see the net pay. But that wouldn't really,

Unknown Speaker  2:30:15
I mean, yeah, there you have those, those payment records for that. So I

Unknown Speaker  2:30:22
don't think the liability side is necessary.

Unknown Speaker  2:30:32
Okay, what's that? Uh,

Unknown Speaker  2:30:44
I mean this, this accounting impact transaction, is incorrect.

Unknown Speaker  2:30:48
So I'll fix it up. We need those other fields. I think I'm pretty clear on what we need.

Unknown Speaker  2:30:54
Do you want to remove the notch, Stripe, payout, payment accounts, if we can use the Set the

Unknown Speaker  2:31:01
Bank Account field, or should we just leave Should we just leave them?

Unknown Speaker  2:31:07
If we have them, I don't care. Are you guys fine saying stripe and notch always go into primary checking

Unknown Speaker  2:31:15
so far? Yeah, I think the same

Unknown Speaker  2:31:20
argument is it's true there.

Unknown Speaker  2:31:25
The only thing that does not is Miscellaneous sales, orders, payments. Sometimes

Unknown Speaker  2:31:35
it's just regular deposits, but we're selecting the account anyway. Sure.

Unknown Speaker  2:31:42
Okay, so we have, we can just go fix these quick,

Unknown Speaker  2:31:47
because we're already as far as from the making payment side. We're already, we already have the bank account assigned to payment types, so doesn't affect that. I

Unknown Speaker  2:32:05
Oh, your payment tax already specified, which account, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  2:32:10
not that.

Unknown Speaker  2:32:13
Hey, cornesa,

Unknown Speaker  2:32:15
we got that. We got that, and then all we need is to change these guys over to

Unknown Speaker  2:32:22
primary checking. This guy, primary checking. Do we? Can we set up asset classes ourselves?

Unknown Speaker  2:32:32
We add ourselves into the asset class

Unknown Speaker  2:32:41
that should there was

Unknown Speaker  2:32:52
Matthias. Can we add our asset classes, hardwired or those you have full control. You can do whatever, whatever your heart desires.

Unknown Speaker  2:33:08
Good. So good, I

Unknown Speaker  2:33:13
think so

Unknown Speaker  2:33:15
well, on the other side of this complexity, if we get to the point where this just works.

Unknown Speaker  2:33:22
It will make Aaron and myself very happy, actually.

Unknown Speaker  2:33:28
Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  2:33:30
you guys are going to be in on sooner, yeah, Whitney's just going to put them in when she whenever she runs payroll, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  2:33:40
yeah, it

Unknown Speaker  2:33:42
should be easier for everybody, because he Whitney won't have I won't be asking Whitney, hey, I need some of those files sent over.

Unknown Speaker  2:33:52
Good. Well, should we do a quick prioritize

Unknown Speaker  2:33:56
or prioritize our I think we're done

Unknown Speaker  2:34:00
as long as, as long as that one that we were just looking at is up

Unknown Speaker  2:34:04
at the top mark, try to

Unknown Speaker  2:34:08
get another steak dinner out of this.

Unknown Speaker  2:34:13
That's an idea. How much is it worth there.

Unknown Speaker  2:34:19
So you Okay, so you've got,

Unknown Speaker  2:34:26
again, fast stuff. We don't need to look at that.

Unknown Speaker  2:34:30
I think the top two, we could also call this fast, like the ones that Nicks. Well, ignore those, whatever,

Unknown Speaker  2:34:41
those guys, right?

I was checking with Nick on the company scorecard optimization. He said that he thinks he's kind of close to getting it like 30% faster, but it's hard to get the numbers

Unknown Speaker  2:34:58
to quite line up is to get the same.

Unknown Speaker  2:35:00
And so they still show the same numbers, or what I think I didn't

Unknown Speaker  2:35:06
fully check. We can ignore those two. I mean, those are happening, so I don't think it's

Unknown Speaker  2:35:16
so the switching that incentive pay, fixed pay. How much is that? How much work is there on that?

Unknown Speaker  2:35:23
I think it's like

Unknown Speaker  2:35:26
one to two hours, probably two.

Unknown Speaker  2:35:30
I need to make sure that it

Unknown Speaker  2:35:32
that wherever we're actually running payroll Calc, that we're using the adjusted stuff correctly.

Unknown Speaker  2:35:40
So I

Unknown Speaker  2:35:42
think I'll probably code it just because I know where I think I know where payroll will or won't break. Yeah, that's kind of you probably know better than anybody else. Probably

Unknown Speaker  2:35:56
Um,

Unknown Speaker  2:36:00
well, so I think everything in progress and very high is happening already. We just kind of leave that. So what do we need to look at, as far as prioritizing? Is it

Unknown Speaker  2:36:12
we never did look at improved project management? And I think that's fine.

Unknown Speaker  2:36:21
Not sure. Remittance, email, nothing.

Unknown Speaker  2:36:25
That was the credit memos on the email. Yeah. So in some of that, it's not, that's not.

Unknown Speaker  2:36:32
I mean, if there's a lot of this stuff here, this one if, if you guys are tied up, but you have development budget, something like this is another good one to send off.

Unknown Speaker  2:36:46
What I'll probably do is I'll, I'll write, I'll write these up on our side, and then have them sitting around, and then I'll keep a bit of an eye on how much development we've done or not for the month, and where we have time. I'll send them through. And we're still using the same budget, not the budget that,

Unknown Speaker  2:37:04
yeah. I mean, what I was planning for, yeah, let's and I'd say,

Unknown Speaker  2:37:11
I mean, let's do that. If we go to high

Unknown Speaker  2:37:15
there's really nothing in there that's

Unknown Speaker  2:37:19
super urgent. So I'd say just, yeah, just work through those. It's just good work to pick off as there's time. Yeah, yeah. The improved project management one, I think we need to before we do that one. I don't feel like, I don't know about you guys, but my brain's about, we're out.

Unknown Speaker  2:37:39
But I think that one we should hold off on, and maybe in two weeks, plan a look at that one and move that one forward, I think. But all the others, I think we should just go

Unknown Speaker  2:37:52
with that and then,

Unknown Speaker  2:37:55
yeah, that's a Dwayne assigned to Dwayne so that that's not us, right?

Unknown Speaker  2:38:01
Seems reasonable.

Unknown Speaker  2:38:04
And I think the last,

Unknown Speaker  2:38:10
oh, that accounting, if we go into medium accounting, format improvements, move that to low, that's,

Unknown Speaker  2:38:20
I think there's still some.

Unknown Speaker  2:38:32
Yeah, if you guys are good with let's, let's just work through how they are,

Unknown Speaker  2:38:37
what we have all the way down to

Unknown Speaker  2:38:40
we'll just then in two weeks, we'll plan to look at the improved project management. One more specifically, yeah, sounds good. I'm guessing we won't do lots of development other than the payroll stuff yet this month, because it Nick's in next is he in with you all next week? Some

Unknown Speaker  2:38:57
next Wednesday? Yeah, the 28th I think he's going to be here. Okay? I think we're we're not at the limit yet, but we're getting there. Do you want mark if, if I've got resources, is there any of this? Is there

Unknown Speaker  2:39:13
any of this documentation? If there's resources, especially around accounting impact, we should pick off? Or do you want to keep holding off on that until

Unknown Speaker  2:39:22
down the road?

Unknown Speaker  2:39:24
No, I think if we have, if we have time and

Unknown Speaker  2:39:31
budget for it in in the month of January or February, I'd say we should. It's one of those things that we need to do at some point. Anyway, sure, I you,

Unknown Speaker  2:39:43
great,

Unknown Speaker  2:39:45
good, good,

Unknown Speaker  2:39:48
okay, thanks guys, Yep, thanks Mark. Thank you. Thanks.
