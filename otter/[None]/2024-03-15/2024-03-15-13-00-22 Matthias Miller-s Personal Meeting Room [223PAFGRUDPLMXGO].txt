Unknown Speaker  00:06
Well

Unknown Speaker  01:00
Hello

Matthias Miller  01:39
this is Mark Mark How are you this afternoon

Speaker 1  01:52
I'm running running out of time this week to get getting my stuff done but doing well are you

Matthias Miller  02:01
understanding doing well we got Kira back there the internet is out at her house calling on my phone i'll see if i can buy like coffee shops or anything.

Speaker 1  02:23
So is this sounds like Ben is? Is that who I'm talking to?

Matthias Miller  02:28
Now this is my sorry this is with ISU. Okay.

Speaker 1  02:30
Well, it sounds like Ben, but I I knew you were the ones that had had a snowstorm. So

Matthias Miller  02:39
yeah. We've had I think something like 18 I think some reports have been 18 inches. But it's I mean, it's melting pretty fast. It started with rain. And it's I'd be surprised if anything besides the snow piles would be left before I don't know, Tuesday but the.

Matthias Miller  03:38
What drew was going to

Speaker 2  03:41
Yeah, I'm on. Okay, great. On the SKU lots being recreated. did more than names changed at all?

Matthias Miller  03:58
The names, the names and the POS should have been changed and all of that should have gotten.

Speaker 2  04:06
Yeah. I mean, if we change an account name that a SKU lot is assigned to like if Aaron does, then it just creates a duplicate when he does an upload of that. Now, that's rial accounts. But like if he makes if we make changes online, that are not made in his SKU lot sheet. When he updates the SKU law, when he pushes his SKU lot sheet on, it just creates it recreates the one that that he has

Matthias Miller  04:49
that am I probably the Josh question. Question. Yeah. Well, I

Speaker 2  04:54
mean, that's, I'm just thinking, maybe that's what happened here and recreating the SKU law. So you think it's something else?

Matthias Miller  05:06
Well, I mean, I did some digging, basically what happens is that the it's a long story, but we tried to recreate 1000s of SKU lots. And when we did that, we

Matthias Miller  05:26
there were it couldn't recreate all of them. And so it couldn't complete step two of the process, which was to flag the POS as as having been having had few slots created for them. And so, at least in this case, I think, well, that was at least what I, I attributed it to. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  06:05
All right. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  06:07
I mean, I'm not familiar with how the scoops skillet thinking works.

Speaker 1  06:14
And on this, the I did check this, the inventory levels, two of them are exactly the same. And the ones the other ones, change by 100 and $180. So we're going to have a good day and thanks. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  06:37
Well, that's good.

Speaker 3  06:41
Like, about half a dozen or a dozen SKU, lots that were modified that account for that difference. So you're fine. Just leaving those as is?

Speaker 1  06:53
Yeah, I mean, it's okay. You're aware of what I mean? Were you still chasing those wide?

Speaker 3  06:57
Yeah. I mean, I could, there was one question that I had regarding what was regarding

Unknown Speaker  07:06
the unit of measure that was no longer?

Unknown Speaker  07:09
Yeah, no longer existed? And then

Speaker 1  07:15
you get Aaron's response on that. I think he sent you a response on what he did.

Unknown Speaker  07:19
I have not been in my email. So yeah,

Speaker 1  07:21
should be rolled. Okay. Well, I have it today. I mean, if you're working on it, let's go ahead and clean it up. Just so it's neat and tidy, but we don't run into issues in the future, but Okay.

Unknown Speaker  07:35
Sounds good. I'm guessing that that should balance everything out and then at that point, okay.

Speaker 3  07:55
And then I am just in front of my computer of joy. So your email come through, and I didn't I couldn't download the attachments or anything. So. Yeah. I'll have that.

Speaker 2  08:13
Okay, you're just saying just the 115 minute or 20 minutes ago or whatever?

Unknown Speaker  08:21
Yeah, I didn't. Okay. So I guess where are the you guys want to go? I think I found

Speaker 3  08:34
last night should have resolved an issue that we had with the receiving that voucher not matching what was actually happening. Basically, we were using, we were increasing r&b by the PIO amount and then decreasing it based on the vendor invoice amount. And so if the if the value change because of the vendor invoice, then it would r&b Wouldn't zero out. So I changed it, basically, reverse the PIO amount. And then you know, attribute the difference to whatever, whatever financial account it needs to be applied to. Okay, so that's part so I haven't dug deeper into the accounting diagnostic as far as the receive not vouchered. But that's, that's at least one more problem that we were running into there that. Okay.

Speaker 1  09:41
Matthias to help clarify what the change you've made would would do is so product receive products receive your $20 and when the invoice comes, there's a $3 surcharge. So then when the invoice is attached, the $20 is reversed And the $23.03 additional dollars is posted to that. You lied and to that account that material raw materials account or whatever. And then it's correct. $23 goes to AP but am I thinking about that correctly?

Unknown Speaker  10:32
Yes.

Matthias Miller  10:34
Okay, perfect good

Unknown Speaker  10:45
so

Speaker 3  10:54
so I don't know, do we want to we want to take a take a look again into into the receipt that voucher balance agnostic, I can also just take a look and start looking for differences and see.

Speaker 2  11:09
Um, well, I opened up a balance sheet and I got a few questions, we got more 35 million in the hole in undeposited funds. So Mark, I thought it was positive, this is negative, we have deposits and 35,000 million dollars more than we have.

Unknown Speaker  11:31
Okay, well, that's okay. That's,

Unknown Speaker  11:33
that's

Unknown Speaker  11:34
not that good bank.

Speaker 2  11:42
Is there? Is there any reason why I can just write a journal entry? Or maybe, I mean, I pulled up the ledger

Speaker 2  12:06
and want to be really nice if there'd be a big fat journal entry back here somewhere that I could just get rid of. The basically we're saying we put we took more money out of here and put it in the bank and what was even there. So how, how would that happen?

Speaker 3  12:25
One wondering, conceivably, it could happen if you received payments. Let me make sure that the scheduled task ran directly last night. That's the first thing is to make sure.

Speaker 2  12:37
Well, this is showing on my balance sheet. As of both like it's before, it's somewhere in 23.

Unknown Speaker  12:51
times now, we have the slow General Ledger again. If you see radically if if you say he has a positive printed deposit for a bunch of things prior to June of last year, that would make sense. But that much.

Speaker 2  13:27
I mean, I mean, there's a lot of there's 4000 line items in this in this thing. So you know if they average Well, if they average $10,000 That's still only gonna be 40 more, but half of them are like there's got to be something it's more than just an accumulation of of too many deposits.

Unknown Speaker  14:01
So we went back to yeah

Speaker 2  14:10
I mean, I guess there's a way transaction number repos.

Unknown Speaker  14:24
There's a, here's a huge deposit some STI back in 2001.

Unknown Speaker  14:39
Here's what happened.

Speaker 2  14:41
Okay, well, here's a huge deposit. What number is

Unknown Speaker  14:46
the positive number three are getting referenced. It wasn't even referenced already.

Speaker 2  14:52
Number three, transaction number 2043920.

Speaker 3  14:57
Yes, you Yeah so what we what we did is we created this thing to zero out historical payments to get them out of the report but I mean what we should have done is we should have changed probably changed undeposited funds report or the reports whatever the deposit report probably shouldn't exclude anything prior to when we started doing accounting impact, but I guess this is probably fine. I mean, if we know what it is, I will probably date it for this date and rate to be 123 or something just to make it and add some notes to your transactions. I don't know I think at this point, it's probably fine to Yeah,

Speaker 2  15:53
but but if we'd never received these like this was supposed to be a deposit of payments we received but it seems like if this is just yanking everything out of undeposited funds like it should have been 36 million Hi before we created this it seems like it was created like as if these never went in

Speaker 3  16:24
payments never payments before June this is going all the way back and all kinds of history payments before June of last year we've never made it into any positive funds

Speaker 2  16:34
God God Okay, so that's why it's bringing the huge negative so so I should just well so we'll just leave this the way it is and I will just write a journal entry

Unknown Speaker  16:54
for undeposited funds for no no no

Speaker 2  17:08
well let's figure out what our current undeposited funds get there and then just make the ending balance be right and then push this back.

Unknown Speaker  17:15
You could do that that'd be one way to do it. Let me know what your end of year and undeposited funds worth.

Speaker 2  17:29
Once you're gonna have to figure that out but that should be pretty easy because you know, we just look at current items and that's yeah yeah, okay. Okay, that makes sense. Um the Well, I didn't look at it but raw materials is 213,000 in the hole as well. So now that could be connected to buildings being pulled off

Speaker 1  18:20
I would expect I would expect that we usage exceeded reach read material used exceeded material received in that since June of last year by 213,000. Meaning because their inventory went down so we never started we never made a journal entry for the running balance so just that Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  18:51
yeah. Yeah, that makes sense.

Speaker 2  19:01
All right. Um, yeah, that's pretty much it for that and I did not get very far in looking at accounts payable, diagnostic balance balance diagnostic report, so I was hoping to dig into that here yet. But there doesn't look like there's just a lot I mean, there's on 234567 There's over seven that need figured out so that's pretty good.

Speaker 3  19:49
Yeah. Alright, so then, main, main keys for me. Oh, go ahead. No, I'm pulling up the r&g receive at vouchered diagnostics I want to see what it looks like I haven't had a chance to take a look at it since it's now

Unknown Speaker  20:17
Thursday yesterday

Speaker 2  20:39
I have a thing that I'm trying to figure out too is could you get me a report on the items dated prior to 1231 that now how would this be I want to know what I need to know is my I'd like to have a list of my transactions that are are not that are from 23 but not cleared until 24.

Speaker 2  21:31
But the thing is, is we got a bunch of that old stuff

Speaker 2  21:43
that we that we cleared in or reconcile in with like the January statement, I mean, I guess if it's that it was that old stuff we could just we could know that it's that old stuff I mean, it's all like

Unknown Speaker  22:00
November and earlier

Unknown Speaker  22:07
a key can you put something like that together

Unknown Speaker  22:29
actually we could go at it from the other side. And look at what was cleared in January that has a 23 date been nothing but

Unknown Speaker  22:46
continuous run reconciliation reports were and then just look at those old transactions are now

Unknown Speaker  22:52
yeah, that's basically what it would be.

Unknown Speaker  22:57
Is that good enough? Or do you need something more than that?

Speaker 2  23:06
So the reconciliate reconciliation report I didn't I have a whole bunch of stuff cleared for January for February but I haven't actually hit the reconcile button because I'm waiting on like one transaction or two or whatever it comes through. So if you could look at if it could just pull up Yeah, transaction from before 23 Or from before a set date that are cleared after the date

Unknown Speaker  23:49
so these are going to

Unknown Speaker  23:56
well reconciled or cleared we should sit down

Unknown Speaker  24:03
yeah we'll take a look we got

Speaker 3  24:32
we don't we don't allow reconciliation reconciliation reports. We're open reconciled. Oh

Speaker 2  24:44
well, that's fine. We can look at January as soon as I as soon as I do that, then I can include February in this I mean it's there's only They, I don't know. Two three items I'm pretty sure and I could probably just double check for

Speaker 3  25:10
the exports we can run a report if we need to. But with this in this particular case, if we could just use these here let me guess you're gonna want to share part of the issue is you want to check multiple accounts as well.

Unknown Speaker  25:29
Right

Speaker 3  25:34
So would it be based on the period start date or the period end date? Needs to be past the certain dates? Um,

Speaker 2  25:40
so yeah, it was it would be that one it would be after 1231 I want to look at what was what was cleared in January from So yeah, that's the one you'd want and then we want to look for items in there from 23

Speaker 3  26:04
are all all of these are all in all the statement basics you're looking at? Do they start on January 1?

Speaker 2  26:15
Um, they should eventually I mean, they're not there yet but

Speaker 3  26:30
I mean, I guess my point is right, your report let me just see if the if the statement end date show you anything that reconciled in your statement anything that either hasn't cleared at all? Or is it clear has been reconciled for a period that ends on or after January 1

Unknown Speaker  26:57
That would work

Speaker 2  27:05
if I can set that on or after date when I would use it for whatever account I'm using it for I could set it to whatever statement date I want so that would work

Unknown Speaker  27:21
as well or we could just we could potentially just give you a list of statements

Unknown Speaker  27:58
when you need to spy

Unknown Speaker  28:02
I'm now when I was in Kenya I mean I wonder if like so all the old old old stuff doesn't isn't going to like oh that's not that's not even relevant it's gonna be like

Unknown Speaker  28:32
why is this

Unknown Speaker  28:33
more stuff from December

Speaker 3  28:37
you all this in such a weird order I'll be clear

Speaker 2  28:46
Okay, yeah so keep going down the upper part was not cleared so we're too far

Unknown Speaker  29:06
maybe something needs here

Unknown Speaker  29:11
Oh no, I think those are one

Unknown Speaker  29:23
weird beat so be

Speaker 2  29:28
the should be like stuff from December or November in that section and the only thing there is a journal entry to make the thing mounds weird all the rest of that

Unknown Speaker  30:00
That's

Unknown Speaker  30:03
something got here something's

Speaker 2  30:05
off because there's I mean I know I mean I can go to this table I can find a couple of I mean I guess I can just do the I can just do the legwork on this one and you know pull those just just manually do it on there but that is weird that that doesn't give us

Unknown Speaker  30:34
Let me see what I can do

Unknown Speaker  30:45
record kilter

Unknown Speaker  30:55
and okay, let me see what I can do

Unknown Speaker  31:31
all right, um when just since we're in the reconcile thing

Speaker 2  31:45
when I open up, reconcile, okay, so you're going that way. Um

Speaker 2  32:04
so if you do the drop down menu, there are only like, two for the prompt questions. Yeah, it does not it like. So I click the link and then I have to put my numbers in here. And if I go out of it, and come back in, I have to re enter all those numbers like they don't those numbers don't get saved into this file here. And see what else is oh, I'm not always getting the add button for the new period. If, like, if that period was reconciled there if it was not an open period, then I can't get up. I can't start a new period. So would you just click on the link for the last one and then go in and set up a new period in the drop down menu thing?

Unknown Speaker  33:07
No, I

Speaker 2  33:09
mean we'll get rid of the extra numbers and make that be the open period and then add another period and then you know put the numbers in I'm

Unknown Speaker  33:30
briefly 16 No I don't want to say

Unknown Speaker  33:46
I don't understand why you can't fill in these numbers we're open curious

Speaker 2  33:57
Well, theoretically, if it's an open period, you don't know the end date the ending balance you know, like technically right now March should be the open period and you won't know you wouldn't know that email says But why there's not why there's not a button like the Adeline button should be there kind of regard I mean should be there when there's ending dates and all the lines then you shouldn't have the add a line but instead of the other way around

Unknown Speaker  34:40
Well, I mean when you at this point not sure what it's like there you can you can add a new line now.

Unknown Speaker  34:53
Um but Just go ahead and I don't think it's gonna do anything. Yeah, but now um, get get rid of your line

Unknown Speaker  35:14
and now you know you can head me hit it again, can

Unknown Speaker  35:25
that be the open period right?

Speaker 3  35:28
No. No, here's the issue. Am I close the period? Anyway? Oh, come on. No, it's just not it's not refreshing, right? So they close the period to slash 29 and add a new row

Unknown Speaker  35:48
and they say, ah, nevermind, I don't want this one doesn't bring the button back even though even though it's like I can't make change but if I open and close it and fill everything back in, then it looks me at a new row.

Speaker 2  36:17
Right but right because that's what I've had to do is that's what I've had to do

Speaker 2  36:27
prior information and then add a row so what I've started doing is before I go into finish reconciling something, then I will I'll make a new row first. And then we'll go ahead and finish my reconcile. So I have the row there for the next that's so I mean, I think

Unknown Speaker  36:56
okay, so if you let me try this that's weird. Let me let me just see if I can

Unknown Speaker  37:11
let me see if I can just see what's going on

Unknown Speaker  37:25
Add Row Oh, that's just okay, come on guys. Y'all know better.

Speaker 2  37:47
Might be nice. If we'd still get that ask prompt drop down thing. And then you'd put your information in there. And then like, if it's a new if it's a new date, you know, then it would save like it wouldn't it wouldn't save to that other grid piece until you've reconciled something and then it says okay, here's the new reconcile that has happened here's here's a new event and let's let's post it here

Speaker 3  38:21
so you're saying if you go into February

Unknown Speaker  38:26
3 would just be no open period in that list and you'd get the other prompt first

Speaker 3  38:38
right um but yeah, I mean for technical reasons it's

Unknown Speaker  38:50
it's probably hard to do

Unknown Speaker  39:06
Yeah, I can see y z

Speaker 2  39:10
Well, I mean if you're if for the for the time being if you could just make so that we can even if the last one just is closed

Unknown Speaker  39:25
that's terrible. I will yeah, I'll see. I'll see if somebody can chase it somebody broke in Bangladesh this weekend either. Either product Yeah. All right.

Speaker 3  39:52
So it does look to me like I think I still have some mistakes in this report I think that's why this is showing up. But you'll see here going over my career referencing your team member but if you go back to earlier these transactions were not we're not adding up. I personally received my Bachelor's this would have been like 893 And now this one had 1213 72 credit 99

Speaker 3  40:30
I think my issue is just that this report isn't I don't know exactly I'm not splitting it apart correctly. Oh, match. I see. So that does require a little bit more work and I think that'll that should that looks to be the main issue and then apart from that as long as I don't know I guess there's a question why is this vendor invoice not rolling out to the seven themselves this purchase order

Speaker 3  41:15
Well, it might be that's the same issue. Okay. I will look into that

Speaker 3  41:25
and then make a letter to myself on that on the

Unknown Speaker  41:37
right to its ugly voice

Speaker 3  41:50
okay all right. So my list of priorities still are going up as last few years let me also make sure I got my

Speaker 3  42:11
got it. Erin's email just went in a different folder. That's why I got Aaron's email putting up this SKUs to clean up the rest of the ins stuff. Next number two is still r&b Step number three is is getting any positive account balance agnostics friend deposited funds. And then number four is acid IDs. Drew were in that list. Would you like to see the the accounting the reconcile report

Speaker 2  42:50
um, before the asset IDs Yeah, I think so.

Unknown Speaker  43:06
Anything else that we should be talking about?

Unknown Speaker  43:12
I think we ought to re

Unknown Speaker  43:15
up remark.

Speaker 1  43:18
No, nothing here. So we're still on for 530 year time meeting Monday morning then.

Unknown Speaker  43:28
Yes, yes. Okay. Yeah. So sounds good.

Unknown Speaker  43:41
Thank you.

Unknown Speaker  43:42
Yes, yes.
