Matthias Miller  00:41
I am so sorry guys I got carried away all right

Unknown Speaker  00:48
don't get carried away with

Speaker 1  00:55
I saw your discord messages going back and forth so I will forgive you.

Unknown Speaker  00:59
Okay, sounds good

Matthias Miller  01:02
that's what that's what distracted me. So

Unknown Speaker  01:09
now you have me what what you get carried away on. But

Matthias Miller  01:15
I was chasing down Fred H 276 at gmail and which salesperson and confirming that there was a lead reassigned, so

Unknown Speaker  01:34
yep. All righty. Well,

Matthias Miller  01:42
Mark did get your email looks like Seth is actually taking response about the update

Unknown Speaker  01:55
let's see.

Matthias Miller  02:00
Sorry, there's one reminder. I gotta make sure I get done before

Speaker 2  02:14
while you do that, while you do that, I'm curious Dwayne. payroll module. It sounds like you're pulling a bunch of resources into work on that. What? What? Pick up date on that.

Unknown Speaker  02:35
So I expect by the end of day, we'll have all the configuration stuff in

Speaker 1  02:43
Alice Allison sitting there dutifully working on it with my door hanging open, so she hears me so you heard the expectation Allison. And then I know that all the time cards went to AP. So I would say by either no day to day or sometime tomorrow, we should have we should be ready to run payroll, or to run payroll. We got too many verification reports. I can't keep this stuff straight in my head anymore. Vendor vendor verification for payroll verification boards. I'm gonna need a verification report to further verify the verification reports after bit I don't know. Anyway, we should be able to start running some of the some of those to see how everything's working.

Matthias Miller  03:28
Okay, I got a question because last I heard Seth was going to import old configurations from the old test system into the current test system, which means he's getting ready to blow away and import time cards which means he's getting ready to blow away whatever Addison is doing right now. He should not be doing that is that right? I don't know

Unknown Speaker  03:49
Allison hold up when when says planets to import?

Matthias Miller  03:58
Well, he was

Speaker 1  04:00
there was already employees there. So if he's just importing timecards he's gonna

Matthias Miller  04:06
He's we are preserving employee compensation information as well. So

Unknown Speaker  04:11
well, let me know when it's done. And I'll have her go back and start over.

Matthias Miller  04:18
I mean, we can I can also tell him not to stop overtime cards. Or

Speaker 1  04:24
we're not we're not currently entering timecard she's entering. She's updating employee compensation, configuration and company configurations and it's all configuration stuff at this point.

Matthias Miller  04:36
But which configurations like I needed. Company and employee configurations, correct.

Unknown Speaker  04:49
I never thought about that. After this. We will want to export and then import those when we do an update but Not right now. When we lose a whole bunch of work

Unknown Speaker  05:10
we'll call it practice work

Matthias Miller  05:15
that third time's a charm 20 We can we can tell here who's who's actually doing the work

Unknown Speaker  05:26
I would be upset if I hadn't done that work

Speaker 2  05:37
so Dwayne, it sounds like by sometime tomorrow, you'll have data entered able to send back out updates on sent back out, you know what this is showing? So that we can hopefully I mean, that's why those plans and then what Aaron and I want to work on tomorrow morning is put together basic flowchart for process once it's running like this, Hey, mister district, or hey builder, you need to send your timecard two ways by this time in order to get here's where you send your time cards to. And then these people will enter the information and sent back to verification reports by this time. If you have question two, something's wrong, whatever. Contact and then both billers to your office in your office to build or so we'll try to put a basic draft together and then yeah, because we have that because we'll meet.

Speaker 1  06:51
As I was explaining this to the team this morning, I suddenly realized that I don't know what is considered verified payroll and how does Whitney know when to come pay it? How does she what's the are we going to do we have some kind of status thing Do we have some way of saying this payroll is verified this is not verified?

Speaker 2  07:09
Yeah, that's what that that process because I think last time Mabel had been reaching out to Nelson or someone that you know, with questions on time cards just because we're any different and nobody, how is she supposed to know? So that's yeah, we'll we'll should have that tomorrow sometime. Then we'll send it rough draft you reviewed because we'll need your input as well. You know what? I think it's going to be pretty straightforward once it's set up.

Speaker 1  07:50
But Matthias what what was spec on I know we have verification report and we can say who the who the representative that gets these these verification reports. But what's the spec as far as quote verifying the payroll what like how does how does Whitney know it's verified and ready to pay?

Matthias Miller  08:12
That is a good question.

Unknown Speaker  08:13
I'm glad you brought that up

Matthias Miller  08:20
sorry, high school days coming back to haunt me finalizing payroll after assist has received verification for both owners and production it would

Unknown Speaker  08:35
use

Matthias Miller  08:37
time entries to calculate building labor costs a freeze the numbers in the profitability report to the company this will be completed in a separate module and send the payroll information to the accountant

Matthias Miller  08:59
well let's go look at let's go look at what we go to

Matthias Miller  09:11
scan UPS it's not you product change search you know like for subscriptions Yfp we're gonna look for payroll at the title find his job back from Ian's go. By stat Why is it not?

Unknown Speaker  09:30
It was only three years ago Wait,

Matthias Miller  09:37
oh, sorry. External projects team.

Unknown Speaker  09:41
out about a boom

Matthias Miller  09:44
sis payroll to the root job. Go to the channel stops jobs by status. Okay, now. Show me the hierarchy by hire

Unknown Speaker  10:00
I've heard crazy people only talk out loud to themselves

Matthias Miller  10:05
yeah intelligent conversation sometime

Speaker 1  10:10
I've got I've got a cover on here somewhere that says of course I talked to myself No Wait wait wait what does it say? I said something about I need to find an intelligent conversation somewhere or something like that is

Speaker 3  10:25
payroll payroll tuition scheduling task reports freeze finalize freeze scheduled tasks calculations and see what these guys do things payroll

Unknown Speaker  10:54
Well, here's the job alright, let's

Matthias Miller  10:55
see what he did here.

Unknown Speaker  10:56
Boo Boo

Matthias Miller  11:04
I could ask Seth I'm pretty sure he's going to scratch his head spin be like

Unknown Speaker  11:23
whoa

Unknown Speaker  11:31
are we doing what do you need to be looped

Speaker 1  11:32
in? Because they let her know what she did start working again. She can

Matthias Miller  11:37
she can start working we're not going to stumble over it well that's why I was asking says we'll do everything else

Speaker 1  11:49
right so I can tell her she can go back to entering information.

Speaker 3  11:52
Yep. Including time cards. Okay, very good. If you wanna

Matthias Miller  11:59
come companies employees and

Unknown Speaker  12:03
well hang on do you

Matthias Miller  12:09
let's see. Do you want me to skip timecards as well well

Unknown Speaker  12:16
then you're importing nothing right

Matthias Miller  12:21
companies accounts transactions where

Unknown Speaker  12:23
is Josh

Matthias Miller  12:28
what are we doing companies are high standards we will return shortly

Unknown Speaker  12:42
if you recognize this guy's voice

Unknown Speaker  12:46
thank you for holding we will return shortly

Matthias Miller  12:56
your

Speaker 1  12:57
what's even what's even funnier by smart back thank you for holding so with that that child if you know anything about that child that is that comes from movie called it Close Encounters of the Third degree it's like this old Alien movie where they were trying to communicate with the aliens we will return

Speaker 1  13:25
and the funny thing is when I made that when I'm when I made that sound I've totally did not think about what I was making

Unknown Speaker  13:41
it was hilarious well

Speaker 1  13:51
alright so back to the can I yes or no on moving forward

Matthias Miller  14:05
yes you can but it means we will be buildings financials and FDI financial allocations

Unknown Speaker  14:09
so pretty much

Unknown Speaker  14:15
nothing as far as payroll then so that's okay, got it. I'll try to go

Unknown Speaker  14:31
get it

Unknown Speaker  14:41
so you just permanently muted mark and we'll never know when he comes back.

Matthias Miller  14:44
Yeah, that's kind of unfortunate. Should I just kick them off?

Unknown Speaker  14:49
Maybe be easier for him to he's finally over there yelling at the phone.

Unknown Speaker  15:01
I'm

Matthias Miller  15:04
gonna ask them you don't know what happens when you dial in and get asked to unmute. Anyway.

Unknown Speaker  15:07
Maybe we'll keep telling him to unmute.

Matthias Miller  15:10
Let's also skip time. Oh, there we go. We got you back. Sorry

Unknown Speaker  15:13
about that. You were listening to Dwayne's voice

Matthias Miller  15:26
Okay, so All right. I think we got the imports nailed down. What else are you talking about?

Speaker 2  15:41
So, Messiah as you were saying, we're importing out of accounts, I think financial allocations. I think I think you said something about buildings. We are or we're not stomping over the buildings that Josh brought in on the copy over from the live yard.

Matthias Miller  16:03
Because there were some missing so I would like to stump over all the buildings.

Speaker 2  16:12
Okay, does that mean that we're going back to save only buildings from November of May two? Or does that only bring in I think before this we had ancient ancient building data, or buildings. In the test system. I don't think we had anything since.

Matthias Miller  16:47
Yeah, that will get us I mean, we have 99% of buildings or whatever the number is, but it'll get us 100% of the buildings at that point.

Unknown Speaker  16:58
Oh, wait,

Speaker 2  16:59
when you stamp these back in it will it won't? It won't not all the new ones that Josh brought in.

Matthias Miller  17:07
I'm sorry, it will

Unknown Speaker  17:11
wait a minute.

Matthias Miller  17:13
All the billing import does is building import doesn't actually pull in buildings, it just brings in FDI costs

Matthias Miller  17:30
so we don't there is no FDI costs coming from the live system. So we don't need to worry about that you guys can start from scratch.

Unknown Speaker  17:40
Saying FDI the actual cost if there would be standard standard costing would be coming from the live system.

Matthias Miller  17:50
Okay, do you want those Can we just

Matthias Miller  18:02
can we just do it one time like

Unknown Speaker  18:09
I'm lost now. Sorry.

Speaker 2  18:12
Well, it's okay. It seems to me like that the buildings that we had on the test system this morning when we

Unknown Speaker  18:20
are meeting in our meeting with drew that that sufficient or that's what we need as the FDI because the block of buildings we were testing

Unknown Speaker  18:35
obviously those were all there because our numbers matched up exactly to what it tested. But it seems to me like we would not need to

Speaker 2  18:47
there would be no need to import any building information back into a sample rainy billing information again. Right.

Matthias Miller  19:00
Yes, that okay. One question I have are the FTI calculations is going to be the same in the live system as they are in the test system. The standard costing percentages and rules

Unknown Speaker  19:18
ah

Speaker 2  19:24
no, well, okay. They are not at some point when we're ready to start using that.

Unknown Speaker  19:38
Here's what I see happening is the next month or so we're going to dial in on what should our NHS be a live system and we'll go in and update those numbers in the live system

Speaker 2  19:58
and At that point, I don't think it'll matter if we do a copy over from the live system if we stomp on if we change that information in the test system it would wreak havoc on our

Unknown Speaker  20:24
actual cause

Speaker 2  20:39
or if we break it down to one building right now we're for materials we're calculating 38% That's, that's, that's close enough for testing but at some point, we're going to say well looked at history and we've done an analysis and we know that that should be 39.8 and we'll go in and update the live system so that we're getting

Unknown Speaker  21:07
realistic finished goods inventory cause the live system using in QuickBooks rest of this year and when we do a copy over after we've made that change then it could obviously change you're not sure what would happen at that point.

Matthias Miller  21:52
I guess my question is should we have a process

Matthias Miller  22:00
to recalculate?

Matthias Miller  22:08
Sorry, this stuff is starting to make my

Unknown Speaker  22:11
eyes glaze over my head spin.

Speaker 2  22:16
Like we're feels like we're going to get the testing on the FDA cost allocations nailed down in the next two weeks. Then after that, if we stomp all over those when we change something in the live system we cover copy it over it doesn't matter but maybe maybe it does

Matthias Miller  22:43
I mean, let me go pull let me pull up this change request that I had for Seth and let's walk through this step by step and let's make sure that

Speaker 3  23:02
let's try CCUSA that's going to be something testing encoding changes system okay, because next words may see if I could do a

Unknown Speaker  23:23
yeah that's the wrong one mark Wayne ban

Unknown Speaker  23:53
Okay give

Matthias Miller  23:54
me 30 seconds to come through

Matthias Miller  24:18
Mark let me know when when that gets through and comes through and we'll take a look at that

Unknown Speaker  24:36
Dwayne, I see your copied on a bunch of time cards. Information from for Shannon to enter. payroll module

Unknown Speaker  24:53
sounds like fun Yeah,

Speaker 2  25:07
But as you can see it still hasn't come through on my site you can tell says that we've been what we've worked on payroll module so far we've been impressed with his really impressed with his thoroughness and is

Speaker 2  25:28
usually has pretty pretty valid reasons for for doing what he does and doing it how he does it. So it's good

Unknown Speaker  25:43
okay, that has come through

Matthias Miller  25:55
okay, we'll pass it along, I'm sure that's going to mean something to me. Okay. So

Matthias Miller  26:04
here are what we think we want to preserve buildings, match on steppin and maintain all the work order information, the production time by station, and the FDI category and related costs. So that means it's all columns then. Sorry.

Speaker 2  26:54
So on the buildings, here, we're talking about what we're stamping back in, like the data that we pulled out of the test system that we're now stamping back in? Yes. So when set does import, the building's going to go through and see

Unknown Speaker  27:18
has a building with a skin that matches and that was copied over from the live system, it would be good

Speaker 2  27:30
to override whatever was in the live system, these fields like the work order effective date, the production time station, FDA category

Speaker 2  27:44
then the building labor intensive Aman, is that, is that correct?

Unknown Speaker  27:52
Or one more time, please.

Speaker 2  27:59
So let's say a building set building as 1000 was copied over from a live system. And says is now running the import stomping over that building. And he already has billing as 1000 are from the test system? He's bringing that in? And so it matches up? The student number it finds s 1000. And it says no, no, the work order effective date. Great going to use what we had in the test system and override the one that came over from the live system. The same with the production time station in the building FGI category.

Unknown Speaker  28:50
That Correct?

Matthias Miller  28:51
Yes, it is. And one point of clarification is that what I put there is shorthand for everything in the work order embedded spreadsheet, all the rows and columns for quarters, all the rows and columns for production time. And all the rows and columns for FDI category

Speaker 2  29:10
which would mean all the FTA categories stuff. Everything we were looking at this foreknown like the actual cost, the freeze is actual cost freeze. And of course his actual and all of those fields. Yeah. Okay, so what will it do with? Okay, that makes sense? That's good. What will it do with that now we copied from the live system, spin number as 5000 and that was not in the test system at all. So is the test system going to wipe it out? Or is it going to just let it go because it has no as 5000 it's dumping back in

Unknown Speaker  30:10
don't know this information because

Speaker 2  30:17
in order to test it's important that it that it, it leaves those new buildings that were copied over that it leaves those in the test system,

Unknown Speaker  30:33
the Okay, so maybe I can do a flowchart

Matthias Miller  30:46
and send that over and maybe that would help.

Unknown Speaker  30:51
What's the message? This?

Speaker 2  31:00
Or maybe well, let me ask maybe I can clarify with, let me ask this question. So the buildings we were looking at this forenoon with Drew, those were buildings that were built in May of this year, watch what will happen with those buildings. And okay, and those buildings were not in the test system. Prior to the copy over from the live, what will happen with those buildings, when that pushes it information back in?

Matthias Miller  31:32
Seth is not going to push his information back in until July 8, or whenever that happens. And so what's going to happen at that point is new buildings from the live system that weren't in the test system are going to come in with whatever calculations that they had in the live system.

Unknown Speaker  31:51
Okay, perfect. And that's Yeah, that.

Unknown Speaker  31:58
Yeah, that's perfect. Yeah. Um,

Matthias Miller  32:06
and then the labor intensive amount gets preserved as well.

Matthias Miller  32:17
And then we do the company records, ie builder records, match those, copy those from the live system, no, sorry, copy those from the old test system. All content, all active employees, all time cards, and all FTI financial allocations. And not listed here is all the accounting company's accounting chart of accounts in the accounting transactions as well.

Speaker 2  32:46
Okay, and then at the bottom, you have instructions for drew on how to run the export. So you're going to have him do that?

Unknown Speaker  32:53
Well,

Matthias Miller  32:54
let's clarify that I think this is old. I think, based on the last conversation we had with Josh, this morning, Josh was going to automate all this stuff, including the exports and imports, is that correct? Or is that not correct, is that

Unknown Speaker  33:09
I had understood that he was going to set it up to where Ben or Seth would have to do the export. Data to be preserved out of the test system. And then the copy over would be automated to where I think he was going to set it up to where

Unknown Speaker  33:33
send a text message to the copy or, and as soon as that's done, you would have to do the import

Speaker 2  33:44
some data to be preserved back into the test system is what what I interested

Matthias Miller  33:53
and is drew the right person for that, or is there somebody else who should be doing that? Should it be been?

Unknown Speaker  34:04
At No, I mean, I think that's true. As long as you give them instructions on how to do the Import Export,

Speaker 2  34:15
or is there a reason Dwayne, is that something that you might want to do as well? I'm guessing probably not. It's probably most of its going to be around accounting. I would think

Unknown Speaker  34:34
I'm struggling to have an opinion.

Speaker 2  34:41
Well, we can start out with with it being Drew and then he wants to do it as needs fallen. In great to train Dwayne how to do it. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  34:58
Well, my proposal is that once we get these done

Unknown Speaker  35:03
that we

Matthias Miller  35:09
do a little video plus perhaps a little video plus a whole bunch of links that you can click to get it done something like

Speaker 2  35:22
now you might mention that Seth is not going to stomp in data until the eighth make sure I understand earlier this morning I had thought that there's there's parts of that import that we should be holding off on right as more testing

Matthias Miller  35:46
he is doing he will be doing he's not doing the full import he's going to he's going to be doing the accounting companies accounting sort of accounts accounting transactions and the FDI financial allegations preserving those pulling those from the tests backup and everything else he's going to test that not do anything with until but but not do anything being with and then we'll handle that on for the July update

Unknown Speaker  36:18
okay

Unknown Speaker  36:22
good that believe that makes sense and

Unknown Speaker  36:30
do you know when he's going to do that? Or the initial one

Matthias Miller  36:44
he's working on it. I mean, he's pulled off in other projects both him and Nick are

Unknown Speaker  36:49
swamped with

Matthias Miller  36:52
all kinds of stuff but bottom line is he's still working on it it's okay I understand from you guys it's good good.

Speaker 2  37:01
Well, it's me too as other he's working on other plants stuff it's just if Yeah, just send us an email as soon as you're done and then he would go back to working on that but

Speaker 3  37:12
okay good okay um well

Matthias Miller  37:32
got it here let me I also miss this

Unknown Speaker  37:45
okay, let me count payable

Unknown Speaker  38:02
Wait Okay, so

Matthias Miller  38:06
the updating test system are we ready to start working through the agenda?

Speaker 2  38:13
Yeah, and I wasn't quite sure what what made most sense to cover today

Unknown Speaker  38:21
Bie Do we go into accounts payable or something else we should cover that you had on my head in mind?

Matthias Miller  38:31
Let me go into

Matthias Miller  38:50
swine

Unknown Speaker  39:25
okay, I had it

Matthias Miller  39:26
in my head that I got this more cleaned up than they actually did

Matthias Miller  39:35
don't know if you call it delusion or not but

Unknown Speaker  39:40
the

Speaker 3  39:48
let me send me an email. I thought that no, it did do the accounting packed

Unknown Speaker  40:36
okay

Matthias Miller  40:38
so here's the there's two parts to the AP stuff Part one is the payment scheduling and part two is the accounting impact

Matthias Miller  41:05
the accounting impact is the part of the report that I'm

Unknown Speaker  41:09
most come comfortable with

Matthias Miller  41:38
so let's break this thing apart into two pieces

Unknown Speaker  41:46
we have

Matthias Miller  41:52
okay so

Matthias Miller  42:09
let me let me share my screen mark it leaves you a little in the dark but it will give the rest of the guys a clue what's going on

Matthias Miller  42:30
so on the accounting impact

Matthias Miller  42:43
we're going to we're gonna have a configuration section for

Matthias Miller  42:54
embedded spreadsheet

Unknown Speaker  43:05
Do you want to

Matthias Miller  43:09
you want to track vendor invoice Do you want to track the source account based on payment type is this the same payment

Unknown Speaker  43:26
just like this

Matthias Miller  43:37
check cash ACH credit card are there any other payment types that need to be added are those for

Unknown Speaker  43:46
the payment types

Unknown Speaker  43:52
are we going to support wire

Unknown Speaker  43:58
we could sure

Matthias Miller  44:01
the wire in there and we could just put other

Unknown Speaker  44:10
Bitcoin barter

Unknown Speaker  44:15
I was thinking, thinking Bitcoin or Dwayne's cryptocurrency

Speaker 1  44:23
have a cryptocurrency, Dwayne's cryptocurrency? I hear it's up by 30 35% today.

Speaker 2  44:30
Okay, let me clarify Dwayne. cryptocurrency that you own Well, I don't know if you own it, I mean it on a screen you write your name but my argument ghost coin me and my checking account. What can I Where is that money and it's probably in the same place.

Speaker 1  44:55
Right now. I don't look at it because it it tanked its price a while back and I just don't look at it I just ignore it I made myself a commitment that said if I if I invest in this am I willing to lose the money and I said yes So right now I've lost the money but I just ignore it as David likes to say, you don't you never lose money until you actually commit to the sale you never make money or lose money until you commit to the sale

Matthias Miller  45:28
you didn't decide to switch over by like Nvidia stock or something instead

Speaker 1  45:38
my cryptocurrency was probably my one and only foray into high high risk investing

Matthias Miller  45:52
there's a lot I think there's a lot more shore investments with perhaps less stressed and but well it's certainly less emotional highs and lows for sure. Alright, so on the vendor invoice invoice we do have payment types Oh, look at that. So we be invoice payment types which is oh you can you can make it whatever be whatever it is you want fine

Matthias Miller  46:37
and then the app tied to an asset account and then on the vendor invoice Do you need a way to override the source account on the probably presumably on the vendor invoice

Speaker 2  47:03
not sure I'm following completely you set payment type tied to an asset account which would be any of the well as checking

Unknown Speaker  47:15
it's actually not just

Matthias Miller  47:16
asset it's we're going to call it payment account and it would be a list it would be a list of assets slash liability accounts

Unknown Speaker  47:34
and then on the

Matthias Miller  47:39
vendor invoice using payment payment type credit card and then you'd also have a payment account field and it would default to whatever the default is for the credit card but you could override it at that point

Speaker 2  47:55
you're saying the default like Visa or MasterCard or whatever you have it set up per company right yeah sounds yeah

Speaker 2  48:13
so that would mean you have one primary your default would would be your primary checking account your primary credit card then you would have the option to select a

Unknown Speaker  48:29
lesser

Speaker 2  48:32
or credit card account or a different checking account getting on the situation right

Unknown Speaker  48:57
okay, so

Matthias Miller  48:58
then we've got that here and then

Matthias Miller  49:15
so then on the accounting transaction

Speaker 3  49:31
so then we have a company accounts, existing debit existing credit spected, debit, expected credit, difference, debit, difference credit.

Matthias Miller  49:51
And then to calculate the expected debit slash credit

Unknown Speaker  50:01
Use the following logic

Matthias Miller  50:13
when the purchase do POS have multiple payable accounts? Or is there just a single payable account

Unknown Speaker  50:32
those have multiple payable accounts.

Matthias Miller  50:36
Sorry, let me let me clarify. Does your Chart of Accounts counts have multiple payable accounts that that they can come out of? Or the things can be thank you

Speaker 2  50:58
so you're saying we'll have have only one accounts payable? Accounts Payable all be lumped together we're going to split it up into way we know Larry splits his up into one receive not vouchered and then the other one is vouchered or basically the one is more for organizing than anything else is.

Matthias Miller  51:28
Well, that's it

Unknown Speaker  51:33
sorry, there's something else

Matthias Miller  51:36
there's one step before that, even with receipt Okay, so first of all, well, let's answer that question actually, because I answered both questions. The plan currently is to have only one AP account not planning to support received that voucher subscriptions

Unknown Speaker  51:56
Yeah, because we we believe we have other reporting to organize that

Unknown Speaker  52:03
okay. The

Matthias Miller  52:06
Pio should not have any impact until it is received a new reception date is blank upon receipt, it should.

Speaker 3  52:32
Based on the company's default AP account

Matthias Miller  52:44
note the accounting impact should be p OE accounting impact should exclude any additional expenses that are linked to a Pio

Unknown Speaker  52:59
Okay then we have a

Speaker 3  53:09
create a vendor invoice accounting impact report it should have it this is a.

Unknown Speaker  53:41
Use this logic

Speaker 3  53:50
okay so we said oh

Matthias Miller  54:18
credit slash increase

Unknown Speaker  54:24
the counts payable

Matthias Miller  54:29
for the estimated amount from the PIO debit slash decrease the accounts payable account.

Unknown Speaker  54:39
Let's just say this.

Matthias Miller  54:42
Adjust the counts payable

Unknown Speaker  54:47
account

Matthias Miller  54:52
the actual invoice amount minus the POS estimated amount

Unknown Speaker  55:10
if it's linked to a Pio if it's

Matthias Miller  55:19
PTO debit slash

Unknown Speaker  55:24
wait this is

Matthias Miller  55:31
I have this wrong when you get the PTO we're going to AP is a liability which means you will

Unknown Speaker  55:48
get credited slash increase

Unknown Speaker  55:51
yeah Correct. Thank you so then

Unknown Speaker  56:16
so an asset we would debit liability we would

Matthias Miller  56:26
Oh, that's fun

Matthias Miller  56:34
I think about this right?

Unknown Speaker  56:38
I can't be

Matthias Miller  56:44
the accounts payable account by the amount of the invoice Okay, when the invoice is paid. We would debit slash liability debit slash decrease the accounts payable account and then we would credit credit the source account payment

Matthias Miller  57:19
both of these lead imports run nightly

Unknown Speaker  57:36
let's do this company

Speaker 3  57:45
knightly to accounting system model these after the building accounting Impact Report, consider including all of these a single symbol, it's really listed. All six. All right,

Matthias Miller  58:10
so

Matthias Miller  58:17
let me mark, do you want to?

Unknown Speaker  58:23
Well, let me send this over to you.

Matthias Miller  58:37
Seems pretty straightforward. Do you want to it's gone over to you in a minute or so hopefully? Do you want to review that now? Or do you want to take a chance to sit down with it? And let's take a look at

Unknown Speaker  58:50
it next meeting.

Speaker 2  58:54
No, we can do it now. I was joking. Well, I can take a look at it once it got here. But so thinking there was one step that we missed

Unknown Speaker  59:07
where let's

Speaker 2  59:13
get down to say it's a load of lumber. So we receive the load of lumber at that point it comes liability or it's payable which increases accounts payable by purchase order amount and it would at the same time it will also increase. Depending if it's materials or if it's if it's materials, it would increase assets in the amount that that do we have that step in there? We're increasing the assets. At the same time it increases liabilities.

Unknown Speaker  59:49
It would be maybe,

Matthias Miller  59:51
yes, it's tied to the I guess I don't know exactly what this is at. At some point we need to shift our POS to tying out to counting skews and I'm not sure. Or sorry, accounting, we have separate GL account. We've got two types of GL accounts one is just what we've been using previously and but we're going to need to tie those out to the new skews

Matthias Miller  1:00:26
that did not make sense. I am so sorry. We vendor invoices have their own set of GL accounts they get tied out to we will need to start tying out skews to somehow to GL accounts on the actual actually in the accounting system.

Matthias Miller  1:01:09
So

Unknown Speaker  1:01:14
expand on that further. I'm not I'm not following.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:20
Okay, so

Matthias Miller  1:01:23
currently on the on the verification report, there's an option for a lot of people to see going to skew on the SKU. Each SKU Currently it has a GL account, for example, Inc is tied out to administrative expenses, supplies and equipment. That GL account is its own thing, it's not tied out into the accounting system in any way. We need a way to map those across so that we can make accounting transactions and given the fact that I believe I believe we said we are going to have we're still going to have three separate accounting companies I think it means we need to have a per district map well. Let me cut to the bottom line bottom line is we need to figure out how we want to do that.

Unknown Speaker  1:02:31
That's the bottom line

Speaker 2  1:02:40
do we do we drive accounting transactions from the SKU level? Or be the what we call a SKU light SKU light level or do we drive it from vendor invoice line item level is that

Unknown Speaker  1:03:04
well is that

Unknown Speaker  1:03:05
it?

Matthias Miller  1:03:09
We do both currently and we need to continue doing that both currently but

Speaker 2  1:03:24
but so on the verification report that I sent to you last page of the but I had the agenda I had emailed to you that that would give us some I think that would would help us that

Unknown Speaker  1:03:48
let me put together if you

Unknown Speaker  1:03:53
and I have your we want to go through the your outline first

Matthias Miller  1:04:04
let me let me do let me do something here

Matthias Miller  1:04:39
I'm sending you a list of the current GL accounts so we can go through the outline Yeah, let's let's do that. Then we need to get this

Matthias Miller  1:04:57
so for for each dish Straight anytime we do this wouldn't have to be on the financial allocation record this could be on the district level

Matthias Miller  1:05:18
or it could be on the

Unknown Speaker  1:05:28
accounting company

Matthias Miller  1:05:33
it's not FDI is the problem

Matthias Miller  1:05:49
Dwayne, do you have an opinion where for some of these settings to map like payment type to accounting account where they should live

Speaker 1  1:06:06
you were putting a bunch of stuff on App posting settings or was it on admin

Matthias Miller  1:06:11
there's someone app hosting settings. The The weird thing is on the FTI financial allocations we would actually allow you to switch a disk district from one company to another if we wanted

Unknown Speaker  1:06:35
to.

Matthias Miller  1:06:40
Which makes me wonder about changing this from FTI financial allocation to something like

Unknown Speaker  1:06:46
district

Matthias Miller  1:06:56
district accounting settings or something and expanding it to not just be FTI stuff. Okay. Why

Speaker 1  1:07:10
would we allow you to change a district or an FDI financial allocation based on the company if you're in one company Why would you be allowed to change the district you're saying it's an editable screen report. Now

Matthias Miller  1:07:31
here's the scenario. Ohio is running their books in one account they want to three years down the road they want to completely redo their accounts

Unknown Speaker  1:07:41
and and so instead of

Matthias Miller  1:07:51
redoing the accounts in their current accounting system, I don't know why you would do

Unknown Speaker  1:07:54
this they they close out the old

Matthias Miller  1:08:01
account accounting company and create a new accounting company it doesn't make sense to me I think we push we link each district to an accounting company that should never change and then there are additional accounting settings on a per district

Unknown Speaker  1:08:16
basis for or the only thing we could do

Speaker 1  1:08:30
so currently some of that financial occasion so So some other stuff you have in okay, but backwards what where do we have user permissions based on settings based on App hosting settings?

Unknown Speaker  1:08:57
Some of this stuff I want to make sure

Matthias Miller  1:09:01
everybody can see it only admins can edit it

Matthias Miller  1:09:15
although I think this these accounting settings should actually shift over I think these need to go on the company record. I think it's an oversight that they're not there

Unknown Speaker  1:09:30
I do not disagree with that. Actually, I think it's called the builder record now.

Speaker 3  1:09:38
Somebody's renamed it well, these are these are core core settings. Okay, I

Matthias Miller  1:09:45
think it's so these would actually go on the accounting company.

Speaker 1  1:09:51
Oh, counting company. Okay, got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:09:56
yeah. Great. Ben Do you remember which email address includes includes Nike and crafters car at let me have the list here because the same no car would have

Unknown Speaker  1:10:26
or HD leads but also include nine

Matthias Miller  1:10:32
does do both include short no HD leads is that good tool?

Unknown Speaker  1:10:36
Yes they both they both concluded okay

Matthias Miller  1:10:41
I'm just going to do Ellis job

Unknown Speaker  1:10:48
counting company these from the settings to becoming the bliss okay so

Matthias Miller  1:11:13
okay so I'm gonna put in here

Matthias Miller  1:11:28
okay so I'm going to propose that this actually goes on the accounting company record

Unknown Speaker  1:11:55
okay

Matthias Miller  1:12:00
all right. That's a little niggling point as far as where that is. But basically for each accounting company we're going to say this vendor invoice payment type maps out to this default payment account

Unknown Speaker  1:12:11
so far so good mark. Yes.

Matthias Miller  1:12:19
On the vendor invoice we'll put in a payment account will default it to whatever it is or the payment based on payment type but lets you switch it to something else if you like. It warn if you try to save a paid invoice without a

Matthias Miller  1:12:39
with yeah award if you try to save it without without it set I guess

Speaker 2  1:12:53
okay, it's quick question go back up to the default payment account list of asset liability accounts into account

Unknown Speaker  1:13:08
so we are we not going to run everything through EP the accounts payable regardless of what it is or there's

Speaker 2  1:13:23
we ever have a copy to pay an invoice where we say $100 late always it Accounts Payable even if it's just minutes or five minute will always flow through Accounts Payable

Unknown Speaker  1:13:50
Accounts Payable first and then go to checking account or whatever the assets is where the money is actually coming from? Are we allowing

Speaker 2  1:14:11
me try again. So when we get an invoice to pay anytime we have any obligation to pay any anything whether we have an invoice or it's a verbal or whatever. I think there's two paths one can we I'm asking the question can we we always make so that it goes into accounts payable first. And then it comes out of accounts payable and goes to whatever come into account. Or can we go directly to say the payment account to the checking account and bypass Accounts Payable completely?

Matthias Miller  1:15:02
So what happens to your

Unknown Speaker  1:15:07
yes

Matthias Miller  1:15:10
okay, let's let's say let's talk plan integration you have a

Unknown Speaker  1:15:20
what's a good example?

Matthias Miller  1:15:25
I mean you got a monthly recurring fee for for $50 every month for a telephone answering service completely made up for lack of a better example and it's auto Bild and happens every month Do you require is that going to be coming from the builder? And and Or does the accounting team that should still show up in the as a vendor as a paid vendor invoice from that account? And you'd still chase down some verification process for that. So what you're saying

Speaker 2  1:16:15
good. Anyone? I would think it should have Yeah, some type of verification process. I mean, I think ideally, everything should go to Accounts Payable even if it's just for a very short period of time

Matthias Miller  1:16:41
I mean, in this case, it would it would just directly ultimately if it's already been paid it would just go away yeah, it would hit people but probably going through through AP sorry, that's unnecessary technical swallow

Matthias Miller  1:17:04
Is there any kind of automation

Unknown Speaker  1:17:13
Well, let's do this

Matthias Miller  1:17:20
vendor invoice

Unknown Speaker  1:17:31
let's go to

Matthias Miller  1:17:39
okay, if a payment type let's just do this. I believe we should be required if payment type is set

Unknown Speaker  1:17:54
given type of payment data set, is that reasonable?

Unknown Speaker  1:18:03
If you said

Matthias Miller  1:18:04
on the on the vendor invoice is it okay we would require the payment account to be to be set if you specify a payment type or you specify a payment date

Speaker 2  1:18:17
you specify then payment type a date you require what would we require

Matthias Miller  1:18:26
the payment account so so normally that would be copied straight off of the base on the payment type. But if you put in a new payment type or one that doesn't have a default and you'd have to fill that in before you can save

Unknown Speaker  1:18:41
and the payment type so it would default to

Unknown Speaker  1:18:52
default it either put a payment type of check or ACH would it would your payment account default to accounts payable and if you put in credit card it would default to

Unknown Speaker  1:19:07
credit card account yep

Speaker 2  1:19:15
any of you if it's a cash payment then it would default the petty cash Yes.

Speaker 2  1:19:34
Think so I'm trying to remember what Larry had said about ideally running everything through accounts payable and accounts receivable even if like other side but money coming in always run that through accounts receivable to keep it clean even if I think this would because we have Have counts payable the credit card account is also an accounts payable type or is a liability in your if it's cash then it never is Accounts Payable it's yeah I think that makes sense

Matthias Miller  1:20:26
yeah so we would our accounting transactions we could tie out to a purchase order or a vendor invoice for automation oh hang on one other thing wait I think we said this tax and freight and additional expenses are prorated.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:59
I'm sorry, you bring here let's go Why don't know.

Matthias Miller  1:21:13
Shipping tax and additional expenses are prorated on a per SKU basis right.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:20
Yeah, I wish I'd have an example in front of me yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:57
Just adding a note here. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:22:00
I wish I'd have an example in front of me but if you have a hypothetical if you have a have an invoice to a that has $1,000 worth of materials $50 worth of shipping charge and $70 of tax are accounts payable on that level to pay everything so

Speaker 2  1:22:33
that's $1,000 on the wages or the product 50 on the and just shipping surcharge and then Savin deal and tax. So your total liability so that goes goes to accounts payable and you're liable to pay $1,120 on that. So when the time comes to pay Accounts Payable goes to zero and her

Speaker 2  1:23:14
making account decreases by $1,120. But when you post it to your product and your shipping 1050 You're going to post that too

Speaker 2  1:23:42
you're going to post that to materials account wherever your materials are that's then this avenue you're going to pose to no no in this case when you're painted the full amount gets posted to Nevermind the tax it's on when it's when a customer pays us when we're receiving payment we're collecting that's that's our vendors problem to pay sales tax then.

Matthias Miller  1:24:42
Okay, so we would then have a purchase order accounting impact report that works like the building impact report shows the company transaction date the account the debit credit, the existing expected in difference debit and credit it and that would be used to create Delta transactions to sync accounting with the purchase order, we would have the same thing for the vendor invoice so at a very high level and then going in depth, so the PIO would not have any accounting impact until it's received ie reception date is blank. It's kind of confusing you based on reception based on reception date.

Unknown Speaker  1:25:31
Upon receipt, what that means is no, no keep building.

Matthias Miller  1:25:39
Upon receipt, we would debit slash increase the assets or the expense account for all received skews. And we would credit slash increase the AP account based on the default AP that was configured for AP find it was defined on the

Unknown Speaker  1:26:09
accounting

Unknown Speaker  1:26:21
Does that make sense?

Speaker 2  1:26:24
Yeah, that does I think we should. And word says the PIO should not have any impact until it is received at reception date is blank. There we're talking about product coming in. And the reception data is populated when we send in an order confirmation from the receiving location saying I received this product what I think we should also include what is the what's the trigger the trigger point on received for services? When is a like a code house invoice or an app post or a realty company or whatever? We don't actually purchase order but we

Unknown Speaker  1:27:15
is it at a very high level is it when owning receives the boys the vendor and goes to enter it into the accounting system? Yes.

Matthias Miller  1:27:32
Because 90% of the time it actually does need to be paid it actually is AP and it should hit the books right away and for those 2% of the time when it's for whatever point 5% I don't know what it is. When no that's not our invoice we're not going to pay that we'll we'll fix up the AP at that point.

Speaker 2  1:27:55
I think there's I don't know that there's a right or wrong I think there's different opinions on US aid received or do we use the date on the vendors invoice plan or just use the date received on a liquid what what Larry, I have some notes from that and I think using the date received makes the most sense because you could always make a case well, okay, that okay. So if a vendor offered so if the utility company has say get 2% net 10 discount and then you could make a case obviously their net 10 is going to be from

Unknown Speaker  1:28:52
eight they have on their invoice not the date that we entered into our accounting system so if we're wanting to track that way, I think we might be a good reason to enter it as of the

Unknown Speaker  1:29:11
Creation Date intersite

Unknown Speaker  1:29:18
don't know for sure on that I can go back and look at some of my notes and we just need to pick one one way I mean, that's more of a that is I don't think that needs to be specified here. Entering

Unknown Speaker  1:29:38
entering an invoice default would most would be today, but then entering it could always backdate it to the date it was marked on the invoice.

Matthias Miller  1:29:52
Do you want that transaction in the accounting system to be backdated?

Speaker 3  1:29:55
you

Speaker 2  1:30:06
can make some interesting things like if you if you've closed out a month and then you try to backdate one into that month. Yeah, I don't know. Let me ask around. I want to ask you and Larry how they letter is there's no right or wrong way. Okay, but am I correct that that would be it's not as much as it's a process and not a system? Correct? It doesn't affect the software system.

Matthias Miller  1:30:35
Software build very, very little

Unknown Speaker  1:30:44
use invoice data received I'll get an answer for you on that pretty quickly. Okay, sounds good.

Matthias Miller  1:30:57
All right, then jumping to a vendor invoice. If you enter a vendor invoice and link it to PIO, adjust the AP account based on the actual invoice amount minus the POS estimated amount for the I should have clarified for the invoice skews.

Matthias Miller  1:31:32
And then if it's

Speaker 2  1:31:33
not laid on the individual, that that would be if you were to look at your individual transactions and accounts payable that would nightly that would update that say, the purchase orders entered at $1,000. And then the invoice comes in at 1025. If the invoice is entered after that nightly update, it would reflect 1025 in AP instead of 1000. Right? Yes. It's an it's updating each individual transaction. It's not a Delta transaction for the whole I'm sorry,

Matthias Miller  1:32:17
everything was thinking it would actually be a Delta transactions. So you would have one Delta transaction for the PIO. One transaction for the PIO one transaction for the vendor invoice?

Unknown Speaker  1:32:44
Saying instead of have a delta transaction?

Matthias Miller  1:32:48
No, it certainly would. I was thinking it would be a Delta transaction.

Speaker 2  1:32:57
So if you do a Delta transaction, wouldn't the accounts payable that for that transaction remain at 1000? And then you'd have a delta transaction for maybe $592.

Unknown Speaker  1:33:15
simulated the aggregate total of different orders or vendor invoices?

Matthias Miller  1:33:26
Yeah, I mean, the alternative would be if we want to go down this route seems to me like six of one and a half a dozen of the other but the alternative for this would be to have the PIO lose any the impact for any of its skews that are tied to a vendor invoice. So the PIO only shows an impact for received but not invoiced skews.

Unknown Speaker  1:34:05
Okay

Speaker 2  1:34:12
Is it too simplistic to the PIO basically loses its value and is replaced with the invoice when invoice is entered? We do something like that or does that

Matthias Miller  1:34:26
cover for Yes,

Unknown Speaker  1:34:29
multiple invoices. Purchase Order.

Unknown Speaker  1:34:33
Now let's find all we do is

Matthias Miller  1:34:47
all we do is on the PIO. We debit and increase the s expense account for all received skews that have not been invoiced. Or for all skews that have have been received but not invoiced. And then we remove that line the first line under the vendor invoice and we always we always credit slash increased AP for vendor invoices by the actual invoice amount

Speaker 2  1:35:26
Oh, and you're saying we decrease first, when we get a vendor ID we use an example of $1,000 purchase order and then invoice comes in and it's actually 1020. So products received it goes into AP as $1,000 invoices three days later 1020 is entered and then decrease funds payable by $1,000 and then increase it by 1020.

Unknown Speaker  1:35:59
So and would you do the same thing on the asset accounts or wherever the asset or the expense accounts? While those would only increase $20 Okay, then you would even if it split out into multiple different GL accounts throughout you would decrease it by the purchase order amount and increase it by the vendor invoice amount.

Unknown Speaker  1:36:32
Correct? Yeah, I like it.

Matthias Miller  1:36:36
Okay, so another way to say it would be is the purchase order only impacts accounting between the time it's received and invoiced?

Unknown Speaker  1:36:47
Yeah, it's our best guess as to what the accounting impact is.

Matthias Miller  1:36:58
Yeah. Okay, so then on the vendor invoice, we credit and debit the AP account by the actual invoice amount we

Unknown Speaker  1:37:13
debit well here let's

Matthias Miller  1:37:18
debit and slash increase the asset expense account for all skews that have been invoiced. Also use on the invoice credit and increase the AP account by the actual invoice amount and then

Matthias Miller  1:37:43
let's make this simple if the invoice is unpaid and then if the invoice is paid the payment account the

Unknown Speaker  1:38:09
All right,

Matthias Miller  1:38:10
so then the invoice repeats the same logic of debits and credits debits slash increases the acid or expense account for all skews and then if it's unpaid its impact should be a credit on the AP account and if it's paid it should credit the payment account

Unknown Speaker  1:38:32
yes

Unknown Speaker  1:38:44
okay

Matthias Miller  1:38:47
good. So we're waiting on.

Speaker 2  1:38:53
Good. Well, your note of above note the pure accounting impact exclude any additional expenses that are linked to APO?

Speaker 2  1:39:07
Like to find purchase order that has an additional expense linked to it using thing that Nick created, it shows how that additional expenses are rolled into individual skews and all that and talk through that and I don't know that we need to a but maybe just to give update on what from you what why we're in excluding that

Matthias Miller  1:39:49
because the I mean bottom line is that other po Conversation on Monday maybe this is where we didn't land in the right place that other po will have its own accounting impact and gets paid separately.

Unknown Speaker  1:40:09
Oh,

Speaker 2  1:40:11
okay, you're talking about two separate invoices. One afraid invoice or something linked to product. Okay. But if okay, if it's we also have on additional expenses, we also have invoices that have

Unknown Speaker  1:40:30
the product. Here's a New York paint recovery charge of whatever additional expense but we roll that into the price of our paint or paints is more expensive in New York because we have to charge or sometimes it's a material

Unknown Speaker  1:40:54
cost fee would be Wow, that's debatable but a shipping surcharge. One of our vendors that are doing their own shipping that would not be excluded.

Unknown Speaker  1:41:08
This case correct.

Matthias Miller  1:41:11
And clarifying what you have. Perfect. Clarify the second line shipping tax and additional expenses not linked to APO

Unknown Speaker  1:41:23
just to clarify that a tad. Good,

Unknown Speaker  1:41:30
I'll get an answer. Get an answer for you soon on that use invoice data received date for an invoice

Matthias Miller  1:41:50
All right. So that means

Unknown Speaker  1:41:54
that

Unknown Speaker  1:42:04
I think that means

Matthias Miller  1:42:06
Okay, so I need to chase so the company settings. Okay. Big knotty issue that we still need to talk through is the GL accounts piece. We're over it depends how badly Dwayne wants to.

Unknown Speaker  1:42:28
Oh, okay.

Matthias Miller  1:42:30
Well, Dwayne, and I have Hey, let me take a breath. Dwayne. Do you want mark on that part of the call talking about payroll? Okay, can we please take a remark when are you heading out of the office

Speaker 2  1:42:47
I could probably go until after for I'd like to have a few minutes to

Matthias Miller  1:43:02
Can I take a Dwayne's got a payroll issue he needs to talk through if I can take a quick three minute break and we can come back to that

Unknown Speaker  1:43:12
yeah, let's do that. works.

Unknown Speaker  1:43:15
Okay, sounds good. We'll be right back

Unknown Speaker  1:43:41
then you guys sound like your brains have melted Yeah, okay. Well on that a little bit.

Matthias Miller  1:43:49
nearly as much as the brain work is Matthias is on

Speaker 1  1:43:54
it's kind of funny because I you can see exhaustion set in

Unknown Speaker  1:44:02
my head apparently just like thinking through too many variables by now.

Unknown Speaker  1:46:26
During my brain

Matthias Miller  1:46:27
is melted it's been melted since

Speaker 1  1:46:31
you walked up and i i sent I sent you yeah I started I said to Ben as you walked up I said you guys I'd like your brain has melted I FYI there is a there is a report I want to say it's in my personal folder that has GL accounts currently that that does exactly what you what you were looking at.

Unknown Speaker  1:46:55
Okay so no

Speaker 1  1:46:58
no no wait wait wait wait it's not Is it is it might not be it might be hold on I think I moved it. Let me go one sec. Counting No. User folder top top top folder accounting

Unknown Speaker  1:47:11
No Look at that.

Speaker 1  1:47:16
You can include or exclude active and you also see the notes Yep.

Matthias Miller  1:47:22
Let's do this is a PDF to your point about brain fried I hired an assistant two months in she's like you don't actually need an assistant you need a project manager

Unknown Speaker  1:47:41
like well you're not lying

Speaker 1  1:47:47
you know One thing's for sure project management

Unknown Speaker  1:47:54
is

Speaker 1  1:47:57
and people who love project management must be a special breed of people because they are can be a project specialist way too easy to

Matthias Miller  1:48:12
join that's probably what they say about you and I why we can't do project management are a special breed of people

Speaker 1  1:48:23
to that end to that I will say to all the project management people is you guys aren't visionaries. You need people to actually build projects to actually go create projects for you to manage because project managers are not people who go create projects there are people who project manage so it takes all types of make the world go round yes it does

Speaker 1  1:48:48
Okay, here's the here's the issue I just ran into we have crossover contact types with employees and drivers

Unknown Speaker  1:49:02
so

Speaker 1  1:49:05
So contact type so this isn't a test system by the way because we're yeah so if you go to a haulers is it I believe go to go to go to logistics. Yeah, so that is a contact type and I have crossover with employees and hauler contact types

Unknown Speaker  1:49:31
can it's fun?

Unknown Speaker  1:49:33
Yeah. So I don't know how we want to solve for this.

Unknown Speaker  1:49:39
We can

Matthias Miller  1:49:45
we run into this occasionally we could have a let's just make sure there's not

Unknown Speaker  1:49:59
I don't think we have this But

Matthias Miller  1:50:07
not like some kind of secret allow multiple contact types

Unknown Speaker  1:50:16
that the lame

Matthias Miller  1:50:17
but effective one is probably to have a case an identical contact for the employee but with a suffix or something.

Unknown Speaker  1:50:33
Oh, okay. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:50:36
so do you validate

Speaker 1  1:50:38
developed do you validate on display name what are we validate on?

Matthias Miller  1:50:43
Yes Display Name Wait a second oops even better I'm better This isn't configured Wait Why is this not configured the same way

Unknown Speaker  1:50:54
inside hang on hang on hang on keep on hanging Oh, I thought we had this we don't have it

Matthias Miller  1:51:17
Yeah, what you would do

Speaker 1  1:51:17
is you can you can do alternate Display Name override name and you could do Brian Weaver parentheses holler parentheses.

Matthias Miller  1:51:28
Either hauler or employee what I would say is employee is going to be less frequently visible

Unknown Speaker  1:51:35
and parentheses okay, I mean let me tell her

Unknown Speaker  1:51:44
Oh marks here

Unknown Speaker  1:51:53
Mark sorry just so you were waiting to get in

Speaker 2  1:52:04
on that what they do we use on an invoice Yes. Who said they're always using the date on the invoice for the reason of that you know, man 30 or net of 2% net 10 and think that that makes the most most logical i mean you you do have the things the thing was late you have to Armand but that's because we have

Matthias Miller  1:52:42
so the

Unknown Speaker  1:52:46
contact type so we have I don't know well okay. So makes so that was easy product

Matthias Miller  1:53:09
so, okay, so on a vendor invoice. If you when you enter a vendor invoice you backdate the accounting impact to the date of the invoice and work to the invoice date

Unknown Speaker  1:53:29
yes

Matthias Miller  1:53:35
and for a Pio Can we do the same thing except have it be based on reception date for invoice date it makes it a little complicated but we're gonna want to reverse the video on the same same date and that's one of the things that made it a little bit nicer to

Unknown Speaker  1:54:11
know

Matthias Miller  1:54:18
have the reversal happen on the invoice Oh, you could still do it this way. No, that's terrible. Well,

Unknown Speaker  1:54:27
okay, so when we're receiving Product

Unknown Speaker  1:54:41
Manager Adams increases our inventory the day it's received. Then we have you know, we have situations where it's received is

Unknown Speaker  1:54:53
but he checks it in then. The vendor invoice was dated the same day that the company shifted out I think it's services, using the date that the vendor has on their invoice makes a lot of sense. But then what

Unknown Speaker  1:55:16
don't want to already went through if we set it up to where

Speaker 2  1:55:26
we have reception date when we receive product, but then when we enter the vendor invoice and it's dated two or three days before that Epson date listed for the product, don't want it to write that.

Speaker 2  1:55:49
Wow, okay, I think we're clear that the date we enter the vendor invoice and the date that the product is, those two dates have to be the same. Right or wrong? Or would you agree or disagree?

Matthias Miller  1:56:08
Sorry, one more time, the date we

Unknown Speaker  1:56:13
sell. So we have

Speaker 2  1:56:19
dates, we have one where the PIO is received or the reception date. We received the product. And we have another date when it on the vendor invoice that impacts accounting. We would agree that those two dates need to be the same. We not if we don't then we have a lot of other stuff happening

Matthias Miller  1:56:47
that day date that we undo the PIO and the date that we that we enter the vendor invoice needs to be the same date. Yes, if we're having if we're splitting that to separate transactions, but it seems to me like what's the real advantage of having the PIO being the one that reverses itself instead of having the vendor invoice create the Delta? Or what's the accounting teams advantage for that?

Unknown Speaker  1:57:37
When you sit reversed the Delta you're

Unknown Speaker  1:57:45
all right, I did something I followed on that.

Matthias Miller  1:57:51
We're saying that a Pio impacts accounting from the time that it's received until the time that it's invoiced.

Matthias Miller  1:58:06
If we would go back to the original approach, and say the PIO impacts accounting as soon as it's received and the invoice impact impacts adjustment impacts accounting by adjusting the POS impact. Then we can backdate the vendor invoice to whenever we want to and everything is fine instead of needing to make sure those dates line up when those two adjustments happen.

Speaker 2  1:58:43
Oh so if if you had a if you had a Pio with all the knowledge of $1,000 and an invoice of 1020.

Unknown Speaker  1:59:04
And you date it to the purchase order with dated June 1 and

Unknown Speaker  1:59:17
invoice was dated June 3. Then on June 3, you would have an adjustment and accounting adjustment of late hours. But if it was the other way around then the invoice we have unpacked accounting for 1020.

Matthias Miller  1:59:43
Well, if there is no PIO, it would account for 1000 1020 If you receive the product after it's invoiced, so if you would, so if you if you get invoice on the first, then you would have 1020 impact And then if it gets if you get a PIO, that thing gets tied up to the vendor invoice, the PIO would get $1,000 impact. And the vendor invoices impact would drop to 20. And it would balance itself out.

Unknown Speaker  2:00:15
These sounds like some harebrained scenarios.

Unknown Speaker  2:00:21
Well, I, they aren't going to be real life scenario. So

Speaker 1  2:00:25
why would we what? Why would we ever have a vendor invoice without? What? Before I would we ever invoice a vendor? Or why would we ever create a vendor invoice record that that would have a Pio come later? That's kind of silly. I mean,

Speaker 2  2:00:40
well, we will if so, we receive products in like the week of July 4, and nobody's there to check it in until the following week. And the vendor invoice comes in with a

Unknown Speaker  2:00:58
and a 2%. Discount and stayed at the same day that it was shipped. So

Speaker 1  2:01:05
there's still there's still a Pio out there for it.

Speaker 2  2:01:14
To but does not impact accounting until it's received.

Matthias Miller  2:01:25
So you still have the vendor invoice it subtracts the the POS accounting impact, which is nothing. So it takes the full accounting impact. The Pio is received, which creates accounting impact for the PIO. And it takes responsibility for that portion of it. And the vendor invoice takes less responsibility for the impact. Once again, still balances balances each other out.

Speaker 2  2:01:52
Think it all makes sense. My brain is tired. And I feel like I can't I don't know. What if you

Speaker 1  2:01:58
just understand what you're trying to say and accomplish. But I think procedurally I think it's a very dangerous method.

Matthias Miller  2:02:15
So

Unknown Speaker  2:02:15
what data are you going to use when you enter a vendor invoice if you receive a vendor, a vendor invoice and the product showing not received yet, you should net

Speaker 1  2:02:33
okay. I care much more about the procedural side than I do the accounting side. And I would like to lock the cape, I would like to lock it where you can't do a vendor invoice that potentially has. What if if you have if you try to do a vendor invoice with a Pio that's not received yet. You can't do or sorry, you can't do a vendor invoice unless the product is received. And if you want to go and create a vendor invoice for a product that has a purchase order, and it doesn't show received yet, then get on the phone and figure out who it went to and get the thing done and received so that you can actually process your vendor invoice. This This feels a little bit like we're understand what you're trying to accomplish on the accounting side. But I would like to limit this fairly radical edge case to never happen in some way.

Speaker 2  2:03:27
But what are you going to do Dwayne if you if you have if you have that situation so the guy runs out and checks it in and it now shows received on day and your your invoice is already dated five days ago. date on the invoice that the vendor sent to us was already or 10 days ago.

Speaker 1  2:03:53
So you stated you're saying your accounting transaction it's going to be based on when the vendor invoice the invoice?

Speaker 2  2:04:01
Well, I think it needs to be because if the vendors all have typically all have terms like a net 30 Or a net 10 2% And if we unless we use that date

Speaker 2  2:04:27
we're just kind of using our discretion on when I mean we can't we can't tell a vendor. Well, we didn't. I don't think we can tell a vendor we didn't receive the product until five days after your invoice date. So we're gonna take that 2% Discount even 15 days after the date on your invoice

Unknown Speaker  2:04:52
but I would agree with you that you can't. You shouldn't be able to, to enter a vendor invoice

Unknown Speaker  2:05:04
and try to appear in searches.

Speaker 2  2:05:07
Yeah, you can. I don't know if you can even do that currently, but then when you can enter it, I think you should have the ability to backdate it to see that's on the vendor put on when the vendor created his invoice. Well, okay,

Speaker 1  2:05:27
excuse my ignorance for a second on how the technicalities of accrual accounting works. So understand that the purchase order impact having its impact at the time of reception that makes sense. From a vendor invoice side, are you required to have that impact the vendor invoice impact based on when the vendors invoice their invoice? And not necessarily when you pay it?

Speaker 2  2:06:00
Yeah, because when when they invoice, typically you become liable to pay you. That's when it becomes accounts payable. Yeah.

Speaker 1  2:06:15
So then, so then the potential exists that we will have numerous cases like this in the case of say UfP Saulsbury, which those times those timeframes are fairly tight. Where the product received is probably going to be after the invoice date actually was invoice from the vendor?

Unknown Speaker  2:06:37
Yeah, I think so.

Speaker 2  2:06:49
But I feel like this is something that we should put some examples together and I shoot off an email to Larry and ask him, What? Break it down. How are you doing this? What? What's a good? What have you found to be a good way to handle this? And

Unknown Speaker  2:07:06
that he has to say?

Speaker 2  2:07:13
Because you can't you need to know, on this massage, right, so that you can build for it correctly.

Matthias Miller  2:07:24
Yes. And I'm going to push just a little bit on this to make sure that mean, the impact reports are fine and dandy, and it's local, localized complexity, like it's not throughout the whole system, but they're still complicated enough that I would really like to keep them as simple as we can. If it seems to me, I mean, there are some some real questions that I think from an accounting perspective that should be raised is if you prepay if, if you pay something, if you okay, if you got a truckload of of lumber, and you pay for it, does that hit inventory at the time of payment or receive? And depending on the answer to that, that's going to significantly change our conversation here. Yeah.

Speaker 2  2:08:31
I don't know I, I had like when you receive something that's generally when

Unknown Speaker  2:08:40
good impact accounting. But then we're going with the vendor invoice. That can and will be at a different time points. So.

Matthias Miller  2:08:58
Yeah, I mean, is there is there something like an asset account for prepaid, you know, things that are paid for but not received or something like that? And if we do that, that might actually make the linking between these two accounts easier? Not sure yet. But yeah, you chasing that down with Larry figuring out what he has to say? Different discussion for another day, then is, which I can, Mark, if you want to put that on the agenda for, I guess, whenever it's priority for you to get to. But talking about GL accounts and how GL account should be linked out. That would be how to map GL accounts to the accounting system. Yep. Go ahead. Sorry.

Unknown Speaker  2:09:47
That map GL accounts to excuse.

Matthias Miller  2:09:51
No, we have two kinds of GL accounts. We have the GL accounts that I emailed you, which is what we're using now. This is what's because then we have. Yeah. And then we have the GL accounts that are in the chart of accounts in the accounting system.

Unknown Speaker  2:10:07
They can't be the same thing. Oh,

Matthias Miller  2:10:11
well, we are going to have three different companies. I suppose what we could do

Unknown Speaker  2:10:25
is

Matthias Miller  2:10:28
allow you to select one from one of the companies and then just have validation that that same, an account with the exact same name and number exists in all the other companies, that would be an option. Is that how we should handle it?

Unknown Speaker  2:10:44
Mark? Are we going to? Are we going to have district specific GL lists?

Speaker 2  2:10:51
No, I mean, that the plan is my thought my plan had been that we would have a universal list of GL accounts. And we would have some that would be universal. Some districts just would not use all the GL accounts that others for example, Lana does some church projects through vinyl structures for their church that require some specific GL accounts that we just would not use for the other two companies? was my thought, but are you saying that that they have to be different, we can't use MTL account each in each company

Matthias Miller  2:11:43
well, the Chart of Accounts will not technically be shared among multiple companies, so we'll basically just have it copies

Unknown Speaker  2:11:52
Okay, and that's fine, right?

Matthias Miller  2:11:56
Yeah, somewhere under the hood though, we're going to have to have some kind of I don't know we're gonna have to somehow make sure that those get tied out correctly and the linking happens appropriately. So we just need to figure out how we want to do that.

Speaker 1  2:12:15
So Matthias were you thinking we would we would maintain the the ledger accounts that are currently existing that we are tied with skews were you thinking we would maintain those

Matthias Miller  2:12:31
maybe and then just have those link out to the appropriate accounts reach come funny and have validation that those things link out correctly? Or I don't know. Like kindness I don't I don't have anything that jumps out at me and saying I have a much better idea

Speaker 2  2:13:11
so what do you need from me on that? That I think my brains about

Unknown Speaker  2:13:26
thank you guys

Matthias Miller  2:13:33
well, it's I think I think if you want to add it to discuss in the future i i think i think i have a proposal that will work fairly well. And there's multiple ways we could do this

Matthias Miller  2:14:00
Whoo. Here's what I like. Well, anyway, let's let's get on the list and talk about Okay.

Speaker 2  2:14:08
One quick question yet on yella Collins. Alright, to payroll. I think we discussed Monday. Anything, any updates on that or anything more on that?

Matthias Miller  2:14:25
Bottom line is we're gonna have approximately one of either Seth or Nick. Nick is heads down and another client project. Staff has been working on payroll, other payroll module stuff, it might not be done before when we want it to be done. Or the timeframe we were hoping for. But it's in the queue for development.

Unknown Speaker  2:14:54
Good. Good.

Speaker 2  2:14:58
So, Dwayne The payroll thing I'm assuming that was all taken care of for that was I thought that was what are you talking about?

Speaker 1  2:15:07
Yeah, so we the payroll issue was that we have duplicate contacts that we had to get around where, in the case of Eric Kurtz, myelin and Laverne who are haulers, which are our contact, or yeah, there's just a contact record. And now we want to make them an employee record and we're trying to use the same name. So we just, we just have to add, we added some to the display name, which is what's validated on and parentheses put a parenthesis around EMP notating and as an employee, so we'll have duplicate contact records, but it'll be you know, one will be an employee won't be a hauler, and we got around a name validation. Okay.

Speaker 2  2:16:00
Well, thanks, guys. I think we It feels like we covered a lot and also there's a lot more to cover.

Unknown Speaker  2:16:18
Read, good. Okay. Thanks, guys. Yep. Thanks. Are you dead yet? Do you want to?

Matthias Miller  2:16:36
Do you have anything you want to talk about? Ben, I think I think it's all we need you for week, eight into Dwayne. Dwayne in my regular regular meeting, CFO. So

Speaker 1  2:16:57
okay, first question. I sent you an email this early this morning, Josh. And I would like to get on a phone call with you Friday, somewhere between three and four o'clock, if possible, to talk about email and SMS, and chase him after that and see what well, he wants to he wants to kind of hear technically what direction you were wanting to go and how you want to, like, some of the technicalities of what your concerns were, etc, etc. anytime,

Unknown Speaker  2:17:25
any space in there, um, how much time do we need?

Unknown Speaker  2:17:34
I'm smart, you're smart and Josh's smarts? I'd say less than 30 minutes.

Unknown Speaker  2:17:36
Does that did I just

Speaker 1  2:17:40
did I just imply that there are other people that get on these calls that are not smart? Oops, that was probably not a good

Matthias Miller  2:17:46
one. Was Were you the one who was I talking to about what it's like not to be intelligent. Not me. I had a conversation with somebody recently about what it's like to not be not being Oh, I know. It was my officemate is was people who aren't intelligent don't don't actually realize that they aren't intelligent, and don't recognize the limitations of their lack of intelligence. And so it's not actually a pain to them. It's just

Unknown Speaker  2:18:11
they get stuck.

Unknown Speaker  2:18:21
Okay,

Speaker 1  2:18:22
so if that is true, okay. I'll be honest with you, right now I am struggling. And I am struggling with gait and feeling like one. Either you're not paying attention, or you're not intelligent. Or there's a whole bunch of oars that I cannot seem to lay my fingers on on
