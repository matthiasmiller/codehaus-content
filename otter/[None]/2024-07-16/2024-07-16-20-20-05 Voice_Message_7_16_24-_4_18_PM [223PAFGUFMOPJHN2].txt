Hey, so I think I understand your question. As I've shifted to do more sales this year and get out of marketing, I realized that I did marketing because I didn't think I could do sales and I thought marketing was more valuable than sales work. But as I've shifted to sales, sales is like effortlessly simple and way easier for me. And I also had belief that if I didn't work hard in the past, that what I was doing wasn't really valuable, that if I ironically, if looking back now, it was if I stayed in my utter zone of genius that came so effortless and easy that I dismissed its value. And so I think that's what I'm hearing from you, is belief around if it's easy, it's not valuable. If you make it look effortless, it's not valuable, and things like that, and so happy to go back and forth on this. But if that's the case, I would definitely lean into doing, finding your zone of genius, doing whatever is the easiest, most effortless thing that you can charge gladly for and go from there. So let me know your thoughts. You.
