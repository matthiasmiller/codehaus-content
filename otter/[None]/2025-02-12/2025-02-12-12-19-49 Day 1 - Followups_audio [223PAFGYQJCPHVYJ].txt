Did you know that up to 80% of leads convert after the fifth contact, too many salespeople give up after just two or three attempts, leaving money on the table. Let's talk about why follow ups are the single biggest missed opportunity in sales, and how you can make the most of them. Let's get clear, when a prospect goes silent, it's rarely because they don't want to hear from you. Most of the time they're just busy or overwhelmed. Maybe their dog is sick. They got distracted by fantasy football, or they have 50 other tasks piling up. Silence doesn't mean No, it means they're focused on other things. One of the top salespeople for one of my clients would tell his colleagues, I'm not afraid to call my leads like a debt collector. They reached out to me for a reason. I intend to find out why. Here's the data. A study attributed to Harvard suggests a majority of deals close after the 12th follow up. Another stat says 80% of leads convert after the fifth contact yet most salespeople quit following up after only two to three attempts. Why does this matter? Because every time you reach out, you're building familiarity and staying top of mind. That's essential in a busy world where everyone's juggling 1000 things. I can't tell you how many times I've heard from clients. I've been in touch with this person for two years, and they finally bought all it took was reaching out consistently to the prospect and making sure they didn't disappear. The moral of the story is that it has nothing to do with being rejected or ignored. Life just gets in the way. So how do you follow up effectively? Here are a few quick strategies. One, set follow up dates. Put every lead into a simple system, spreadsheet, CRM, even a notebook, and assign them a next follow up date. Consistency is key. Two, adapt your methods. Don't rely just on on way to communicate. Use phone calls, texts and emails, meet people where they prefer to communicate. Three, personalize your message, reference the last conversation or something specific about their situation. Show you remember who they are and what they need. Four, offer real value. Every follow up should have a purpose, share useful information, ask a specific question or provide an update five know how to pace it. Don't be afraid to be proactive, especially in the first week. From experience, I can tell you that you won't get many complaints, even if you're reaching out multiple times a day for the first week. From there, you can space out your follow ups weekly, then bi weekly, then monthly, etc, until they say no or not. Now, if you never hear a no, you still have a potential Yes. Also remember, a no is a good as a yes because it lets you focus on the prospects who are ready and interested to buy. Here's today's homework. Build out your follow up system to make sure that you never lose track of a lead. If you're using the shed Titan CRM, ask for more information to make sure you're making the most of it. If you're using a different CRM, talk with your sales manager. We've helped people like you improve their follow ups in other CRMs, remember the lead reached out to you for a specific reason. If a lead hasn't flat out rejected you, it means the conversation isn't over. Use those stats to remind yourself that patience and persistence pay off. Commit to a follow up system and you'll be miles ahead of the competition that stops trying after just a few attempts, you're not pestering your prospects. You're simply helping them manage their busy lives. You're simply ensuring they have every opportunity to get the solution they need. Keep following up until they say yes or no, your close rates will thank you.
