Welcome to today's training on tone matching and customer mirroring. Sales isn't just about giving information, it's about connection. The best salespeople know how to connect with the customer, and you can make that easier by adapting your tone, pace and language to match them when done right, it builds trust and confidence, making it easier to guide the conversation toward a sale before you even pitch a product, you need to understand who you're talking to. Customers have different communication styles, and if you don't adjust, you risk losing the sale before it even starts. Let's go through three common customer types and how to adapt your approach. Let's talk about the direct buyer. No small talk. These customers just want to get straight to the point. They'll ask things like, how much does this cost? If we start the conversation with a long winded explanation about features, customization and company history, we've already lost them. Instead, we need to match their tone and answer their question first by leading with direct answers. We show we respect their time and keep them engaged. If they ask for a quote, Don't over complicate it. Give the number, then say, Would you like a breakdown of options, or do you already know what you're looking for? This keeps the conversation flowing on their terms. The second one is the storyteller. They are emotion driven and relationship focused. These customers need to talk through their decision. They'll tell you why they're shopping, share personal details and want to feel heard for these customers, tone matching is crucial. If they are excited and animated, match that energy. Give them an ear for their stories. Laugh with them. If they are soft spoken and careful, slow down your pace to match theirs. For example, if someone says, I just moved and I finally have space for my dream woodworking shop, don't just say, great and jump into a pitch. Instead say that's amazing. What kind of woodworking do you do? Let's make sure your shed has the right setup. Do you need extra outlets or a reinforced floor? By engaging with their story and asking targeted questions, we're guiding them toward a sale without pushing them. The third one is the hesitant buyer. This person needs reassurance before committing. Some customers aren't ready to buy yet. They want to, but something is holding them back. Maybe it's trust, uncertainty, or the fact that they can't see the product in person. Maybe a customer says, I don't know. I feel like I should see it in person first. Don't argue or dismiss their concern. Instead mirror their hesitation and say that makes sense. A lot of our customers felt the same way at first. Are you more focused on the appearance, or is storage space the main concern? If they want to see a building in person, you can invite them to your location to see a similar building. You can also reassure them, we offer free material samples and 360 degree video walkthroughs. Would that help by providing a solution instead of pressure, you build trust and credibility. Here's how I encourage you to put this into practice. First, which of these is your natural style. Are you the direct buyer, the storyteller, or the hesitant buyer? Second, think back over the last few calls that you've had. What kind of buyer were they? Third, take some time doing some role plays with the different kinds of buyers. At the end of the day, the best salespeople don't rely on scripts. They rely on connection, active listening and adaptation. Here's how you can apply this in every conversation. Match your customer's tone, speed and communication style. Use the seven key questions to uncover their real needs, adapt your responses to build trust and confidence. Never rush, guide the conversation naturally. That's it for today. Let's go sell more buildings.
