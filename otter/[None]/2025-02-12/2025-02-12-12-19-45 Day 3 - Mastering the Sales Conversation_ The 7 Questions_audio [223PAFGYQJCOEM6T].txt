Hey everyone, welcome to this quick training session on mastering sales conversations. Whether you're new to sales or have years of experience, how you ask questions and engage with customers determines your success. The right questions build trust, qualify leads faster and guide the conversation toward closing without being pushy. Today we're going to cover seven key questions that will shape your sales conversations and help you control the process. The first question is, What can I help you with? This question opens the door to a natural conversation while demonstrating genuine interest. Sales isn't about jumping into features and pricing. It's about making the customer feel heard. Asking this question first sets the tone. It's open ended, and that's key. If you let the customer talk, you'll quickly understand their pain points and goals, and remember pause after you ask, let them fill the space. The second question is, what are you using this building for? When you ask about the purpose of the building, you move the conversation away from price and into real needs. Someone using it for simple storage will have different requirements than someone setting up a home office or workshop. Your job guide them toward the best solution. If they say, I just need storage, you might respond, got it. Are you looking for long term durability or just something temporary? This keeps them engaged and forces them to think deeper, giving you more information to work with. The third question is, how important are looks to you versus usability? This is a great discovery question, because it gets customers to reveal their priorities without them realizing it. If they say, I want it to look great in my backyard, you guide them toward higher end options and customization. If they say, I just need it to function, you focus on durability and efficiency. If they hesitate. Reframe the question. Some people prioritize looks because they want it to match their home. Others just need the best value for storage. Which way are you leaning? The fourth question is, how quickly do you need this? This question does two things. One, it tells you how urgent their need is. Two, it gives you an opportunity to move the sale forward. If they say, I need something soon, you pivot to in stock options or fast turnaround solutions. If they say I'm planning ahead, you lock in pricing and explore customization. Either way, it subtly moves them toward a decision without sounding pushy. The fifth question is, how important is price to you? Price is always a factor, but this question lets you gage how much weight it carries without making it the centerpiece of the conversation. A little humor makes it comfortable for them to answer honestly. If price is a concern, you position value, you can say something like, got it. We have options that maximize quality while keeping costs low. Let's find what works for you. The sixth question is, are you wanting to purchase outright or finance? A lot of people don't realize financing is an option, so bringing it up naturally helps remove objections before they arise. If they lean toward financing, you now have a clear path to move forward. If they prefer to buy outright. Great. You've just solidified the budget discussion. The final step is to answer with a solution. Once you've asked the right questions and they've told you what they need, don't leave them hanging. Your response should always be solution based, okay, based on what you told me, needing this fast, keeping it durable, and wanting it to look nice in your yard, I'd recommend and then fill in the blank. Let's get that started for you today. This reinforces their own words, making it easier for them to commit and then ask for the sale. Would you like to go ahead and lock this in? Or shall we set up delivery for you? People like clear next steps, so lead them there if they aren't ready to buy. Work with them to set up a timeline for you to talk again. Sales isn't about pushing a product. It's about leading a conversation and guiding your customer toward the right decision. These seven questions help you establish trust, qualify the lead faster, make the sale feel natural. The key Be confident. Be curious, be helpful. Start using these in your calls today, and you'll notice the difference. Here's your homework assignment. First put steps somewhere you can easily see them, whether it's a sticky note on your monitor, a note on your phone or a printed sheet. Second, call into the role playing number and run through a quick call. Practice is everything. The more natural it feels, the easier it will be when talking to real customers. Thanks for tuning in. Now, go make some sales.
