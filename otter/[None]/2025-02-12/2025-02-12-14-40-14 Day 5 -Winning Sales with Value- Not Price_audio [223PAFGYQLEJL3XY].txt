Let's talk about a challenge every shed sales person faces customers focusing only on price, if the only thing that makes us different is a number on a quote, we're stuck in a race to the bottom. But the good news that doesn't have to happen today, we're going to break down three things, how to differentiate effectively so customers see our value, how to sell based on benefits instead of just price, how to overcome objections before they even come up. If we get this right, we won't just close more sales, we'll close better sales at better margins. Most companies say they're different based on quality, customer service and integrity. Sound familiar? It should, because it seems 90% of shed businesses say the exact same thing. So if every company is saying the same thing, then are we actually different? This is where many salespeople get stuck. They assume differentiation is about what we say or what we offer, but Words are cheap. What actually matters is actions in shed sales, especially online shed sales, customers can't touch the product. They don't get to feel the wood, see the build quality, or check out the craftsmanship in person. So their entire buying experience comes down to how they interact with us. The good news this is where we can win. Customers don't just remember what we say. They remember how we make them feel. That's why our actions become our differentiation. Here's what actually makes us stand out. Number one, responding faster than the competition. Some companies take hours or days to follow up. If we call or text within minutes, we immediately set ourselves apart. Number two, listening, not just selling. Customers don't want to be pitched at. They want to feel understood. Number three, following through on commitments. If we promise a quote by noon, we send it by noon. Reliability builds trust. When customers see that our actions match our words, we automatically differentiate ourselves. They start thinking if they're this responsive. Now, imagine how easy they'll be to work with after I buy. Now let's talk about price objections. Here's the reality, when customers push back on price, it may be because they don't see the value yet, or because they literally can't afford it. If they believe every shed is the same, of course they're going to go with the cheapest one. So our job isn't to convince them to pay more. Our job is to make sure they see what they're actually getting. Here's how we do that. Number one frame pricing in terms of value. Instead of just saying this shed is $5,000 break it down. This includes premium materials, a 10 year warranty, free delivery, and no hidden charges. This shifts the focus from cost to benefits. Number two, let them compare against lower quality buildings. This takes some guts, and you might not always want to take the risk, but sometimes you can send customers to an unmanned lot at a big box store. When they see how thin the floors are and how weak the walls are, they just might give you a call back. Number three, ask the right questions. Instead of waiting for price objections, we lead the conversation using the seven question framework. These questions get customers thinking beyond price before it becomes an issue. Here's your homework assignment for today. Write down three things that actually differentiate your sheds from competitors. Avoid generic phrases like quality or customer service. Instead, list things customers can see, hear or experience, like faster lead times, thicker floors, warranty or even just the way that you make them feel. Just make sure these are things that are unique to you that your competitors don't offer. All right, let's recap. To win more shed sales at better margins, remember these three things. One, people will remember you for how you make them feel. Two, don't just rely on words. Quality service and integrity only matter if customers can see them in action. Be faster, more attentive and more reliable than the competition. Three, frame pricing around value. Show customers what they're really getting. Show how it meets the needs of what they're using it for. This way, price is no longer the only factor. When we do this, right? Customers don't just buy from us. They trust us, and when they trust us, price stops being the biggest concern. That's how we close more sales and build long term success. Thanks for watching and happy selling.
