Speaker 1  00:37
Hello Hi everybody Oh again

Unknown Speaker  00:42
we both have new backgrounds How about that?

Matthias Miller  00:45
Hey look at that exactly

Unknown Speaker  00:47
not work on the go I love it

Matthias Miller  00:50
exactly right exactly right

Speaker 2  00:55
I'm excited to learn this stuff with Active Campaign as I say definitely I'm not I'm by no stretch or professional in marketing whatsoever but I always grabs my interest like every stinking time well sounds good. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  01:15
me too. So I'm going to share my screen for starters and full transparency this might be a little bit of a

Unknown Speaker  01:25
figured out as we go

Matthias Miller  01:27
yep, exactly.

Unknown Speaker  01:36
We're gonna do this internal sales team and then restricted to give you guys access to that as well. Marketing Okay, so we have or it's really scheduling promotional emails. Okay, so

Matthias Miller  02:06
we're gonna start with number one

Speaker 1  02:12
see gotta figure out where is this how to update this person a salesperson, this one give you access to this one as well so you can open it so not only do you get a sneak peek into into this, but you also get a sneak peek into the backend of the system

Matthias Miller  02:41
and how these things work behind the seats

Speaker 1  02:51
Hey, and I think I out there it is. Okay, so here is

Matthias Miller  03:01
just to confirm these are you guys's new sales message

Unknown Speaker  03:04
numbers? Is that right?

Speaker 2  03:06
Scream? I'm squinting. I see mine, too. Oh, I believe that is Tori's I can check in discord. I think she left me a message with you.

Unknown Speaker  03:19
Let me just pull it up. While you do that, I can also see if I can pull it up over here. account numbers.

Speaker 2  03:30
We are messaging with Nick on those on 14 So she left it in that thread. Let me find it.

Unknown Speaker  03:40
Oh I'm seeing

Speaker 2  03:42
looks different 5564 714 So that number might be needing to be updated in

Matthias Miller  03:56
a little confused though because I'm seeing

Speaker 1  04:02
she has two local numbers. Okay.

Matthias Miller  04:10
So I'm seeing the 975 ones.

Unknown Speaker  04:13
Sorry, what was Which one did you see?

Speaker 2  04:16
I am looking in discord just in a chat with Nick Toria and I to set up call forwarding.

Unknown Speaker  04:26
And what was that one?

Speaker 2  04:33
I believe. Okay, so Tory says My number is 336-930-9751.

Speaker 1  04:43
So yes, that would be that would be this one. Okay, so wondering what this one is.

Unknown Speaker  04:53
What is the second number you're saying?

Matthias Miller  04:55
There's one ending and 6636 that

Unknown Speaker  04:59
is Is that I don't know

Unknown Speaker  05:05
medieval history we just do this

Unknown Speaker  05:18
this wonder if when when we set our accounts up

Unknown Speaker  05:27
there might be two

Matthias Miller  05:33
okay, so either way, these are the right numbers. Yeah, this is good. So

Speaker 1  05:40
step one is going to be update Active Campaign to match assist. Note, this should be done the evening, this should be done before the let's say this until this is automated this should be done before each

Matthias Miller  06:10
email

Unknown Speaker  06:14
goes out so

Matthias Miller  06:21
so you'll go over here and you'll hit download CSV it's gonna download this as a CSV file. Then

Unknown Speaker  06:31
other thing I gotta figure out oh goodness, no gotta figure out user permissions as well. users in groups

Speaker 1  06:50
going to go ahead and might be a little premature, but I'm gonna go ahead and see online sales promos. Now All right, so let's go back to these lists. Contacts. lists. And see, welcome. That's what we want. We're all the other

Unknown Speaker  07:31
any team they created? 12 Eight, that's definitely the one. Okay, so I think all you need is is maxlend. Anyway, I don't know if it matters.

Matthias Miller  07:46
I'm not sure if Ohio is actually using this or not, but Okay, okay, cool. Let's edit this. Okay, so permissions here. Lists. You don't need to edit lists campaigns. for permission to campaign subscription forms, you don't need templates. You don't need deals,

Unknown Speaker  08:07
accounts. No.

Matthias Miller  08:11
Contacts. I think we said we gave you permission. I'll compare that with the other one. Actually, hang on,

Speaker 1  08:19
I'm not sure. We look at what the other one is. Sure. Reports. I need a way to copy.

Unknown Speaker  08:30
Right, just take the permission.

Speaker 1  08:36
Campaigns. Contacts, add, add and edit, add edit and tags. Okay. Alright, so this one here, we say we need to but that's probably not going to be quite enough. So we need to add, edit.

Matthias Miller  08:58
Manage segments, you're going to need to manage custom fields and manage tags.

Unknown Speaker  09:02
Alright, so let's try that and then move you over to that one.

Matthias Miller  09:18
All right. Theoretically, that should give you all the permissions now to import it

Unknown Speaker  09:24
back here.

Speaker 2  09:49
Is this every time we import it, we would be essentially overwriting the existing contact list. We would be or would it only add me Even context

Matthias Miller  10:01
it's updating custom fields in the contact list

Unknown Speaker  10:06
custom fields in on the

Matthias Miller  10:11
here on the contact we have good question

Unknown Speaker  10:18
we have fields for that general details

Matthias Miller  10:24
salesperson and salesperson phone number and opportunity status got it and so we're going to import those input values for those so that we can segment by those audiences so to

Matthias Miller  10:48
so you'll go ahead and import from file go back to downloads and you'll

Speaker 1  10:55
do that and then map these across to salesperson salesperson phone number

Matthias Miller  11:07
or if there's a way to set the column heading the debt automatically

Unknown Speaker  11:10
default set correctly

Matthias Miller  11:14
maybe not and then

Unknown Speaker  11:17
opportunity status that's cool under the is the steam importing web hooks it's fine trigger automations is fine ink create field options don't I think you can uncheck? Actually, I don't know that that actually well doesn't matter. That really doesn't matter. That's fine actually. Alright, and so that's it Okay,

Speaker 2  12:54
so that's the preliminary making the two databases match before we would appreciate a campaign okay

Matthias Miller  13:02
so now it's running running running good.

Speaker 2  13:05
Can you visually go back to the tab on assist where you pulled the record from and created the CSV file was here okay and it's tied to this contact report Cool.

Speaker 1  13:17
See if I can run no new permission community is

Speaker 2  13:46
yep, I can get it nice.

Unknown Speaker  13:51
So then um, if you want to view report

Matthias Miller  14:15
and then partially succeeded rows

Unknown Speaker  14:22
unsubscribe

Matthias Miller  14:23
will not be imported into lists, which is good. That is and then on exclusion list. I'm not sure why those are the exclusion list but they are so okay. I don't think it really matters but in case you care to look on the outcome of that, so then

Speaker 1  14:44
that is that piece. Now let's go to let's see. Radio I understand. Now that's why

Matthias Miller  15:10
Alright, so we would like to Jonathan and I would like to do a little bit of Fibonacci with our audiences. And so for people who got we would like to exclude the ones who got the November promo, and then hit the November folks again in January

Unknown Speaker  15:34
rather than back to back promotions.

Unknown Speaker  15:39
Didn't everyone get the November promo?

Matthias Miller  15:43
Yes, but so basically, we'd be all new leads since about mid November. We will be doing the December promo to only lead since about mid November.

Unknown Speaker  15:53
Yeah. Sounds good.

Unknown Speaker  15:56
So

Matthias Miller  16:03
we'll go to campaigns.

Unknown Speaker  16:05
Okay. And all right, let me actually, I wonder if it's easier to might actually be easier

Matthias Miller  16:29
to set up wondering if I can set up segments separately, separately from this and it might be easier to actually set up a segment

Unknown Speaker  16:36
first. So let's just list exclusions. Sure. That is

Speaker 2  16:54
what is a segment. I see that that's a part of the campaign.

Matthias Miller  16:58
Yes, a segment is a dynamic filter. Think of it like the search criteria search that says what portion of the list are you emailing? Okay. I was thinking there might be an easier way to

Unknown Speaker  17:17
way to create a shared segment easily but it looks like there's not so we go to campaign

Unknown Speaker  17:26
this is how to create an advanced search

Unknown Speaker  17:35
it's some contact, this could actually be contacts can

Matthias Miller  17:52
Oh, save something. Okay. So you just do a contact search. Okay, that's, that's easy.

Unknown Speaker  17:57
It's an advanced search.

Matthias Miller  18:00
Yep. So do the Advanced Search. So we'll do so here's what we would see.

Speaker 2  18:07
It would be under Custom contact fields, right? Because we have the date stamped there or date created maybe

Unknown Speaker  18:16
what I'm wondering is who do we Yes, but can I

Matthias Miller  18:34
guess we would just do a date subscribed is honor after and the date of our last promo would have been

Unknown Speaker  18:47
let's do this November

Matthias Miller  18:56
12. To quote so anybody on the third honor after the 13th

Speaker 1  19:02
Right. Nope, not that there's my calendar. Wait, now except we did a follow up on Monday, the 15th.

Matthias Miller  19:21
Okay, and then also and the custom contact field

Unknown Speaker  19:28
the salesperson

Matthias Miller  19:36
is not blank. Because we we may have people in this list that are assigned to Yep. Yeah. Opportunity status

Unknown Speaker  19:47
is. Not should be all. We don't want one

Speaker 2  19:54
looting. Lot. We're excluding last and work excluding or leaving abandoned because some of them if they were springtime people

Unknown Speaker  20:11
abandoned?

Matthias Miller  20:11
Okay, so

Speaker 2  20:13
can you change that? Matthias, can you change that to one instead of sorry? Okay, so that segment is created.

Matthias Miller  20:24
This is what's not created actually just ran the search just to see but there's the search. Okay. All right, so then we add a new segment group. And this one would be, that's not what I do.

Unknown Speaker  20:38
Yes, that group,

Matthias Miller  20:40
Steve as segment, and this would be 2022 12 promo is the naming convention I've been using. Okay. So let's actually, before we do that, let's

Matthias Miller  21:05
let's just document these dates subscribed is

Speaker 1  21:17
salesperson is not blank, opportunity status is not lost, and is not one.

Matthias Miller  21:25
Save this as a segment

Unknown Speaker  21:29
named. So there's a

Matthias Miller  21:50
so the fantastic thing about this is that this is old hat to you, but we run the

Unknown Speaker  21:59
important it will update appropriately. Nice. Good. Wow.

Matthias Miller  22:10
And we can see all of these guys we've had. Sorry, this is random at the moment, I might send out an email. But I would love to know some time. It's probably too early to get exact numbers, but about how many leads per day for how long do you need to build your pipeline? And how many leads per day on an ongoing basis do you need to maintain your pipeline? And at what point you know in terms of lead flow versus you in Tory's capacity.

Unknown Speaker  22:46
Are you at 20

Matthias Miller  22:49
at 200%?

Speaker 2  22:51
Yeah. It's so odd to answer that question, because I have thought of that too. I've been like, Mike, what's the capacity issue here? Like I kind of freaked out a little on Monday morning when we had like 16 Each to follow up on, but they are not a qualified lead. So that's what makes me

Unknown Speaker  23:14
I'm like, Well, I

Speaker 2  23:15
can take double that if if one out of 16 is a qualified lead and a sale will then send me 30 so that we get two sales out of that bundle of time is interesting. Yeah. Do you have any? Is that a question we could ask? I've been thinking about the call with Eric coming up in January.

Matthias Miller  23:41
It might be it might be a good question for that. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  23:45
We should also, I don't know if you want to do this.

Matthias Miller  23:49
If if actually let me let me. Let me do this because I want it living in my in my drive.

Unknown Speaker  24:00
No, not that one.

Speaker 2  24:01
Something I noticed. I'm noticing right now just in observing this full master list is the massive difference I see in Tori's leads in my leads is how long I've been holding on to the leads. I'm holding on to leads for a long time. I think Tory has either a better feel for qualifying them just based on her conversations or she's more comfortable sending sending the lead to an abandoned status and then kind of moving on and looking at the next batch. I bet she's really probably refined that skill with her background in recruiting, I would imagine. Yeah. There's definitely a big difference in the volume there.

Unknown Speaker  24:47
That's interesting.

Speaker 2  24:49
I'll be something I'd want to talk with her about about, you know, how does she know?

Unknown Speaker  24:54
Put it there? What kind of triggers It's really interesting yep

Speaker 2  25:09
sorry I followed you down that rabbit hole. I know it was during like a wandering

Matthias Miller  25:16
dangerous dangerous territory. Okay so now we have a segment we have 200 people that we're going to be emailing as of now so then we go into the campaigns so then so I'm going to set the first one and the new we can switch the screenshare you can set the second one make sure you've got access to what you need

Speaker 1  25:43
okay alright so 2020 to 12 promo let's see 2020 promo let's do this one So then next

Matthias Miller  26:26
I'm confused why this list only has

Unknown Speaker  26:33
giving you that new segment

Unknown Speaker  26:36
will actually hang on

Unknown Speaker  26:41
Oh, it's filtered

Unknown Speaker  26:44
I'm confused why I think why is this why is this Alright, let's go back I want to I want to understand this

Matthias Miller  26:55
so the list is showing only this many items but the actual contacts we have

Speaker 1  26:58
more than that in there quite a few more than that list not any list and see what's not in any list

Speaker 2  27:18
that is that is one that just popped in my email before our call

Unknown Speaker  27:23
Okay

Unknown Speaker  27:27
Are they on a sync the size remember how I had it turned on let's go to but if we don't have first names

Speaker 1  27:47
take six weeks to go back to the inside Active Campaign so there's that one. So why did it not come in from the type form document in on November 11.

Speaker 2  28:13
Does the abandoned status restrict it from coming in? Like does it pull it from our list if we've changed the status and

Matthias Miller  28:23
it should come in immediately as soon as they fill in the form I thought it's a little baffling I mean it's

Unknown Speaker  28:32
true point form so this one was was going into a customer record go into communications so

Matthias Miller  28:59
it means this person would never have gotten the auto responder

Unknown Speaker  29:01
right well that's a problem

Unknown Speaker  29:09
for November okay.

Unknown Speaker  29:12
Yeah. Um let me do this. Jonathan, did you do auto here let's

Matthias Miller  29:24
Okay, so that means we're gonna have to do do this

Unknown Speaker  29:31
guy's name geo or something

Unknown Speaker  29:36
to tinker

Unknown Speaker  29:48
in Carlo Giancarlo. Well, I oh that's interesting because his, his import name is in assist which Maybe Tory added but

Unknown Speaker  30:04
his name's not in Active Campaign

Matthias Miller  30:10
yeah his name came in through the lead form though

Unknown Speaker  30:13
yeah

Matthias Miller  30:16
we can always use the name and assist right there's no oh yeah

Unknown Speaker  30:22
no reason not to okay so let's do this we're gonna change we're gonna change this to first name salesperson salesperson own just be consistent hold this opportunity status alright so then download it

Speaker 2  30:53
did it the customer's last name is that important or that that's not really important and matches their email we

Matthias Miller  31:00
could import we could import their

Unknown Speaker  31:03
cyclic with their last name looks like

Matthias Miller  31:09
there is ever a time though the email only gets included under full name we can do the

Unknown Speaker  31:14
last thing that's not a problem. Okay so then that one Okay, so then back here another tab import this one should be Gregg is a bad example because apparently we repeat it there's tow let's do this

Speaker 2  32:19
I almost wonder if this is a duplicate entry. So occasionally I'll get an email that will say you have X number of possible duplicate entries. And it's just like a warning. It's kind of like an auto generated looking email from assist and there's nothing really there's not much else to it. It's just the a number and I'm wondering if these non subscribed are possibly duplicate entries.

Matthias Miller  32:57
Yeah, but the reason I think not as the contacts in

Speaker 1  33:03
Active Campaign are keyed off of email address and so okay. It would be impossible for them to contact because it'd be yeah for them for there to be duplicates. That sense. Okay, so did

Matthias Miller  33:22
I now. Alright, so that then gives us last name is specified. I don't really know how much it matters but there it is. I don't typically use it in our contacts or in our emails but okay, so then we do

Speaker 1  33:38
first name last name sales salesperson salesperson opportunity phone number I mean opportunity status did existing

Unknown Speaker  33:55
let's do that. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  33:59
Select lists.

Matthias Miller  34:01
You know what? You're right.

Speaker 1  34:03
We should it should go under 2.2 point. Oh welcome that might actually trigger the auto responder for them Okay, so there's that that's running campaigns. First time draft. Yeah, we're seeing but let's let it run and see me. Come in here.

Matthias Miller  35:18
The total aside, I've been surprised at the average ticket price of online sales. Me too.

Unknown Speaker  35:25
And a great way. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  35:29
exactly. It is

Speaker 2  35:43
disappearing with bias. So I'm refreshing on this side looking at the contacts that are ascribed to zero lists. And as it's important right now, it is removed all of the contact records that were entered after October 20. So the only things that are sitting out here under those 1186 contacts that are not a part of a list are older records.

Unknown Speaker  36:10
There's nothing this sucks. Yeah,

Speaker 2  36:16
I would like access to look at the lists, so that I can look at the

Unknown Speaker  36:25
I have access to look at all lists,

Speaker 2  36:26
and just all customers in general, but I don't have the ability to filter and choose the true point ones if that's possible.

Speaker 1  36:34
Yeah. So I'll tell you just to see all the

Speaker 2  36:44
I think a list see all Yeah, possibly for that. Slowly giving me all any none.

Unknown Speaker  37:06
Subscription search.

Unknown Speaker  37:07
Oh, what about context? Yeah.

Speaker 1  37:13
Proof sync export, or you need to import permissions? Yep. We import experts in prove. The second

Speaker 2  37:24
thing. I'll log out and log back in in case it's needing

Speaker 1  37:30
to reset. Let me just see, I was curious in running the contact report again. And see what that segment.

Speaker 2  37:45
Yeah, the volume and just kind of going back to your comment about the sales purchase price volume. I think that's really interesting. And then tied in with your question on, you know, how many inbound inquiries are manageable for one person while you're working, active leads, while you're following up with people that have sold things and have questions. If we can maintain a pace, I mean, I personally have a goal that every sales person on the Online team at one point will be selling a building a day, like it'll be a consistent 365 sales is like you're selling and building a day.

Unknown Speaker  38:26
Whether it's as easy as possible. Yeah,

Speaker 2  38:31
I think so. I think it's possible. I think it's possible for the team to be collectively selling, you know, like five buildings a week between Tori and I, if the pipeline is, to your point, does a big enough basket to pull over? And so I think that is possible. And I think right now, I mean we just don't have any evidence to go back and look at it historically. Like we're building our trends for the first time and we are kind of ping pong in between the two of us closing like a deal every seems like four days.

Unknown Speaker  39:15
So just kind of

Speaker 2  39:16
growing that qualified lead base and tightening down those metrics. I mean, that's almost one it's almost two buildings a week.

Unknown Speaker  39:27
It's two and a half. Yeah.

Speaker 2  39:28
So I think it was five buildings a week. One a day isn't really

Matthias Miller  39:35
just to set your expectations. Yeah, they gave and Mike are going to be happy with if you guys are about half Okay, they're they're happy they would be happy at at a million and a quarter. That's kind of where they set standard expectations which which you and Tori with the ticket prices you're at you're you're basically

Unknown Speaker  39:57
together, you're there

Matthias Miller  40:00
So individually you're 50% There sure but what you're proposing is pretty close to a 3 million you know if we can keep this average ticket price up to 12k Then that's about a $3 million salesperson which is which is slightly under what Eric was doing what I tried to do

Speaker 2  40:21
based on Eric's trainings that's what it seemed to me like he was pacing it was he was closing a sale a day that seems to be his his expectations for a team like that

Matthias Miller  40:38
don't want to go down this rabbit hole now but I would like to talk some time about metrics

Unknown Speaker  40:45
and reporting but

Matthias Miller  40:48
I was thinking surely there's a way to Active Campaign you contacts in segment

Unknown Speaker  41:09
segment builder would have expected it to be able to I'm sure there's a way I guess it doesn't really matter

Unknown Speaker  41:39
no Okay,

Matthias Miller  41:43
so let's not get derailed with that either. Okay, so now we have 670 in there that's looking much better so in the campaign

Unknown Speaker  42:14
I can't remember email designer continue and I said the from scratch I said what I said not what I wanted can't explore settings at Google settings we're going to try to create another one go ahead and delete this one. Designer either this one or say hello to a new salesperson I'm pretty sure it's this And then we do email subjects is.

Speaker 2  45:54
Adding some questions to that sheet you showed for questions for Eric right and then some dialogue

Unknown Speaker  46:06
so this one doesn't have Okay, so here you go.

Matthias Miller  46:12
So if you wanted to put in

Unknown Speaker  46:16
say salesperson phone number you would just use the personalization tags find it and stick it in wherever it needs to be in the Contents Under next see should be going out on the 10th at 346?

Matthias Miller  47:39
I usually pick times that are like not literally, you know not exactly on the hour running 15 minute. Sure. And so then got that you hit Finish. And again, probably we'll need to make some edits to it. But there it is. And if you want to as well

Unknown Speaker  48:01
on the

Speaker 2  48:03
can email start to post images, or do they have like a banner to them? Or they're just an email.

Matthias Miller  48:11
They're just an email and it actually helps deliverability to Yeah, well, two things. It feels more personal. And it actually helps deliverability as well.

Unknown Speaker  48:23
That makes sense.

Unknown Speaker  48:27
Keeping it strictly to text.

Speaker 2  48:32
So just for my visual memory, can you go back? Yep, here and then the campaign creation, just the buttons really quick. I want to make sure I kind of visually see them one more time. So campaign here's the

Speaker 1  48:44
campaigns go in here. Yep, that's, that's no, I want to go back and edit it. Back to edit,

Matthias Miller  48:56
standard, got the campaign name. The list truepoint was 2020 to 12 promos. And the design had the template in there. And just very straightforward. I'll have any sign off from from gave here.

Unknown Speaker  49:19
Probably actually would be good to have something like Oh, sure. It's very simple. Sign off and then the summary

Matthias Miller  49:36
shows the subject. That's where you change the subject if you need to modify email coming from the list and see the list size. Automation. I don't know that there's really anything you need to change on that. But

Unknown Speaker  49:48
let's say shrunk. It's like half

Unknown Speaker  49:50
of the we had 600x

Matthias Miller  49:54
Yeah, we're excluding the November folks though. Oh, that's right. I'm sorry. Got it. Okay. And then date. Here's where you set the date and time. Yep. So we're doing Saturday afternoon, Monday morning, Monday afternoon

Speaker 1  50:13
for the first three. And you can also Oh, nevermind. You can do a preview, but I don't know if I can add let me see if I add this contact oops not my Okay, so let's

Matthias Miller  50:50
see if I add this contact if the first name. Uh huh. If you set up your, your own contact, and fill in the opportunity status and things like that, are really what you want to do is salesperson and phone number, then you can test the, when you do send test, you can test the or you click the desktop preview, which I can share here. Then you'll be able to see make sure that the substitution is worked correctly.

Unknown Speaker  51:19
Okay. Got it.

Speaker 2  51:28
And you over wrote the template from November's promo. And that's kind of the same cycle. Is that right?

Unknown Speaker  51:40
Yes. Okay.

Speaker 2  51:45
Does that impact metrics at all, but overriding it? Instead of creating a new one? Oh,

Unknown Speaker  51:51
no, I'm sorry. Oh, no,

Matthias Miller  51:54
this is actually a brand new campaign. Okay. Let's you're talking about the Google Doc. Yeah. No, like the Yeah.

Speaker 2  51:59
Okay. So in Google's doc, it was just kind of overriding it. But out here is this is more of a

Matthias Miller  52:05
read a copy. Or copy? Yeah. The original still? Yeah, okay. Yeah, no, like, no, we want no, we want separate. Yeah, we're creating a new campaign. Yes, six. Yeah, exactly.

Unknown Speaker  52:19
Okay, perfect. Interesting. I

Speaker 2  52:49
definitely absorbed a lot of that. So I, I would be comfortable walking with your instructions, because you were very, very detailed ones here. I think if I do have any questions, it'll probably be right. Before I would pull the trigger on setting up a campaign. If you want me to practice on the next one. I can try.

Matthias Miller  53:05
Yeah, you can do everything short of scheduling it. And as long as, as long as it's in the future, as long as your data is in the future. Yeah. Which it should be. And if you're comfortable with that, I don't have a problem with you. Yeah, with you turning the schedule on. I'm gonna have to have a call at the top of the hour,

Speaker 2  53:27
set it up and then have it viewable. So if you have, you know, five minutes to log in and look at it, you could give it a skim through the next round.

Matthias Miller  53:36
Yeah, sounds good. Okay, and then I will so and I would go to maybe just try out one more. We need to figure out on our end whether I guess Hey, if you have an opinion you can chime in here. I'm ghostwriting for Gabe, they want these stories to be fairly accurate. I'm probably more comfortable with taking creative liberties than they are. Yeah. So I don't know if you have opinions about me signing off on these emails and having them introducing my adding yet another name in the mix. I'm not super excited about it, but

Speaker 2  54:19
it could work so that you're no longer ghost writing and you're just writing like it's from you. Yeah, no, they they need to stick to be either gave or the salespeople that they're talking to.

Speaker 1  54:32
Would you guys be comfortable putting your your your name to these stories?

Speaker 2  54:37
I think eventually we should. I kind of liked the fact they gave us kind of our pseudonym and name in a way because it's just one guy's name out there. It's not confusing.

Unknown Speaker  54:52
It makes less sense.

Speaker 2  54:53
I would not put your name on them and then have people start asking for you know Matthias sent me this it's like, that's not the point.

Matthias Miller  55:04
Yeah, exactly. Who is this guy? The other good thing about Gabe is that it does give us a fun play with good cop bad cop. Because yes, I mean, it is true for you guys did push to add this additional promotion, but it really makes it. I mean, it allows allows us to position you guys as their advocates you guys are and you don't have that when you're just a salesperson.

Speaker 2  55:33
Totally and gave us on the website like I remember reading like gave schlub oxen name is under the About Us and truepoint. So it needs to come from him. He's the only identified bull character in their story. Yeah, so I think that needs to stay the same.

Matthias Miller  55:51
Well, I'll figure out how to make it true to true to him. I'll just consider it a marketing challenge.

Speaker 2  55:58
If he's upset that he's like, Well, I wouldn't say it that way. I'd be like, well, it's not really us saying it, you're a representation of the brand. Like and maybe, maybe that's something he wants us a little and anonymity. Like,

Unknown Speaker  56:15
you know, it's not a name.

Matthias Miller  56:17
I don't think it's anonymity. It's the it's, I think, ultimately, it's Amish culture. More than anything else, I mean, wild tales are, you know, funny, true stories are, are fantastic. Wild tales that are spun out of proportion, ya know, ya know, it's, it's kind of counters the definition of integrity. And, I don't know, I think if you understand at least a little bit of German culture, there's, there's at least some element of kind of stoic, rational piece that comes in as well. So I have a

Speaker 2  57:04
conversation frequently. He is German Belgian and it is straight to the point all the time and I am Italian and Irish and there's a lot of hand motions I totally get it. Um, yeah, let's lean into that. I mean, with those objections I would definitely support not putting your personal name on there but if they need this to be more of a character

Unknown Speaker  57:28
a

Speaker 2  57:30
it might be beneficial for it not to be anybody's name. And having like a blue a true point.

Unknown Speaker  57:42
A mascot Hi,

Speaker 2  57:43
I am Yes, you know, whatever that might be

Matthias Miller  57:49
the equivalent of interesting Bob the Builder for 2.0 My gosh, that's a horrible

Unknown Speaker  57:55
horrible idea. But

Matthias Miller  57:56
what some kind of mascot some kind of fictional? I don't know, though. Because that still flies in the part of people want to do business with people.

Speaker 2  58:06
They do. And I've thought about in his signature, if it says gave, I think it used to say like, gave Schlabach you know, owner I think it needs to identify like,

Matthias Miller  58:16
What the heck is gave? Yeah,

Speaker 2  58:19
you know, to a stranger they don't know, Dave is I think it needs a point back to him being you know, he's the hero of the About Us story. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  58:35
Oh sounds good.

Unknown Speaker  58:39
Thanks for training. I appreciate it.

Matthias Miller  58:42
Yeah, absolutely. Thanks for doing this. Totally.

Unknown Speaker  58:44
Take care. Bye. All right. Yeah.
