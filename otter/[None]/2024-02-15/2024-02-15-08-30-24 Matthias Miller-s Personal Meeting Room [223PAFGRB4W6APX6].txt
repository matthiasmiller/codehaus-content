Speaker 2  03:58
no change on that because I know we blocked out for that today. I wanted to see if we could just defer that for one week. And plan on a second day that

Unknown Speaker  04:55
Um Oh,

Speaker 4  05:02
That's the one that sales sales orders with I think that's something that you were working with Dwayne on

Matthias Miller  05:18
this is when you make a deposit for multiple sales orders to make sure that they all get included in the same deposit.

Speaker 4  05:27
So I I did one like everything worked but I forget what it was supposed to what it was supposed to catch if I do wrong

Matthias Miller  05:48
if you would select three of the four payments okay and try to posit that in all of them yes

Unknown Speaker  05:58
because I tried to select

Speaker 4  06:07
now forget it. Whatever I tried to do it did not stop me. It allowed me to go right on through

Speaker 2  06:21
I mean, I'd have I could create another deposit easily for you today and why

Unknown Speaker  06:26
don't we just do that? Okay.

Speaker 3  06:30
Sounds good. All right, we're closing automatically recurring invoices, which is great. Skipping Joel Matthias closing process for accounting impact

Speaker 5  06:44
Yeah, this is it's still in my court. I need to spec it out and see if I can do it. Okay,

Speaker 3  06:49
sounds good. Blackout time for go lifeplan

Matthias Miller  06:56
20 This is the same as marks earlier when they

Speaker 3  07:01
drew the VI is do not match accounting. Let's see

Unknown Speaker  07:10
no change.

Speaker 3  07:11
No change. Okay. Matthias the 1099 summary report.

Matthias Miller  07:17
Entry score to review is

Unknown Speaker  07:19
this the

Speaker 4  07:22
old 1099 situation that we had discussed

Matthias Miller  07:28
the whole Yeah the whole kit and caboodle.

Unknown Speaker  07:33
Matthias allow company specific signature adjustments?

Speaker 5  07:36
No still in my court. Okay. Drew

Speaker 3  07:39
Uncategorized Expense Report revision for bank and credit card transaction report.

Speaker 4  07:46
Um, we we were gonna make a few comments on that after after the update here, so

Unknown Speaker  07:59
talk about it

Speaker 4  08:03
I guess put a put it in class and score and then he can change it if we include not to.

Speaker 3  08:09
Okay, sounds good. Matthias validate that on the deposit record the miscellaneous items account is different from the main deposit account.

Matthias Miller  08:19
This should be done MCs should have done it and I think that's true squirt. If he wants to confirm okay, we also did the same thing for

Speaker 5  08:31
checks as well. Yeah, there's an incident for this somewhere there

Speaker 3  08:35
is okay. So that to me, we'll probably find it later on. Mark put together budget totals in an Excel spreadsheet for Matthias to import

Unknown Speaker  08:47
no change

Unknown Speaker  08:52
Matthias transactions by contact reports

Matthias Miller  08:56
do we have any more

Unknown Speaker  09:04
that one works for

Matthias Miller  09:08
and so is this just a matter of making this be a standard report?

Speaker 4  09:15
Um, yes, because I still had to go through the link. Yep. I will

Unknown Speaker  09:21
hand it off to Johnson perfect.

Unknown Speaker  09:25
Record for right

Unknown Speaker  09:32
through Add Account subtype groupings for balance sheets we're just checking to make sure that worked

Unknown Speaker  09:52
so

Unknown Speaker  09:57
this something that's been in the works for quite a while

Unknown Speaker  10:01
I think so

Unknown Speaker  10:04
you can see what this is related to

Speaker 3  10:13
the burden headings and balance sheets. And okay, here's all this this was all done and we just wanted to make sure that drew was happy with it. Is that where we're at with us?

Matthias Miller  10:28
I'm gonna assume so. Okay. Yeah, well

Speaker 4  10:31
we'll take a look I know we looked at the income statement, but we didn't look at the balance sheet did we? Okay, so so we had looked at

Unknown Speaker  10:39
it briefly. Yeah.

Speaker 3  10:43
Probably have an email from Joel but let me see if I have anything attached that will help here I have things from November apparently attached I guess. Let me know if you need any more information. I can chase it down. Yeah. Okay, great. Matthias accounting chart of accounts report conditionally include columns.

Matthias Miller  11:08
Yeah, that's done. Drew we were showing the chart of accounts we were showing the number of transactions in the last transaction date and it was making the Chart of Accounts really slow. And so we've turned that off by default but you can turn on transaction counts if you want to see that

Unknown Speaker  11:28
got it. Perfect.

Matthias Miller  11:32
I just closed out I reviewed it and yeah, sounds

Speaker 4  11:36
good. Most of what I need that for is not how many transactions but just whether there are some or not right

Speaker 3  11:47
yeah, okay. Next item the eye the builder cash transaction reports

Matthias Miller  11:54
it's a duplicate of something else up there

Unknown Speaker  12:04
cash and credit card

Unknown Speaker  12:05
Yeah

Unknown Speaker  12:09
one of those things of multiple people not naming the same thing

Unknown Speaker  12:16
so something What did you say mark? It had something to do with what

Speaker 2  12:23
we covered earlier the one we wanted to review later checking credit card okay,

Unknown Speaker  12:27
actually four

Unknown Speaker  12:33
Okay, see what I can do take care out there okay Matthias allow attaching statements to reconcile

Unknown Speaker  12:48
I believe it should be done should be Andrews courts review

Unknown Speaker  12:52
okay

Speaker 3  13:00
it's all okay, so we'll skip that one. Drew, we had a vendor and company mismatch issue that I taught via email is that been fixed?

Speaker 4  13:19
I don't know is that I mean you've done something to deal with that and you're saying is back on my board or metals?

Matthias Miller  13:29
I think what we said was I think I was looking at this I think I got royally confused reading through it.

Speaker 5  13:39
So I think we should talk through this to make sure I understand what the issue is. Yeah.

Speaker 3  13:48
Yep. That was it. Okay. Well, should I put it on your plate Matthias or should I put it on my plate

Matthias Miller  13:59
What did you guys want to do what have you have a running agenda list for Yeah, I got it. Awesome. Appreciate it.

Speaker 3  14:09
And Matthias create process for moving payments from one episode to another

Unknown Speaker  14:14
no change. Okay.

Speaker 3  14:19
Let's see. Drew handling historically reconciled transactions

Speaker 4  14:31
that is still waiting on me. I need a little bit of clarification on that one because we could hit that later too. Perfect.

Unknown Speaker  14:39
Okay.

Unknown Speaker  14:43
Good.

Speaker 3  14:46
Assists checks and deposits validate against using apparent financial accounts drew that was

Matthias Miller  14:54
this is the same one that we had earlier.

Speaker 3  14:57
Exactly what duplicate Yeah. Uh, Nick? Yeah.

Matthias Miller  15:01
Yep.

Speaker 3  15:02
Okay awesome okay, assists check record add notes memo

Speaker 4  15:17
so that the notes memo spot is there, but I cannot attach anything that doesn't take attachments and the same goes for weight that's for checks sprint deposits. Now this specifically checks Yeah. Yeah. Is

Speaker 3  15:45
it related though to the checks and deposits? Well, maybe not.

Unknown Speaker  15:52
Probably.

Speaker 4  15:55
Check checks is where I ran into it. I've been wanting to on deposits but we were trying to do the same thing in both so. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  16:08
So who does this go back to? Matthias them?

Unknown Speaker  16:11
Yeah. Okay. Okay.

Speaker 3  16:18
All right. Prepaid approval status, Matthias. So

Matthias Miller  16:23
that's been done. I don't know that.

Unknown Speaker  16:27
Anything further is required. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  16:32
And then printing issues in the income statement Drew?

Unknown Speaker  16:40
I'll have to look at that. Okay.

Speaker 3  16:42
All right. Sounds good. So we've got new or possibly some overlapping here. Okay, so it's just checks and deposits validate against duplicate main and RG accounts? Is this something we've already talked about? Or is this a new issue

Speaker 3  17:08
so I think Nick may have worked on this and may have created some incidents that I wasn't sure if we had already, you know, we had already talked about so these are new incidents at least. What

Matthias Miller  17:19
what is the 9458 What was the number on the previous one that Nick did? We just thought it was a that was a duplicate.

Unknown Speaker  17:39
Oh,

Matthias Miller  17:41
okay. Yeah, they're closely related. But that's, I think, technically this one is the duplicate of the other of that first one that we were talking about, okay. But it really doesn't matter

Matthias Miller  18:03
this could also probably be in Drew, do you want to circle back on this and make sure it's as expected should be live.

Unknown Speaker  18:12
What's it supposed to be doing?

Matthias Miller  18:14
Okay, so we are validating on on a check in your miscellaneous items. You cannot select the same account that right you can't just select Primary checking if you're paying a primary checking and then also you can't select a parent account so if you've got

Unknown Speaker  18:34
Oh

Unknown Speaker  18:36
yeah, yeah, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  18:40
Okay, great. Is this a February item?

Matthias Miller  18:54
Drew would I mean I don't what date do you want on it?

Unknown Speaker  19:01
Um I love today

Speaker 3  19:08
all right. But tomorrow on it, I'll put that to work.

Unknown Speaker  19:14
These things are things that have I don't just do them right away and then I forever are

Speaker 3  19:23
all right. Same thing. This is one of these from negatives, financial accounts at non RG attachments memo to reconcile child screen that is coded and ready for review.

Speaker 5  19:34
Yeah, this is let me just this would not take much here to make sure that we've got the attachment.

Matthias Miller  19:46
Okay. Let's see. Yeah, we are able to attach I mean, it should be that is we have something very similar about attaching reconciles previously, that would be in Drew's court to review.

Unknown Speaker  19:58
Okay, Well, should I close this one out? Then we say it's done.

Matthias Miller  20:05
If it's linked to the incident? Well, yeah, if it's linked to the incident then this I would prefer to keep this one.

Speaker 3  20:14
Okay, unless we have one that's not linked to an incident. Correct.

Unknown Speaker  20:18
Start okay. Yes.

Unknown Speaker  20:29
Okay. Sounds good.

Speaker 3  20:34
Po exports. I just had a note saying to fixed

Matthias Miller  20:42
the Yeah, this is the report link. I'm sure it was a drew who asked was this Brainer drew that asked for it?

Speaker 3  20:55
Or okay. Yeah. Hey,

Unknown Speaker  21:00
we should. But

Matthias Miller  21:06
let me just shoot him an email and let him know that it's fixed and we can close it out. Okay. Sounds good.

Speaker 1  21:12
Five shipping, it's ready to eat.

Matthias Miller  21:16
Which already did okay, good.

Speaker 3  21:18
Okay, perfect. Okay, cash and credit card transactions also?

Unknown Speaker  21:24
Integrated the two others. So, this one can be? Yeah, this one can be closed.

Speaker 3  21:35
A Transaction Search add a column for the GL accounts. Do you have any speed can be gained? That was an email from Drew, I believe.

Matthias Miller  21:43
I'll take a look at it. When drew What's the timeline on it?

Speaker 4  21:48
Um, I think maybe I had some time in February or first of March, I think. I think I had it on the email.

Speaker 3  21:57
Okay, I may or may not have thought that then. Let's see. Oh, is this the one that you just received? This

Speaker 1  22:09
one? Yeah. Cancel whitetail.

Unknown Speaker  22:14
This is a

Unknown Speaker  22:18
Okay, that was a different

Matthias Miller  22:22
multiple items in the same email. I was referring to the first part of this.

Speaker 3  22:26
Oh, I gotcha. The revision request.

Matthias Miller  22:30
Yeah. Yeah. My response was the revision request. Okay. And not to the new is not the new items. Gotcha. So this needs to be scheduled.

Unknown Speaker  22:41
Okay.

Unknown Speaker  22:45
I was still looking at end of February.

Unknown Speaker  22:49
It can be into March.

Unknown Speaker  22:53
That works. Okay, let's do that.

Unknown Speaker  22:56
Perfect.

Speaker 3  22:59
And then response on the checking and credit card spending report is something that we would have already discussed then.

Unknown Speaker  23:08
Yes, this one can be closed. Now. It's a duplicate of

Matthias Miller  23:13
the cash or checking or card or were builder report are?

Speaker 3  23:22
Well, as per usual, the terminology always gets me on these things. So I apologize. All right. And then create standard cash and credit card transactions.

Matthias Miller  23:35
This is apparently the main incident for 94. This is just close this out. This is Nick was adding this thing to the standard. Was standardizing a user report and so okay, just considered a subtask. That's done. Perfect.

Speaker 3  24:03
Okay, I think that's it for me. It sounds like you guys have a lot to talk about. And you'll probably shoot me some updates after the meeting, I assume. Okay, sounds great. Well, I will leave you to it then. Have a great meeting.

Unknown Speaker  24:18
All right. Bye. Thanks. Bye. Right

Matthias Miller  25:10
All right, well drew you get the list so

Unknown Speaker  25:12
Okay,

Matthias Miller  25:13
let's see. Yeah

Unknown Speaker  25:17
well on that thing that was often duplicated that check and credit card

Unknown Speaker  25:24
is

Speaker 4  25:28
we have the and it's probably due to the new logic but it lists like the name of the vendor name twice on a good number of these you know like airworks ABC fashion network CVC and I don't know is that I'm not sure how it's pulling the vendor name twice but I mean it was difficult change the logic it probably doesn't matter if it's there but

Unknown Speaker  26:11
he is good point I will take a look at that

Speaker 4  26:34
but otherwise everything looks great. You had the comment of going to the contact name for those transfers of Avetis find leave it that way because, I mean not all the past ones will but at least going forward they should have contact names for those transactions anyways.

Matthias Miller  26:58
I want to make sure that first one that I'm clear on on the on the first issue the first issue is on the duplicate transaction warning you're getting the contact name more than once right. was really talking about something else in the duplicate contact name.

Speaker 4  27:13
The checking credit card transaction report. I'm sorry.

Speaker 2  27:18
Yeah. Report you'd send out to me. Me and Julie last last night you'll see that like we're looking at an ABC copy

Unknown Speaker  27:32
Okay, let me get rid of ABC oh

Speaker 2  27:40
you'll see airworks app net real to

Unknown Speaker  27:48
me all right here let's do this screenshot All right, I won't even

Unknown Speaker  28:04
pretend to

Matthias Miller  28:06
figure out what that was thinking. Okay, so this is on the

Matthias Miller  28:19
Okay, got it. And then you said on the transfer names you're good with the same logic that we're using elsewhere just like is

Speaker 2  28:28
what's causing the the names are to repeat is this Wow, okay, that's I guess. Skip that question. It just like is it an easy fix to make?

Unknown Speaker  28:47
I'm going to

Matthias Miller  28:50
assume it's just something silly that I did but

Unknown Speaker  29:03
action line notes.

Unknown Speaker  29:06
Let me

Speaker 5  29:09
check something here. It's it's actually DS

Unknown Speaker  29:17
well

Matthias Miller  29:28
it's happening because we started putting the vendor name in the notes.

Unknown Speaker  29:39
Were

Matthias Miller  29:42
like for AP, AP transfers and things like that. And so there are situations in which the the notes duplicate the contact and so I mean, we can very simply just

Unknown Speaker  29:57
eliminate

Matthias Miller  29:59
Yeah, Then we just don't include that the second time if the notes match the contact

Unknown Speaker  30:07
also exact same do

Speaker 4  30:19
the vendor company and the company mismatch this comes from that AP report

Unknown Speaker  30:32
on the job balance diagnostic

Speaker 4  30:40
yes the account balance diagnostic there would be old and this is all old stuff

Unknown Speaker  30:52
below based see

Unknown Speaker  31:01
able

Speaker 4  31:09
like a fair number of these things that don't have a an in and out match have something wrong with the payment setup

Unknown Speaker  31:26
okay so

Unknown Speaker  31:30
let's move on

Unknown Speaker  31:38
so um

Speaker 4  31:45
Okay, yeah like right here would be one your vendor the one that's on the right pane the vendor is premier metals st and the bill to is affordable barn company. Right so this vendor says this is the vendor for shed time and so I think that's why it's hanging out here because it can't can't make a connection

Unknown Speaker  32:18
to the

Matthias Miller  32:22
so the vendor would have been

Speaker 4  32:27
the vendor was modified in the great name change and it didn't you know, it was just whatever that company was without the SD on the end premier metals and then it got turned into Premiere metals st or shed time. So the PIO did as well and then the invoice does but the company being billed always was ABC

Unknown Speaker  33:02
so well are you sure it's

Matthias Miller  33:08
with the should have been a

Unknown Speaker  33:12
check as well

Unknown Speaker  33:25
so TOS

Unknown Speaker  33:39
I wonder

Unknown Speaker  33:43
see if we would okay, this is check number 27

Matthias Miller  33:53
see this if this check would be broken out into i outs to the specific vendor invoice it was paying for then it would resolve this particular issue now it's not true for all of them but I think it's true for this one

Speaker 4  34:20
so the poll invoices are paid with the same check it's gonna think it doesn't have a match in that right

Matthias Miller  34:33
yeah, although I'm confused why I'm a little confused because I thought it was handling this

Unknown Speaker  34:46
vendor invoice

Unknown Speaker  34:53
Okay, let's do this.

Unknown Speaker  35:07
count transaction level so we need to actually be looking at this guy

Unknown Speaker  35:24
let's do

Speaker 5  35:37
it some and then let's just make this be your new line so that you can read it so I would expect this to

Unknown Speaker  35:57
I'm Gavin

Unknown Speaker  36:04
invoice

Matthias Miller  36:07
the one we're looking at would be for last two zeros or four

Unknown Speaker  36:16
was one of these up here

Speaker 5  36:24
1190 620-911-8629 So this one

Unknown Speaker  36:34
should have

Unknown Speaker  36:42
only showing up once

Unknown Speaker  36:51
Am I missing trans event scription

Unknown Speaker  36:58
level record ID

Unknown Speaker  37:02
mutual account

Unknown Speaker  37:14
well

Matthias Miller  37:44
right let me let me take a quick look at this I don't want to take up too much of your time here but if we would if we would go

Speaker 5  37:53
we're grouping these let's try this okay let's do let's do that too

Unknown Speaker  38:09
so we have I can actually make sense of this

Unknown Speaker  38:18
is the transaction data was after

Matthias Miller  38:21
so the transaction ID would be this guy

Unknown Speaker  38:27
on RBS? GFCI external info information on the wire Well, my insurance Yeah, right. Should I join the GFCI is my Nana checker

Matthias Miller  38:58
Okay, well, let me okay, here's the bottom line. So this is

Unknown Speaker  39:03
GFCI. So

Matthias Miller  39:08
let me

Matthias Miller  39:18
let me at least start by chasing this particular issue because that's at least one of the reasons why things aren't getting matched up. Okay, I don't I don't know that it's the only reason but it's at least one of them. And then maybe if we can get that cleared out, we can take a closer look at it looks to me like maybe checks are being included. Well, I don't know. I'll just have to go take a look.

Speaker 5  39:46
So the AAP II, like account balance diagnostic. VI's paid by cheque or not balancing

Unknown Speaker  39:59
Okay. But she said

Speaker 4  40:02
Now there's another thing with this another group where the payment information is not filled in. I noticed that mostly I forget which company it was I think maybe shed time were there were there were just oodles of noodles back in you know the early months June July August I think it was shut down because a lot of the stuff Landon Yeah, I think it's that so like all of those up at the beginning are wait

Unknown Speaker  40:46
like some of those

Speaker 4  40:51
so this one, yeah, it's just that but nation so I mean, one thought that I had would be quick fix for this instead of going through and just entering all that information, if we could just have all of these grouped. Like you know, basically if I could just come up with a total for all the ones that are like that and and then just make a journal entry and forget about them.

Unknown Speaker  41:28
So this would be

Speaker 4  41:30
some fast fix to turn all those into just pay by cheque and you know, pay by cheque and on throw in a date and everything just to make them go away. If you know there's some fast option like that, but I mean, we

Matthias Miller  41:50
we could fairly easily

Unknown Speaker  41:58
be in VI accounting impacts so we're using the payment date

Matthias Miller  42:12
I think it's the payment date. Yeah. So it would be something like

Matthias Miller  42:24
where you got a vendor invoice?

Speaker 5  42:29
Where we ice status, the invoice status is paid. And then and not isn't Avi accounting comm what do we use for the accounting company? The invoice accounting company?

Unknown Speaker  43:07
Why would they have a?

Unknown Speaker  43:13
P? No.

Unknown Speaker  43:22
What would it be the cleaning companies?

Matthias Miller  43:45
We could, I don't know. We don't have to get into it now. But basically we will be looking for is who is everybody who's been paid without a payment date that falls after the whatever the the corresponding effective date. And we could then assign that to primary checking for that.

Unknown Speaker  44:23
I mean,

Matthias Miller  44:26
in some ways, it's messy historical data, but it's okay. Would allow this report to zero out then.

Unknown Speaker  44:37
Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 4  44:43
I mean, it's one of those things where I don't spend a ton of time on it because it's a one time thing way back when you know, we're never going to go back to 23 to try to make sense out of numbers. So but if we don't have to worry about Do you know that while they're stuck back there, there's not going to balance out? You know? It's helpful. So,

Unknown Speaker  45:06
okay.

Matthias Miller  45:08
All right. Well, we'll see if there's a quick fix. We're getting sucked down. Or

Speaker 4  45:15
I wouldn't do right. I would say, while you're doing it, like makes that it would also catch if there were payment date, but no payment account or something like that. Like there's some of those too.

Unknown Speaker  45:47
Okay

Speaker 4  45:53
on the historical reconcile connection there

Speaker 4  46:03
the way I understood your question was about saying which reconciled transactions go into is that correct? Because I was thinking it would pull from like it would stamp each transaction or whatever with the one that I reconcile it with.

Matthias Miller  46:25
Yeah, so I mean, the main thing that we're needing is they're already stamped tied to the right reconcile. Okay, at the main, the main thing that we're needing is we've got historical transactions. And we just need to make sure that

Unknown Speaker  46:42
oh, here,

Unknown Speaker  46:44
me.

Unknown Speaker  46:56
transaction dates, support. Like let's see, we're in shed time.

Unknown Speaker  47:11
We're where am I?

Matthias Miller  47:14
Let's do it. Let's do okay, ABC primary. ABC primary cap one.

Speaker 5  47:19
So ABC primary? Well, let's do primary checking.

Matthias Miller  47:29
So here we have, we have transactions that were entered with an end date of 110 110 31. And 1130. So what we need is rows in here, where the Oh, what is it like? 11? Is it 12?

Speaker 4  47:51
That'd be like 11. One to 1131.

Matthias Miller  47:57
Yeah, or like, yeah. So be sorry, what would it be like this one should be a nine 120 320

Speaker 5  48:07
You might actually

Matthias Miller  48:19
that's a little weird. But then just get these tend to and then and get those entered with whatever balances that you want. And then once these rows are in here, then we can

Unknown Speaker  48:34
then we can link

Matthias Miller  48:37
Yeah, take the temporary field that we had Lincoln Lincoln correctly to the reconciliation and then get rid of that temporary Date field that we've added.

Unknown Speaker  48:43
Yeah, okay.

Speaker 4  49:03
All right, then switching gears to taking care of some vendor payment issues. Um, so with that shed time, check duplication situation. I have a couple of vendors that deposited that check, and now sits as a credit for us. So I like credits that the vendor gives and they say, oh, there was damaged product and so we'll give you a credit for it. There we can just create a a negative vendor invoice and then use that at some point. Whereas here I still need to hit the checking account. But I want it to sit on a p as a credit so Will it work? Or should it work? If I assign by create a check? Put it in the AP GL account. And the check is to that vendor. Like, ideally that would would be the mode that I would do use. But how am I going to make so that comes up as a credit for that vendor when I go to pay that vendors bills? Or do we need to use something totally different?

Matthias Miller  50:40
I'm sorry, let me run. Okay, the scenario is

Unknown Speaker  50:46
that

Speaker 4  50:53
we wrote a check that now sits as a vendor credit, right

Matthias Miller  51:07
and you want to be able to use it on a future vendor invoice so you need it to show up as ideally as an unpaid vendor invoice, but you want it sitting in AP?

Unknown Speaker  51:30
Well

Speaker 4  51:39
like, I wonder if this ties into the whole vendor credits situation, you know, that. Like that we really shouldn't have something where you pull up the vendor, and it says, Oh, here's the vendors account balance, we have some credits here. And then it's just a another, maybe a little checkbox that pulls up a dialog, you know, when you're going to pay like maybe there's an icon that says this, When I'm going to pay this vendor has some credits, pulls up a little dialog box you select the credits to use and move on that way and it would be based on some other platform or rather than just basing all that as negative invoice

Matthias Miller  52:39
I think what you're proposing makes sense

Unknown Speaker  52:50
the

Unknown Speaker  52:58
Okay.

Matthias Miller  53:01
Short term fix to get you going in the long term fix short term fix to get you going. Could you just create a an unpaid vendor invoice with the credit amount manually? And then create a check for out of AP? Except it's going to hang around there forever, isn't it? Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  53:25
Well

Speaker 4  53:35
Could I make a well, good, I make a vendor invoice for $0 and write out a check for it. Change my check payment amount, the amount of the credit leave it as unpaid

Unknown Speaker  54:00
No, no, that wouldn't work.

Speaker 4  54:12
And then, well, okay, so with this, then there's problem number two. And that is when we go to pay a vendor invoice. We can we can adjust the payment amount to whatever we want to actually pay. But I don't have a way of making a second payment, then. Yeah. So that kind of makes that I can't, I can't do this negative payment thing and then use it later.

Matthias Miller  55:25
Okay, longterm. Yes, we need to handle credits. I think it's I don't know who that conversation needs to be with. That's a Josh question. I kind of suspect well I would say Josh should be the first person to talk to you about that

Unknown Speaker  55:43
so if you would

Matthias Miller  56:05
well, okay, here's an idea. I don't know if this would work or not, is the Euro dollar invoice invoice total $0 payment amount is whatever the credit amount is. When you write a check to that vendor invoice and market paid and then you create a second vendor invoice with a negative of Invoice Amount unpaid have the same amount

Matthias Miller  56:37
I'm not sure if it's gonna hit accounting correctly or not

Speaker 4  56:46
that was like the second invoice would be a negative invoice.

Matthias Miller  56:51
Yeah, to get your credit, negative unpaid invoice to get your credit Let me try I wonder if

Speaker 4  57:02
it's gonna complain that the payment amount and the balance won't I mean the invoice amount won't match on the first one but that won't stop me well

Matthias Miller  57:15
I think you should still be able to bypass it it's kind of like a

Speaker 4  57:22
one of a warning unless you know better type of thing.

Unknown Speaker  57:27
Yeah

Matthias Miller  57:33
let's see. Alright, so let's do this. Let's do a new vendor invoice and let's go pick pick somebody

Unknown Speaker  57:47
so let's see

Unknown Speaker  57:49
the just pull up one

Speaker 5  58:08
in this which company is here let's do this let's Lanford note

Unknown Speaker  58:19
that we had

Unknown Speaker  58:25
so I just got an email from illness oh here

Matthias Miller  58:33
Alright, so we're just gonna do total $0 the payment amount is 24567 paid out payment date is today. payment account would be out of the

Unknown Speaker  58:53
check primary checking

Matthias Miller  58:56
does not match missing an address ignored and save Alright, so then we go to

Unknown Speaker  59:08
meeting payment and we create one for why is this one out status that's approved still

Unknown Speaker  59:29
we pay by cheque

Unknown Speaker  59:42
and we change the payment amount

Unknown Speaker  59:52
all right. So then let's do

Unknown Speaker  1:00:00
Let's check accounting and accounting so this is this would

Matthias Miller  1:00:22
acting AP okay let's see what this one has

Unknown Speaker  1:00:33
so this does not have any impact on

Matthias Miller  1:00:47
see this your your credit is going to hang out forever as an unlinked

Unknown Speaker  1:00:59
well in a way that's what it is

Matthias Miller  1:01:05
once you use it then you want it to be disciplined I mean you want it to disappear

Speaker 4  1:01:11
right well would the credit invoice like because that's just us and make make the next bit checks smaller

Speaker 4  1:01:33
whereas the check that the additional check that I wrote out and created the credit is not linked to anything it is just playing a an accident we'll check the console

Unknown Speaker  1:01:51
sure

Matthias Miller  1:02:00
okay so so why not just straight up write a check out to accounts payable and then create a negative unpaid vendor invoice and then just link them just put in the notes just link and back and forth so you know what happened and it's going to be in your account balance diagnostic

Unknown Speaker  1:02:26
forever

Unknown Speaker  1:02:33
and if you

Speaker 4  1:02:39
if, if I would use this what we just did, creating the zero

Unknown Speaker  1:02:47
invoice

Speaker 4  1:02:50
and paying that that really doesn't gain us anything more does it? No,

Matthias Miller  1:02:55
because because the vendor invoice doesn't have anything can't do anything to accounting

Unknown Speaker  1:03:03
Right? Right.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:05
It's basically just one more record that

Unknown Speaker  1:03:09
Yeah, that's true.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:12
Yeah

Unknown Speaker  1:03:15
well, that would work for the time being

Matthias Miller  1:03:24
the other option would be do you have an invoice from this vendor yet?

Unknown Speaker  1:03:33
Like other invoices

Matthias Miller  1:03:37
any unpaid invoices from them yet?

Speaker 4  1:03:40
Um, I suppose we do. Let me

Unknown Speaker  1:03:50
checks.

Speaker 4  1:03:54
So Indiana, Michigan power is going to be one of them.

Speaker 4  1:04:28
Another one would be cuts K u tz air tools

Unknown Speaker  1:04:36
potstickers

Unknown Speaker  1:04:38
Oh, this hurts. Okay.

Speaker 6  1:04:42
No, m c and p oil there we go. So could you

Speaker 4  1:05:04
This would work really nicely if if the amount was more than the credit the credit here is $2,138

Unknown Speaker  1:05:14
Yeah

Speaker 4  1:05:16
but if we put this in if we put it in here then we'd be sitting as you know what 915 is 1700 bucks but it would be a legit credit damn thing is I would probably need to contact them and say hey we are intending to use up those credits on this right

Matthias Miller  1:05:52
yeah, I was thinking that was where my mind was going but

Matthias Miller  1:06:03
now okay other really I don't think you can do this yeah I think we're back to

Matthias Miller  1:06:17
I just think the most straightforward solution is is writing a cheque assigning those manually green checks to AP for those accounts amounts

Speaker 4  1:06:31
notice tape them as connected to these invoices is that is what we will do then

Matthias Miller  1:06:44
to really bring that up with Josh on the on the Wednesday call as far as

Speaker 4  1:06:49
the credit Yeah, now is there what about the second payment on an invoice type of situation? Is that something major? Like I'm thinking it should be like if this is different let's take this one right here this $455 foreign dollar for five cents so if we made a payment for $300 If that is different Well it wouldn't have to be conditional even but just some way of creating yet another check record or payment record within this

Matthias Miller  1:07:38
Yeah, talk to Josh about how to handle that. I think I would start with him again. I got off the cuff I don't think it's just ridiculously easy but

Unknown Speaker  1:07:54
yeah

Unknown Speaker  1:08:07
okay.

Speaker 4  1:08:41
And then on the duplicate checks, Mark was wanting kind of another clarification on how we are assuring that that doesn't happen more. I know you've explained it already. But builders are kind of concerned and you can answer their question a lot better than we can. How we can you know, what the mode is makes it that they because you said you have a way of stopping it.

Matthias Miller  1:09:13
So So basically when you go to print checks

Unknown Speaker  1:09:22
we will not

Speaker 5  1:09:30
okay, let's say that you you were in the test system so we can do this.

Matthias Miller  1:09:36
I'm gonna open two windows here. And I'm gonna say I'm gonna go to both of them. I'm gonna say I want to print both of them. And I hit yes to this one. And continue to this one.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:49
Actually, hang on. I found that we pull in my own. Well, that's not good.

Matthias Miller  1:09:58
I thought it would pull in my own My own reasoning we had to move that check one layer deeper

Matthias Miller  1:10:08
if you were to

Matthias Miller  1:10:19
remind reminds me of the awkward Oh, I forget the exact situation the awkward Steve Jobs Apple lunch demo where he was trying to demo something and it completely didn't work. Okay, so now, I haven't opened in both sides if I if I go through the whole process. So, here here it assigns a check number and then here I try to assign it to 2185 then it just doesn't let me do anything if I come back and refresh them to check is gone. Now, there is a minor loophole that we probably should fix here, which is if you open the print check screen at the same time and then one person runs it first and then the other person runs it we still have a slight chance of doing that I mean happening which I could

Speaker 4  1:11:21
and and this would be the same thing as a person pulling up some sort of old cash like if you went through in one day ran it and then the next day because of how you get there or whatever it pulls an old cache and you hit print again it would say oh this just like somebody else printing right and it will keep them from doing it. Now Now what if the what is the check number is gone. Like if the check later really got deleted for something the check record literally got deleted it would just go to unprinted. Again I mean it wouldn't go on printed if it goes unpaid right.

Matthias Miller  1:12:16
It would go back to unpaid yeah but if you got somebody deleting checks and putting the check numbers for checks that are out there in circulation right you need to have a sit down conversation with them about that but

Speaker 4  1:12:39
we haven't necessarily ruled out that we didn't have that the system did not just go delete a bunch of checks. I mean are is that practically impossible?

Matthias Miller  1:12:50
Delete the check or delete the doing the check number

Unknown Speaker  1:12:58
well I suppose either way,

Speaker 2  1:13:00
let's go take a look. First batch that disappeared

Speaker 4  1:13:03
right right like that first batch that disappeared. What I'm not sure is why did they why did they come up again to be printed? Or did we just they were already printed and we accidentally selected them and hit print and it just threw new numbers

Matthias Miller  1:13:39
so well we can figure out your all the deletions I don't remember the specific dates around this scenario

Unknown Speaker  1:13:52
Yeah, all those Tuesday ones I don't know why they're dated for Tuesday. What day is today? Oh

Unknown Speaker  1:14:04
yeah, I sent you that was

Unknown Speaker  1:14:07
Yeah, but I just did it this morning

Unknown Speaker  1:14:14
we deleted them this morning

Unknown Speaker  1:14:19
w e h suppliers not even one

Unknown Speaker  1:14:26
ABC.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:29
Now this was it was all

Unknown Speaker  1:14:33
right. I'm just sure I'm sure why is this

Speaker 4  1:14:49
Oh, I know what this is. Yes, I know what this is. Um, there was a I had a whole ton so I acted and then I they were it was in the process of getting them done. And then I was like oh the ones not right so I cancelled this process and when I ended up I had all the checks in the text print ready to go and all the vendor invoices still available to pay

Unknown Speaker  1:15:29
so I had

Speaker 4  1:15:31
I had to get rid of them somehow or another so what I did is I just deleted the checks and then re selected them properly and created them again. I tried refreshing I thought well, maybe it just doesn't connect but it was I mean the the checks were as legitimate as they come in the bills to pay were still a little bit late

Unknown Speaker  1:15:59
so

Unknown Speaker  1:16:06
that's what all those are.

Speaker 2  1:16:08
So the one thing at least this morning aren't showing somewhere else.

Speaker 4  1:16:13
Are we? Well, okay, I really did not delete any I just changed numbers. But this is only delete. Yeah, that wouldn't be on here

Unknown Speaker  1:16:27
Yeah, none of these are on here.

Unknown Speaker  1:16:31
But what about the ones have the 117

Speaker 4  1:16:36
Well, I mean, it could be it could be that but there would be way more of them you know, there should be there should be 20. And it did the same thing to everything. So that's some legitimate deleted chat. Probably what it is something went wrong. And so we just got rid of it that way. So this would be saying they were not deleted. So somehow they were just reprinted

Matthias Miller  1:17:15
they were Yeah, let me let me find this specific and I could not figure out how they got reprinted let me let me pull up the

Unknown Speaker  1:17:24
see duplicate check

Unknown Speaker  1:17:33
through

Matthias Miller  1:17:42
you don't have one of those tomorrow with the subject

Unknown Speaker  1:17:51
missing shit

Unknown Speaker  1:18:03
okay, there we go

Matthias Miller  1:18:09
found or not in the record

Speaker 5  1:18:21
looking at checks 1009 Check search checks.

Speaker 4  1:18:54
So, I went through and I changed all the check numbers back to the originals on these because like we know that that check. The check number that I changed it to was actually the check number and the check that paid the

Matthias Miller  1:19:09
invoice. This is the thing that has me baffled so we set the check number here, which looks like the first time we printed it was on the fourth 4pm. And then on the 17th You didn't the check didn't get blanked out. They got reset to the new number. And I mean it's extremely unusual that 13 days later, you could pull something from the cache and rerun it but at the same time, we can't figure out any any way that this could possibly have happened.

Speaker 4  1:19:47
Because you can't you can't mass print checks with numbers can you

Matthias Miller  1:19:52
know the only way this could have happened would have been if well and to and from the history, it looks like you were using the checks to print to assign check numbers, this wasn't manually assigned. And the only way for this to happen would have been this check with a check number would have had to be had to have been in the unprinted checks report. Which it should never be there. Which means it's it apparently would have been

Unknown Speaker  1:20:26
check checks to print. Well, let's, let's see this. I mean,

Matthias Miller  1:20:33
like, the only way it should be there is with a blank cheque number, which means it it would have somehow I don't know how the only way I can, I can figure out remotely how it would have happened is if somehow it was an old cash version from more than two weeks prior, or from about two weeks prior. And we would have allowed you to rerun it and assign the new check number, but there is no good plausible explanation that I've got as far as trial.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:06
So let's let me

Matthias Miller  1:21:12
further bullet proof this. So that we eliminate that one strange situation where even in a fluke situation it could potentially happen. And then it's just like, well, you can't when you mass print checks, we will never reprint checks that already have a check number doesn't matter. They're

Unknown Speaker  1:21:31
just just don't.

Matthias Miller  1:21:37
So then the only way that it would happen is if somebody intentionally deletes a checker planks, either check.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:45
Or check number

Speaker 2  1:21:48
that you're saying currently, if two people would open checks to print at the same time they could today, they could. Like, what, within five seconds of each other?

Matthias Miller  1:22:04
Yeah, if they would not just checks to print, but if they would hit both hit print selected checks. Or if if person is the first person hits, print selected checks, and somebody else opens print selected checks before the first person confirms.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:21
Oh,

Unknown Speaker  1:22:24
well, a second.

Matthias Miller  1:22:28
Got a very narrow window. But

Unknown Speaker  1:22:32
that was a possibility. When you have two people that are so excited to do the same job.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:41
You're the only one doing this right now.

Speaker 4  1:22:42
Yeah, well, I mean, I'm not obviously not done. Right. It's done out there. Oh, well, there's still only one person doing it. Like, I mean, yeah. So so. Basically, to be more sure than what we are now, we basically have to say that there's no way that the system can malfunction. I mean, like, we can have the same sort of mesh, there's a possibility of the same sort of malfunction in any other aspect. Some weird, Matt messes something up. I mean, we can't necessarily guarantee that there never will be anything that messes something up.

Speaker 2  1:23:33
I mean, should we? Do you feel like we're overboard to even take this any further? Like it's

Unknown Speaker  1:23:43
the bullet proven further?

Speaker 4  1:23:44
Well, what can be done to bulletproof it further? I mean, so we've covered that it was not a delay to Jack and if it would have been deleted. If it would have if it would have been deleted it could have worked the way we're supposing but we know that that's not what it was

Speaker 4  1:24:12
you cannot reprint checks that already have numbers. You cannot get to checks and do the reprint that do not have numbers unless you're within that one second timeframe.

Matthias Miller  1:24:28
Well previously you could have done it if previously if you would have your let's go find this guy again.

Unknown Speaker  1:24:39
Check search

Matthias Miller  1:24:47
previously, who if you had pulled up like this, you can pull this up or and then somebody else pulled this up and then you went to print and hit next or whatever. Even if you printed then they could still as long as it's open, they could come back and reprint assigning check numbers. So the window went from, you know? Okay, who knows what happens and somebody gets distracted, but typically 30 seconds or 15 seconds maybe. Now, where it had been, I mean, it could have been somebody could have had it open for a day and came back and say, Okay, let's print. Right.

Unknown Speaker  1:25:36
Something else we could do, I think about this

Matthias Miller  1:26:02
I wonder if we could also

Matthias Miller  1:26:09
Yeah, I mean, it's a very similar way of doing it.

Speaker 2  1:26:18
Well, so we're seeing what we have now is, you can only print after you've printed checks. At any given check one time, the only way to reprint it. The same, the only way to reprint. The state for the example is turning 40 Back off sick devensian Check here. The way it is currently, the only way you can reprint that is if you go just leave the check number on the original and reprinted.

Matthias Miller  1:26:52
Yeah, I mean, there's still this odd chance there's a there's a you know, depending how long somebody leaves leaves that prompt up on their screen, there is a potential window of time when it can get reprinted accidentally,

Unknown Speaker  1:27:03
like

Speaker 2  1:27:04
30 seconds or whatever from right. I mean, are you comfortable with just leaving it as is pure? Yes.

Speaker 4  1:27:17
Yeah, I mean, I think like, Matthias, you would be saying that an old cache being stored somehow or another is pretty much the only explanation for how that

Speaker 6  1:27:36
Well, I don't even know how that. I mean, I'm at a loss. Like, okay, if you

Matthias Miller  1:27:43
I can't see a scenario in which anybody, whether it's your browser, whether it's a filter, whether it's some other caching mechanism, I don't see any any way legitimately that you should have gotten that old of a cache but I also can't see if it wasn't cached. Anyway that these reports actually are these records actually showed up in the report and I also don't see any way we're where if you

Speaker 5  1:28:22
your selected values just check system ID were

Unknown Speaker  1:28:34
all here let's do this print checks template

Matthias Miller  1:28:39
I mean, if you take it the whole way down, I really am at a bit of a

Unknown Speaker  1:28:50
check print.

Unknown Speaker  1:28:54
Let's see what are we doing here? This is the print checks are 20.

Unknown Speaker  1:29:04
Where

Unknown Speaker  1:29:10
are you?

Unknown Speaker  1:29:40
game

Unknown Speaker  1:29:52
which blank value would should not be included anyway,

Speaker 1  1:30:01
that copy of the receipt. And

Matthias Miller  1:30:10
I mean, yeah, it just the likelihood everything from the platform level should be quite robust. And I'm not.

Unknown Speaker  1:30:23
I can't

Matthias Miller  1:30:33
it is the weakest link in the entire argument, which is why I point my finger there. But it still doesn't mean I have a plausible explanation for how

Speaker 2  1:30:45
there's no way that the invoice vendor invoice it's got the status got changed on those and they just circle around? Well, no, then you'd have you'd end up you'd have ended up with two different two sets of checks the system?

Speaker 4  1:30:59
Well, yeah, and it would have, and there would have been a payment record on that. already. Yeah. I mean, from what I'm seeing and hearing

Speaker 2  1:31:12
I'm comfortable with the safeguards are the what we put in place, but if you think we should take it they're not sure what you were referencing, or how you would make it more bulletproof Mathias, it sounded like you had a plan to eliminate that 32nd window to users opening eight at

Matthias Miller  1:31:35
the same time. Yeah, basically, basically what would happen is, if they do run it at the same time, then we would just exclude any checks in the printout that have already been printed. And it's at the very, very tail end of the process, and everything happens in one kind of atomic time period. So there is no potential for Person A beating Person B and the scenario it's yeah.

Speaker 2  1:32:05
Great. Do you believe we should do that baked yet or that step?

Speaker 6  1:32:17
Well, I think the primary reason to do it is

Matthias Miller  1:32:23
honestly as much to build trust and assurances with builders than anything else. I mean, is it a better is a superior more robust solution should probably have considered that from the beginning yes

Speaker 2  1:32:43
during that final thing would would pretty much plug all the holes that we can think of.

Matthias Miller  1:32:52
And yeah, we can then definitively go back to them and say, we're not sure how in the world this thing ever came to be and we can't find any explanation. But for this specific situation, we found a way to make sure that it is it is impossible for it that that if this situation happens again that these checks won't get reprinted.

Speaker 2  1:33:15
Well, if that's you know, a moderate I mean it's not not a huge project to fix that is no it's not well let's just do that. No, it's not I'm making it probably making it sound like it's much more it's not a huge issue it's just one of those small things that I do ideally we eliminate all chance of it ever happening again. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:33:42
I mean good

Unknown Speaker  1:33:53
what else

Unknown Speaker  1:33:54
this weird huh?

Speaker 4  1:33:58
That is everything that I have there isn't anything you're waiting on the back yet is there from us

Matthias Miller  1:34:09
the duplicate logic we talk about that

Unknown Speaker  1:34:12
Oh yes yes

Speaker 2  1:34:17
up all but are we doing a call it a check in at three today are not displayed by your

Unknown Speaker  1:34:24
see up to you guys. Right now I

Unknown Speaker  1:34:30
don't do we have anything for them?

Speaker 4  1:34:32
I don't think we will. I mean, I got a number of things to check into. And say let's just play it by ear but probably not. So no news from

Speaker 2  1:34:43
either Matthias or US canceling if we want to do it again. Good. Thanks for that. Yep. Thanks, Mark.

Speaker 5  1:34:55
All right. Let me see if I can find this. Coming to you

Unknown Speaker  1:35:13
alright, so

Matthias Miller  1:35:16
I want to make sure part of the issue I have, you know, some part of the change happened after we made made some changes to the other some of this other logic, so basically the way it's working now, which is my proposed solution is that when you enter a vendor invoice with a vendor invoice ID, you check vendor invoices for duplicate vendor plus IDs, regardless of date, amount or account. So it means that if somebody enters a vendor invoice with an ID, and then somebody enters the same one and Miss type CID or doesn't put the ID on it, you won't catch that scenario. Right. Then if it does not have an ID, or when you're entering a transaction, check plus or minus two days within plus or minus two days of the vendor invoice payment date. If the payment date is specified other ways search based off the invoice date for vendor invoices that share the same vendor amount and account. So if a vendor invoices and pay has no payment date, invoice in the First we'll look around the first plus or minus two days for duplicates, the moment it gets paid on the 15th will look plus or minus two days for duplicates at that point. And and then it's the same it's the same when if you have an unpaid invoice comparing to a paid invoice, go compare the invoice date versus the payment date. But if you're comparing an unpaid invoice to an unpaid invoice, you'll be comparing the invoice dates or the date ranges and then finally, and this was a situation you ran into when entering any vendor, invoice or transaction always look for transactions and then here's a few changes that did not come from the accounting impact ie they're not automatically created and that are plus or minus two days and share the same vendor account and amount now so a few changes first, we were not looking for duplicate transactions when you put in a vendor invoice you're doing that from the transaction but not from the vendor invoice and that that happened after the recent vendor invoice Id change. But the other thing that I'm not completely sure about is should we look at line items

Unknown Speaker  1:37:57
should we look at

Matthias Miller  1:38:03
at unlink transactions as well as miscellaneous items on checks for duplicates, or do we not care about misaligned ligneous items on checks?

Speaker 4  1:38:28
Yes, so let's suppose it is an E transfer I don't know somebody's set up to automatically withdraw money. You know, that's, let's say Amazon and your bank accounts attached. And then that comes through and somebody says oh, here's an E check. Let's write this as an E check. It would go into the miscellaneous line items. Yeah, we should be checking on those. Okay.

Matthias Miller  1:39:03
I think I think the easiest way to handle check duplications is to

Unknown Speaker  1:39:12
sorry, is to always

Matthias Miller  1:39:17
Yeah, rather than looking through the transaction just look at unlinked transactions, manually created transactions and then separately look for or check

Unknown Speaker  1:39:25
miscellaneous items

Speaker 4  1:39:31
now with this, would this also be miscellaneous items on credit card? How are we going to make we don't we can't make credit card transactions manually without spending an invoice. Yeah, so there we would have written the transaction as a journal entry to style of transaction Yeah, We should be good with us. We checked, check miscellaneous items. Yeah. All right now, is this transactions that is not? Is that transaction totals or is this line item?

Matthias Miller  1:40:17
Well, I think you have to look at line items on the on the

Unknown Speaker  1:40:24
check

Matthias Miller  1:40:26
it vendor invoice total or payment total? Oh, that's the other thing. We're using payment total if payment total is specified otherwise,

Unknown Speaker  1:40:36
invoice total? But

Matthias Miller  1:40:41
most likely? Well, I guess it's up to you. How do you want to have it work?

Speaker 4  1:40:49
Well, I think the main thing is, we just need to know how it works. See what I'm thinking is. So there's, there's 10 Different missing transactions in a credit growth statement. If it's going to look by line items, then I can create one transaction. And I can just enter all of those in one transaction, and I can put the contacts for the line item in, you know, faster that way. Whereas if I need to create a transaction close open another new transaction, you know, if I need to, if it's only going to look at transaction totals, then I need to do it that way to make sure that

Matthias Miller  1:41:40
so on the transaction record, we only look at transaction totals. Because we're matching on payment account. So we're looking at which as a side note, what we probably want to take a look at is actually checks that only have miscellaneous items on them and look at the check

Unknown Speaker  1:41:59
total for that.

Unknown Speaker  1:42:06
Yes, yes.

Matthias Miller  1:42:11
And my argument for not rolling them all into one is well, it's a better reflection of reality anyway.

Unknown Speaker  1:42:17
You

Matthias Miller  1:42:20
know, they're separate bank transactions.

Speaker 4  1:42:29
Well, and now that we have that multiple transaction, quick entry page, you know, that's probably the way we're going to be doing it. It's, and we're probably far enough away from whatever was quickly done in January that we don't have to worry too much about it. I mean, more, we'll just have to catch up and reconcile if that happened, right. Yeah, look at transaction totals and we got that tool to use to speed that up. All right.

Matthias Miller  1:43:07
Good. Anything else on your end that?

Unknown Speaker  1:43:13
I like so.

Unknown Speaker  1:43:16
Okay, sounds good. Appreciate it. All right. Yep. Thank you.
