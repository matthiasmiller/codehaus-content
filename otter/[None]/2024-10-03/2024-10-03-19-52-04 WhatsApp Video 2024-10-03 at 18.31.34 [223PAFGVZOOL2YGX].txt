Hey, y'all, the living room is celebrating one year, and we would absolutely love to have you there. So come out on October 8, at 6pm we're going to have an awesome night of good food, good conversation, worship and just a time of celebrating what God has done, and we would absolutely love to see you there. See you. There you.
