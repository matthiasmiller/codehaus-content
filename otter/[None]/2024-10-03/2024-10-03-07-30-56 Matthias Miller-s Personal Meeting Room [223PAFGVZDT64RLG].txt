Matthias Miller  00:05
Are you the shy? I'm the shy. Perfect. That one's all yours. Sorry. Thank you too.

Matthias Miller  00:51
Hey, Seth, can you hear me? Maybe,

Speaker 1  01:00
maybe not. No about now,

Matthias Miller  01:10
there we go. Maybe,

Speaker 2  01:11
okay. Now I'm connected. Okay, my headset was, I think, was still off from overnight, and I put it on assuming it was just connected and it wasn't.

Matthias Miller  01:26
Every time I see the Zoom waiting room, I think of court, and it's like, Do you admit or deny? Okay, I admit anyway.

Speaker 2  01:38
Sorry. That's hilarious. I like it. Well, if they're not on the call yet, I might make some coffee. Yeah, brighten my morning.

Matthias Miller  01:50
I picked up some chai because it's one of those mornings. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  01:54
they seem to happen. All right. They're

Matthias Miller  01:58
hopping on Okay, well, I'm still making coffee. You can't stop me. It's too late. You've reached the point of every turn Exactly.

Matthias Miller  02:22
Morning Drew. I have the unfortunate situation of being a little running a little bit behind this morning, so that'll be in the office just a few minutes where you can chat till, till then,

Speaker 3  02:46
well, it sounds like talking to Dwayne. It sounds like we are fortunate people compared to people in North Carolina that they've been hauling. Dwayne and sons have been they've been hauling supplies, helping out some of the Wow. Yeah. I

Matthias Miller  03:08
mean, I just came across an article yesterday. They were talking about somebody they the whole house had been buried in mud, and the family was actually alive inside of it. Just crazy stories.

Unknown Speaker  03:22
Yeah, Hugh, the guy that works for this logistics,

Unknown Speaker  03:30
works for Dwayne's

Speaker 3  03:31
office, or for Dwayne he's here today, and he said his son, they lost their he was in that area, lost their mobile home, everything. They pretty much have clothes on their bed. Wow. Duane was just saying, there's pictures out there homes that are perfect but buying, but there's no road leading to them anymore, like, like, not just washed out in one spot, but the rigor now runs for them is where the roadies and I Chimney Rock

Unknown Speaker  04:10
or not that he said that whole town was

Unknown Speaker  04:20
like four people.

Speaker 4  04:29
Yeah, Christian management posts, or somebody from there, or something. I was a corporate thing or not. But anyway, there's a video people took about mobile home floating down the river. Wow, quarters out of the water, and it was just floating down the river, like a whole big, 80 foot mobile home, or whatever. It

Matthias Miller  04:47
was crazy.

Speaker 2  04:49
Yeah, the guys at church were saying there was a, I Well, they said there was a house floating down the river. And I asked, was a mobile home? They're like, No, this one was a full on three bedroom house. Okay?

Unknown Speaker  04:59
River. It's

Unknown Speaker  05:01
just ridiculous. Whoa.

Speaker 4  05:06
But I guess my question about the whole thing was, was this actually that much more rain than ever before, or are there a whole bunch of factors coming into why it all transpired the way it did, like just a short amount of time, or because of how either wet or dry and ready was, or,

Speaker 2  05:35
I mean, the forecasters were saying it was going to be a once in a lifetime event, from what I heard, but I was like 18 inches, I think in something like that. What is it a day? Ish, how

Speaker 4  05:50
many dams actually broke? Just one. I heard of one, but there was talk of a whole bunch more. Than thought might but

Matthias Miller  06:03
I have to think of, I mean, one of the this is, this is maybe simplistic ways of thinking. But, you know, my sisters talked about, I don't know when it was four years ago or something, maybe five, maybe it's been longer, about a major. I mean, it wasn't even that major of an ice storm that came through and just turned everything upside down. Because, well, they never get ice, right? And I wondered how much of it was just, I mean, in, in most, well, I mean, obviously you've got mountain stuff that's, that's huge. It's channeling all kinds of water and and once it, you know, it collects speed and force and all that. But how much of it too is just, hey, we've never had anything close to this severe to to wash things out

Speaker 4  06:56
places and do stuff like that, yeah,

Matthias Miller  07:01
yeah. Or even, like, even the level of trees demolished, where, if you would have had something of half the magnitude, right, some of those trees would have gotten knocked over and cleaned out, and wouldn't have created issues this time. And, yeah, to your point, would have created some awareness about where we should or shouldn't be, I don't know,

Unknown Speaker  07:23
yes, it's crazy.

Speaker 3  07:26
Yeah, he was saying there's also, like, cemeteries washed out, so there's, yeah, threes and, you know, wow, there was a shed lot down there that 65 buildings, and they're all

Speaker 4  07:46
now, when you hope your your flood insurance actually qualifies and they don't go, call it some sort of a, well, this is a, this is a catastrophic, something, Something. Flood insurance doesn't work for this.

Unknown Speaker  07:59
Yeah, exactly.

Speaker 3  08:03
Yeah. Like, Yeah, real estate there, well, you said you're never going to build them. Rebuild like,

Unknown Speaker  08:10
yeah, no, right.

Unknown Speaker  08:19
I am at my office just about to hop on.

Speaker 4  08:24
I mean, thing is, though, if you, if you took out all the land that you might possibly have some sort of a devastating natural event, never build there. Why? Where would we even build?

Speaker 2  08:38
The only thing will be hurricane. I mean, not hurricanes, while tornadoes, we have no risk of hurricanes up here, right, right? Because

Speaker 4  08:50
if you're in the bottom, you might get washed away from the top. You get blown away, build anywhere, got everybody's living in

Speaker 3  09:01
tents, I was pretty safe too. We don't. We don't even get the tornado, you do. So it's fair, that's what. I'm sure the people down there also thought the same thing.

Speaker 1  09:17
Yeah. Well, well,

Matthias Miller  09:21
yeah, all right. Seth, we don't have her. We don't have a tornado. Zach, well, there may have been a case of one, but actually the last tornado we had in our area, so yeah, obviously this is the place to be, except for all the insane amounts of snow you can get. We just, we just have a guy being investigated because he killed a mountain lion with a shovel. So it's a shovel

Unknown Speaker  09:47
that thought deserves an award or something.

Matthias Miller  09:49
Yes, let's get him on the head. Wow, but, but they're not sure if it was an assault, because he was 10 feet that it was 10 feet away, threatening him, but didn't actually like i.

Unknown Speaker  09:59
Go ahead. So

Matthias Miller  10:02
anyway, the reasons,

Speaker 3  10:04
what should he have done? Tried to,

Matthias Miller  10:07
I think, tried to scare it away, be loud, that kind of a thing. But, or,

Speaker 4  10:13
or wait till, I'd say, within three feet, so that it can be a real assault.

Matthias Miller  10:19
Yeah, exactly like, anyway, don't, don't, let's not, let's not divert with stories of we are too close to Colorado, to California and some of our dealings. Anyway.

Speaker 4  10:33
You don't have a crazy brother, just crazy people.

Matthias Miller  10:36
That's right. Yeah, that's right. Pick your marijuana, pick your crazy exactly,

Matthias Miller  10:48
that's about it,

Speaker 3  10:53
good. Um, so according to otters email next week will not work for a meeting with you, Matthias.

Matthias Miller  11:04
And it gets even worse. I'm realizing that, yeah, the 10th 17th, and it looks like the 31st bone either.

Speaker 3  11:16
So could we do you have any openings with the sales tax thing? I'm a little want to keep moving that forward, so I'm a little nervous to go too long. So do you have any openings next week?

Matthias Miller  11:30
So next week I could do Monday or Wednesday

Unknown Speaker  11:40
or Friday afternoon. What

Speaker 3  11:49
do you think drew we do? How would Wednesday? I know that's usually when you're paying invoices.

Speaker 4  11:55
Um, I think Wednesday would work.

Unknown Speaker  11:59
Wednesday, the normal time, 930 11.

Matthias Miller  12:03
I'm not free until 11. Well, I'm free from 11 to for sure, until from 11 to two. But I haven't nailed down exactly what actually, nevermind. No, Wednesday, I'm free 11 to 330

Unknown Speaker  12:27
should we plan to just do 11 to 1230 does that work? So when that would be the 911?

Unknown Speaker  12:42
To 1230 and then the following week does so we could do that. You said 14 or 16. We see the 14th, I guess time is is off, or we're open to different times that,

Speaker 1  13:05
yeah, yeah, for that, I could that could go as early as 931 of those mornings.

Speaker 3  13:17
So let's do the four 930 to go live, and if that works, yeah. And should we plan any I mean, is that you're good on the 24th then

Speaker 1  13:32
let me just triple check E, yes, I believe. I mean, at this point yes, the answer is yes.

Speaker 3  13:41
And then the 31st he said, will not work.

Unknown Speaker  13:45
31st will not work either.

Speaker 3  13:47
Why don't we? I'd say, once we get closer, we can nail down what we want to do there. So, but we have the ninth, 14th and 24th, schedule. And, yeah, I think that should be good. Okay, sounds good. Well, good. So I think the really, the only thing that we have, the only important thing on our list, is sales tax reporting. So after our call Friday morning. I send you this list of you know what we're trying to achieve by logging sales tax on sales tax payments on the invoice and Drew also send you a sales and use tax report prototype, which is basically what you're using now with, yeah, so I guess that's well, okay. And then C is talk to Josh yesterday morning, and at some point he will need details on what changes on a sales order invoice necessary. He. Tax jar. And I think we'll want to coordinate those times the firm, the ones we take make that change, suddenly it will have some impact on AR, because it will start moving, potentially moving, shifting, else orders. But so I think C is not a, b, well, C, we'll need that at some point. But it sounded like that's pretty straightforward for Josh. I guess as soon as we know what we need from him, then he might as well get that set up in his site and we could. But what have you so have you? Yeah, I guess. Where are you at after our call Friday? Where do we go from here?

Unknown Speaker  15:58
I i think

Matthias Miller  16:14
we we had left it

Speaker 1  16:17
with some question about generating a vendor invoice that ties things out to the sales order.

Matthias Miller  16:38
But we could have the same thing, but giving you a way to pull up a sales tax report for a historical period and limiting it to what was actually paid, versus well or, or just, or just freezing it, I don't know one way or the other.

Matthias Miller  17:07
Yeah, if we would store the here, let's, let's maybe do,

Unknown Speaker  17:11
let's maybe do this. I don't know if it's the right way to go about it, but

Matthias Miller  17:18
if we simply track Period, end date threshold, freeze the rates, jurisdictions and rates, the taxable and non taxable subtotal adjustment and the bad debt adjustment, And then, and then store payment date.

Unknown Speaker  17:40
And then require administrator to edit or delete Pedros.

Speaker 2  18:01
And then we can give you only an admin can set it to paid, or once it's

Unknown Speaker  18:08
once it is paid,

Unknown Speaker  18:18
to just look it up off saved record. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  18:22
we can do that. It's probably

Speaker 2  18:23
the easiest, unless you want it to just lock down as soon as they enter a date, which seems wrong.

Matthias Miller  18:30
I don't know it's generally going to be set payment. Date is generally going to be set in an X 30 anyway. Oh, okay.

Matthias Miller  18:42
Sure. So then we could run a report. So basically, what we're going to say is people should never delete sales tax history or paid sales tax history roads. As long as they don't, then we're fine. We can pull history of what we thought we paid. It should tie out to the transaction, and we don't have

Unknown Speaker  19:07
broken down line items. Is that

Matthias Miller  19:13
it's either that or we need to come up with a way of creating adjusting vendor invoices.

Speaker 1  19:22
Well, how would we do it? The other way to do it now that I'm talking myself back into what it was talking myself out of,

Matthias Miller  19:35
is, instead of a payment date, we would link it to a vendor, invoice ID I

Unknown Speaker  19:47
I don't know

Matthias Miller  19:49
accounting impact is going to get it feels to me like the only the real gain that we have of tying this into having knowledge in accounting. Which sales order it is is that we can use the account balance diagnostic report to figure out sales tax balances. And it seems to me like we could just as effectively write a custom report, rather than have the complexity of like needing, needing the vendor invoice to have 100 lines tied out to sales orders or something like that.

Speaker 3  20:32
So the initial proposal would be something like, yeah, have sales tax report that says, here's what you owe to

Unknown Speaker  20:45
the state of Indiana. And then you would just, we would not create a vendor invoice

Speaker 3  20:58
before that, like, let's say it's $50,000 give what you're saying is true. Two would still have the option to just create a vendor invoice. All right, if you know, for that 50,000 just as a get it paid, right? Is that how you're thinking? You would create a vendor invoice to pay it. But what's linking back to,

Speaker 4  21:19
well, I'm thinking we would just have something that just creates a journal entry to pay it.

Unknown Speaker  21:24
Oh, okay,

Speaker 3  21:26
made a journal entry with all these line items, possibly in a tie effect.

Speaker 4  21:32
No, no, it would just be a journal entry to the account. And then if we can pull the report like he's saying, that will tell us this journal entry of payment record matches with this period record of what was paid. I'm

Speaker 3  21:55
sure we don't want to do something like, I'm thinking, something similar to the asset management, like where we have, here's the asset here all the invoices linked to it, like a journal entry that that goes to the report picks out all of

Unknown Speaker  22:14
that would have a link back to

Speaker 3  22:16
that. Okay, we could, we could tell this is way off, but we, I think if we had that report we wanted to do that, we could export the sales tax report and easily turn it into a an import a transactions, like we do with payroll, like we did with those note holders. We could, I don't think we want to do it long term, but we could. We could essentially, rather than, say, 50,000 we could have 200 line items.

Matthias Miller  22:55
Well, it looks a little different to me to directly create a journal entry

Unknown Speaker  23:01
than it does to push this through vendor invoice.

Speaker 3  23:05
Well, we're not, I don't pushing to a vendor invoice is, is not a big deal our side, is it? I mean, it's if we can do it just as easily.

Speaker 4  23:16
To me, if there's a report that says, here's what you paid on that day. I mean, that's, I think that would work.

Speaker 3  23:30
I think can we? Can we, then also, is that what you're saying the payment date? I mean, show that on the sales order itself, like the payment, payment, date and amount as well.

Unknown Speaker  23:49
Yeah, we could,

Speaker 3  23:52
I think that there's enough value there in just answering questions to, you know those odd situations where, well, I think I might have listed some here, but

Speaker 4  24:08
if, if we have a button to create the like from the report, say, Okay, I want to pay sales tax, so then It pushes me to a transaction link between the two. I'm

Matthias Miller  24:24
going to assume it's some plate that this would be, it would create one transaction per state. So, right, right,

Speaker 3  24:34
very similar to, like when you make a sale on an asset, right?

Speaker 4  24:37
That kind of thing. Um, now I might not, I don't know. I mean, again, it doesn't necessarily have to have all the lines if we can have the report to go back to, you know,

Matthias Miller  24:52
Seth, what if we would add a? I.

Matthias Miller  25:01
A tax history row ID, okay, and we would have an x 30 that creates it, creates it. We would add these as custom fields to the transaction RG, like we do for asset and so you would store the sales order ID and the tax history row ID, okay? And then just have an X 30 that runs in the report.

Speaker 1  25:28
Have a unique record per state. We should

Speaker 2  25:34
so it would be a transaction for every time you pay a state. Basically, is that what you're thinking correct? And just itemized out by sales order and row ID,

Speaker 1  25:45
yes, and then payment ID would be, then you would have a transaction ID, which would be, I

Unknown Speaker  26:09
then you would just look up payment date from the index, if people want to know what was paid when, and then you could see the transaction i So

Matthias Miller  26:56
and then on the The other thing we're missing here is on the

Unknown Speaker  27:08
where we're supposed to be finding this, yeah, if

Unknown Speaker  27:21
that Yeah,

Matthias Miller  27:33
yeah, okay, we'll need some kind of way to tie out between so this would be a vendor type. Do you already have a vendor for one of these

Unknown Speaker  27:48
state which the page, like

Speaker 4  27:53
Ohio Secretary of State or Treasury, Treasury or state?

Matthias Miller  28:00
Okay, so West Virginia, for example, we would need some kind of way.

Matthias Miller  28:21
We could call it something like sales Tax vendor for State.

Unknown Speaker  28:41
And then I

Matthias Miller  29:27
does your bad debt? Will everything here?

Matthias Miller  29:38
It would all just go against the sales tax liability account, right?

Speaker 3  29:48
You're saying Here we have a write off, either what the write off or an overpay.

Matthias Miller  29:55
Well, does bad debt? I mean, does, yeah, at all. We go. We expensed it.

Unknown Speaker  30:04
It's all either just a credit or debit to that same account, until we get into use taxes, but use taxes separately,

Matthias Miller  30:19
and then we would need you to specify. When you pay Do you just want to? Do you want to just select from one of the one of these accounts,

Speaker 1  30:38
when you say, Well, no, because it's going to be all this is,

Matthias Miller  30:43
what account does it come out of?

Speaker 4  30:46
Can that be something we put in the transaction once we get there? So

Matthias Miller  30:50
we're planning to, I think we're going to need to fully create the transaction. So we need something to say. But could we temporarily create a corresponding sorry, I should know which one debit credit row for something like accounts payable, and you can just switch it to the

Unknown Speaker  31:06
default.

Speaker 4  31:09
Well, it's gonna be the bank account, you know. So you check

Speaker 3  31:15
you can't you set, can't you set the default payment on the vendor? Won't that work like we do now, you said it, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  31:31
down right there.

Matthias Miller  31:33
Give tape, right, right, right, right. Okay, so up here, then,

Unknown Speaker  31:40
require, require, payment, type, I,

Matthias Miller  32:04
so Seth, you could have ABC could file in Indiana.

Speaker 1  32:09
Theoretically, I don't know if this happens, but set the vendor and create a counteracting debit credit account based on the payment type of the vendor. There are macros for this,

Speaker 2  32:36
all right, just actually to create an account you're saying.

Matthias Miller  32:39
So set in AD, okay, found that

Unknown Speaker  32:47
a row that

Unknown Speaker  32:49
does the payment type have a have accounts on it

Matthias Miller  32:55
or not, gets linked through the accounting company. Okay, so you have to go, but there's meander around. But yes, yeah, yeah, but it is sometimes. I

Speaker 2  33:03
think our data model could be simplified between districts and accounting companies and all that. But hey,

Speaker 3  33:12
well, if I wish we wouldn't have districts. I wish we would have never this is we should only have companies and not terribly confusing. We stuck down that route a long time ago with, yeah, that's direct. And now,

Unknown Speaker  33:31
yeah, it'll be very painful to ever remove it.

Unknown Speaker  33:35
What was that?

Speaker 2  33:36
It'd be pretty painful to remove it now. I mean, it could, you could do it, but it be, it takes some work.

Speaker 3  33:42
I think eventually we'll want to, because it's just like some some reporting used to like per district, and others per company. And anybody that this is a lot just knows. But it's,

Unknown Speaker  33:55
yeah, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  33:56
I agree. It's

Matthias Miller  33:57
sometimes when I think of districts, I think about which side of Whiteside road you live on in Kansas? Set that's how the Amish districts are. Oh, it's actually not which side. It's, it's, it's, do you have a lane on Whiteside, or are you east of it? Gotcha? Okay. Random piece of useless trivia.

Unknown Speaker  34:24
Okay, so

Matthias Miller  34:27
these are for Josh. Josh will add a check box here, or Seth will add a field change to update this from the orders invoiced, break out the trans attack tax, which would be the other in the other rate, convert the tax star rates to an RG, so we have history on those. So this is, sorry,

Speaker 2  34:48
Jack it up to speed. This is on

Speaker 1  34:53
the sales order. That is correct. We get to know. I.

Matthias Miller  35:03
And then so you have any accounting transaction where we'll add these two fields.

Unknown Speaker  35:20
Oh,

Speaker 2  35:23
does it sound right to label, label the Sales Order field on the transaction as specifically for tax history, just so people know, like we could always in the future. I

Matthias Miller  35:43
Wow, I could probably typing going no no caffeine on a Thursday morning.

Unknown Speaker  35:51
I don't know for too much.

Matthias Miller  35:52
I'm not sure which is maybe too much. Yes, I like that. I

Unknown Speaker  36:04
Okay, this is,

Matthias Miller  36:10
yeah, how, however. I mean, feel free to adjust names.

Speaker 2  36:13
No, I like it because, I mean, in the future, you could theoretically use the SNM ID for something else. But right now, let's just make it clear this is just for tax history,

Unknown Speaker  36:21
agreed.

Matthias Miller  36:23
All right, so vendors will be able to specify from the state payment site validate against duplicate vendors for District PLUS state combinations through the tax History ID, which is with the unique ID Period End Date, um, and the then the transaction ID

Speaker 2  36:49
is that, is any of this editable in detail screen ever? Or is this all this happens in import, or if you really need to fix it up editable report,

Unknown Speaker  37:01
I would think so. I like that helper

Matthias Miller  37:11
report to figure out what adjustments should be added for old jurisdictions. Create rows to reverse them, add adjustment for the current jurisdiction and next 30. Then that uses that to add new rows. It will need to prompt for, oh, this is fun.

Matthias Miller  37:37
The vendor needs to specify the filing frequency.

Unknown Speaker  37:53
And this is the sales tax vendor

Speaker 4  38:02
or semi annual, if you're if you add it anyway, it doesn't take any more. I mean, we're hoping they never actually slow down to the point of it being semi annual, but

Unknown Speaker  38:15
that's fair.

Speaker 4  38:19
Yeah, and some states are different, like Ohio, you have to like different states are going to have different levels as to whether you're semi quarterly. Like New York, currently it's quarterly, but there's no way you would be portable

Unknown Speaker  38:35
with those amounts, right?

Matthias Miller  38:41
All right, so then here,

Matthias Miller  38:56
do you would you want to just slap the vendor in the actually, we should probably, why would we put in the vendor here?

Unknown Speaker  39:06
Seems reasonable.

Speaker 1  39:21
And that way, when there's a reversal, you can guarantee that at a whatever, it's not going to whatever. Just makes it simple. Yeah, I like it

Matthias Miller  39:34
all right. Then accounting method on the accounting impacted on the payment method. We had a checkbox called adjust sales tax liability, which you can turn on if, if, if the payment method applies to the so balance and then on the accounting impact check for references.

Unknown Speaker  39:58
No.

Matthias Miller  40:01
We should probably name this so allow configuring the payment method to say it all suggests sales tax liability for bad debt or and then on the sales order accounting impact, if the payment method affects sales tax liability, this only affects the bad debt adjustment. Only affects,

Unknown Speaker  40:37
oh, it's not true, is it? I Is

Speaker 4  40:52
this for your little updating of the of the sales tax button,

Matthias Miller  41:00
yes, but doesn't this also need to. We also need to create, when you have a bad debt write off that we need to create an adjustment to the sales tax liability

Speaker 3  41:13
as well. Well, can you only if, can you set it to where? Okay, the people using bad debt adjustments should, ideally, they would just select that payment method, and then if there is sales tax, it lowers it appropriately. If there's no sales tax, then it just

Speaker 4  41:35
like when I select that bad debt payment type, it just does what is needed, which

Speaker 3  41:39
is, if a tax exempt sale, right, start pay $20 it just the full $20 goes to bad debt, if it has a 7% tax rate, yeah, then $19 and $18.60 goes To bad debt, it would then create a split transaction. Can we do that, like have one? Okay, you can have a conditional payment method that creates, I

Unknown Speaker  42:20
I'm going to get you

Matthias Miller  42:27
up to a world class expert on accounting impact

Speaker 4  42:36
on that transaction. We're also going to need the ability to adjust the amount. Normally, it comes due to rounding differences between us and the state and some things like that, or between tax jar and us in the state like, you know, they say this is due. We say no, it's actually this much do. And there's also thing, depending when you file, you get a discount. So somehow in that transaction, we need to be able to write an extra line, if we need to add a little measure, to take away a little bit,

Matthias Miller  43:14
you can, I mean, you'll be able to open up the transaction then and make any edits you

Unknown Speaker  43:20
want to. We'll just like,

Speaker 3  43:22
you wouldn't tie those back to any specific right? Well, I guess it'd be up to you. Wow, you probably would make no

Speaker 4  43:31
it does become an adjustment. I

Unknown Speaker  43:46
Yeah, all right, so

Matthias Miller  43:59
then we have a sales tax report. I'm back to using a repeating list Seth. I think it's easier to have the report

Unknown Speaker  44:09
handle it than having separate rows. Be

Matthias Miller  44:13
sure to start including SDI buildings then add an x3 to create transactions, exclude line items that are already paid

Unknown Speaker  44:30
tax history for

Speaker 4  44:31
I would also want to import the payments on those sales orders then too, so that we don't have to be going and doing all that stuff. Talk about that now. I would

Matthias Miller  44:44
so this would create the transaction. The transaction would automatically, automatically link back to the sales tax history, RG, so that those are linked together, and you can see that those are paid.

Speaker 3  44:56
So how would this be visible? Then on, say, the same. On each sales order record with these like

Matthias Miller  45:05
on the sales order record, you would see a transaction ID and a payment date, which would be the transaction date.

Speaker 3  45:12
So you would have a trend, a sales tax transactions, RG or cable with with all of them combined, like you would see the payments you would see initially, you would see, here's what we're liable for a time of invoicing, and then here's the payments, right?

Matthias Miller  45:32
Yeah, my thought is that end of period. I still think it's better just doing it at end of period, so that if jurisdiction changes intra period, but you don't have weird stuff, so end of period you would go add the liabilities, which would handle all the reversals and all the all this other kind of stuff. And

Speaker 3  45:59
would it basically work like applying actual cost for, like, raw materials, like you go for the period your liability, sales tax liability, will continue to grow every time you invoice. Right? It's not like that will be sitting there at zero for the entire quarter or month, but then it'll it'll continue to grow. But then when you run the reporting, you're basically saying, okay, apply what it is as of today, and then update.

Unknown Speaker  46:32
Okay, right?

Matthias Miller  46:36
And technically, what might happen if, if you wait too long to run it, you might have a I don't know why this would happen. We would exclude uninvoiced Well, or we reverse liabilities on an invoice. So if you uninvoice it, make sure that The liability is zero,

Unknown Speaker  47:04
note that if I

Matthias Miller  47:20
so there could be weird situations where, if you wait until the 15th to run this thing that you might and It was

Unknown Speaker  47:33
before, before,

Speaker 4  47:41
but if you haven't paid any sales tax on it, and something legitimate changes about the jurisdiction or the you know, if you had invoiced it and then you said no, then,

Matthias Miller  47:53
okay, here's where it could get weird. If somebody changes the period the invoice date from one period to the next, or to skip a period. So it was invoiced in May, and so we moved it to be invoiced in July. Then in June, when you file, you would do a reversal for your May. And then in July, when you file, file, you would pay sales tax again, we all works. Technically, it's correct, it's weird, but yeah,

Unknown Speaker  48:29
right. Well, there's,

Speaker 3  48:30
there's no other way we would solve for that thing. Well, now depends when you

Speaker 4  48:35
moved it. If you moved it in July to July, then you never would have reversed it

Unknown Speaker  48:42
for me, right, correct, correct,

Matthias Miller  48:47
yes, exactly.

Unknown Speaker  48:50
Move it into a future period too often I would think

Matthias Miller  48:56
I'm going to pick up a Sherlock Sherlock Holmes novel or a story to have easier mysteries to solve. All right, so I think this is back of the napkin. I mean, pretty big napkin, but back of the napkin, the only thing it doesn't handle is use case or use tax.

Speaker 4  49:20
Do you need anything on that report? Prototype that I send over

Unknown Speaker  49:29
look, there's,

Speaker 4  49:33
I mean, it's a high likelihood that it doesn't all make sense well, that if you know what you need, then we should be good to go

Speaker 3  49:42
through now that we're, we're feeling, we're identifying, am I correct that we're, we now have a new type of contact, which is a sales tax vendor, or right, we're so you could possibly. On that vendor also. So like, like, how do they want it broken? How? Like, you're depending on your Well, let's go to the report and look at that. But I think that

Speaker 4  50:12
particularly creating a report per vendor rather than to state, right

Matthias Miller  50:22
that could actually, I don't know, man, I'm afraid about entitlement creeping into this generation.

Speaker 4  50:37
Somebody, just this morning, I got a notification of somebody posting that millennial song,

Speaker 4  50:49
millennials. And anyway, he's like, at the end, he's, he's budding millennials, of course. But then he's like, you know, and we're going to be turning everything over to millennials. Soon it's like, oh, oh, please pray for millennials.

Unknown Speaker  51:08
So what are millennials? What age group

Speaker 4  51:09
means? My age group? Yeah, Drew and I born like mid 80s to 2000 like those that became of age of became adults within the millennial first couple of years, and known for for

Matthias Miller  51:27
this, you

Speaker 4  51:29
know, ideal that that we've been able to think and figure things out for ourselves and don't run a lot of input, and yet we sponge off our parents for forever and think that you say, think

Speaker 4  51:44
like, you know, facial hair and a man bond and and your essential oils will solve everything. I can be a millionaire without going and working type of thing. Or there's a lot of good things about them, too. But anyway, yeah, probably one of the main things my columns over here, with all the sales tax, the different taxes broke out this is, this is a North Carolina specific thing. So here again, if it's something where we want to create a report that's like has specific elements. It would reduce a lot of noise on the report for the other states, but this is a one size fits all, so therefore it's big and has a ton of information that a lot of states aren't actually going to need. But anyway, so it's the way North Carolina breaks it out. You have a 2% county tax, and then you have so those column N and column O, they both collect a 2% county tax. It's just column O is for certain counties that also have another transit tax. So the total tax is higher. Those two columns of the 2.0 county tax are, they need to be added together, because it's still a 2.0 county tax for all of those counties. So there's a space that I need to fill in the total. So the only way for me to do it in my limited programming was to grade two separate and then just add those two columns together.

Matthias Miller  53:29
So you need, okay, wait, but is this transit tax, the other special jurisdiction tax that we would see in? Okay, so, but you said the help me out. So this is a 2% tax across the board,

Speaker 4  53:48
and this county that has a 2% tax, yes,

Matthias Miller  53:52
but could we just have a column based on the county tax totals and the other tax that gets paid?

Speaker 4  54:01
Yes? Yeah, I just didn't have a way of doing that here. Okay? Because you'll notice, like in column K, we have 6.757 7.5 7.5 and it's Yeah, combination of 2% county or two and a quarter percent county or or the transit tax, or the one including a five half percent transit. You know, it's all those differences. So if you scroll down, you can see the numbers that I actually totals that I need. Row about 80 or so there. So I need to know the total sales tax and taxable income for the state, for the 2% for the 2.25 and for the 5% transit like I need all eight of those numbers, plus I need a. The like. So if you go up to the counties again, I will need so take Orange County there. I will need the $231.55 for that county, and I will need the transit tax for that county. So I need each county. I need the tax for that county in the different brackets. I don't need the state number, the 488, I don't need that's just one total state. I All I need is a state total. But I need the county numbers there.

Matthias Miller  55:38
So you need to know, basically you need this for the state, and then broken down per county as well.

Unknown Speaker  55:49
So

Matthias Miller  55:51
couldn't we if we just had a

Matthias Miller  56:01
for county and track in transit, if we would only

Unknown Speaker  56:07
we can't do it for Yeah, we could do it for both, assess, writing the report. We can do anything.

Matthias Miller  56:15
We could have a column for each, except for city tax, but for all other taxes, state it really doesn't matter, of course, that's going to be constant across the board, but unless state tax changes, but we could have a column for each jurisdiction and rate in your report, so that you could then easily go down and say, okay, for Mecklenburg, we have this no except you need taxable and non taxable amounts, right? Taxable,

Speaker 4  56:57
um, I made, if you'll see line like 74 there basically made another row for for bad debt. So it's like a it's like a third section. We have a taxable section, I mean a non taxable section for the county, taxable section for the county, and then a bad debt section for the county.

Speaker 4  57:22
So actually, there's one of those pet peeves that I need to get them to change. We have Yadkin County and we have Yadkin two different counties, so I always need to add those two together.

Unknown Speaker  57:34
What do you but right here,

Speaker 4  57:37
like there, it's separated out as two different vendors because dealers are selecting it. There's, there's two options, and they should, I guess it's some, somehow, something with fax jar, it brings, there's two options, and they some pick one, and some pick the other, or something.

Speaker 3  57:55
But there is only a yak county or one, right?

Speaker 4  57:59
And it's, it's just a do. It's kind of like duplicated vendors. You know, it's two different names for the same thing.

Speaker 3  58:05
But that would be something dealers, too. Is it, or is it? It might

Speaker 4  58:09
be something within tax jar. I don't know. Yeah, it might be, I don't know. Somehow, depending who it is, somebody, some, select one another, select another, or they, it hits. But that might be a Josh or Dwayne thing to look at.

Unknown Speaker  58:24
I'm not sure.

Unknown Speaker  58:33
I'm gonna guess I'm

Unknown Speaker  58:45
it's so TJ,

Matthias Miller  58:47
oh, come on. I don't know what is wrong with my tooth. All

Speaker 1  59:00
right, let's try this again. Let me turn on Bluetooth on my phone. Never had that problem before. Okay, so anyway, it's neither here nor there. That's something that probably chase with Josh or Dwayne i So,

Matthias Miller  59:29
you see, we need go ahead. Well,

Speaker 4  59:31
then also, you know, depend. It depends which state it is so, but this includes everything that I'd ever need. Um row, 75 and 76 you know, there's the the sales total, there's a bad debt total, and then there's a sales and bad debt total, because some of them put them all together.

Matthias Miller  59:51
So if we would create one report per vendor, then then we would know. Basically the vendor. Then we have a setting on the vendor, does bad debt get broken out, right, right, right. And then this would need to be a separate report. We would have two more reports. It might be the same report, but different formats, but it would be, you can run the report and get the grand totals for these, or you could run the report and get this broken down by county.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:31
Or

Unknown Speaker  1:00:34
could you do a right pain for that

Matthias Miller  1:00:37
sure, when you select the county, you would show the show the breakout, yeah, we can do that.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:45
That'd be great.

Matthias Miller  1:00:50
Um, all right, so on the vendor contacts.

Speaker 4  1:01:01
Um, there'd be, I don't know how you want to word it, but it'd be bad debt and sales tax combined or separated, whichever way you want to go from default, I guess. And then also sales tax and use tax combined or separated. Okay, so I mean those two settings is what we would need.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:38
I okay

Unknown Speaker  1:02:20
all right,

Matthias Miller  1:02:24
so Then here sales tax. I'm

Unknown Speaker  1:02:40
i Well, you can't default. I

Speaker 1  1:02:58
don't know if we want to do that or not. I it?

Speaker 2  1:03:07
You could, no, you couldn't.

Matthias Miller  1:03:12
You do a list. Yes,

Speaker 2  1:03:14
I was thinking, if you have a vendor, then you can do a list. If you don't have the vendor, you can't,

Matthias Miller  1:03:21
right? But you need the vendor, yeah, exactly,

Unknown Speaker  1:03:27
and it would just use below used,

Matthias Miller  1:03:37
all right, so then,

Unknown Speaker  1:03:42
then,

Speaker 3  1:03:53
your thought is, this would give you doing a sub pane you can show totals on the main report, and then only if you Need it broken down, the sub page shows you that,

Matthias Miller  1:04:07
and then, okay, so explain to me, So use tax is,

Matthias Miller  1:04:20
explain to me use tax.

Speaker 4  1:04:21
Okay, um, so it's based on who the end user is. So the end user pays the sales tax. Well, for contractor projects where you are adding to the real property, the contractor is considered the end user, not the person who owns the property. So we're building a pole barn writings real property, for example, therefore, the contractor pays sales tax on the items that he purchases and. And his invoice to the property owner is non taxable. There's no sales tax on right? Use Tax comes in when he purchases all his stuff tax exempt because, well, he's a contractor, and so some of his stuff is, you know, he doesn't need to pay sales tax on everything. Obviously, got it. Then the materials that you're not charging that are in invoices, you're not charging sales tax to the consumer, you then need to pay use tax, which is exact same rate, but the state just thinks about it different. So that's why it's use tax. Now, some states, they throw it all together and they say, Well, here's the Sales and Use Tax you're due. Others split it out. Ohio splits it out. Yeah, anyway. So these would just be examples of, we build them, and then we go to the invoice, raw materials cost for that invoice, and we say, Okay, this is 6% 6.75 rate jurisdiction, so we create a use tax liability based on raw materials cost, not on the total sale. And then that sale that so is actually non taxable, and we need to work on the sales side then for them to calculate in this 6.75% of the cost, and make that be figured in when, if they say, Okay, we use 10 two by fours. Here's our cost of two by fours. They need to add that in their sales number in order to be covering our use tax cost. But raw materials should still the raw materials number on the invoice. Since we have that is going to be as accurate as we know for what to base this on, because it's supposed to be based on our cost, not on our cost plus market. We don't want to take the invoice amount off of the invoice. You know these $24,000 they might actually sell for 35,000 or for 100,000 we don't know, depending on our markup, but it's supposed to be based on the cost we would have paid tax on had we paid sales tax when we purchased them.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:36
Okay,

Speaker 4  1:07:37
only on materials. Right? The Labor does not get taxed. So these right,

Speaker 3  1:07:43
the same subtotal amount to the like these could both be $50,000 projects. The lower one is just, I don't know we there was way more labor in that one or or our market was just way higher than it was on the other one. Sure.

Matthias Miller  1:08:02
Okay, so this is only for, okay, so if, if you know, vinyl structures is kind of the poster child story of this. But Bren down the road comes down and says, I have a project, and I need, I need I need a stack of two buys, and he goes and buys it that taxes, that is, that is sold to him. Well, I guess then it actually depends, okay, if he's a contractor that's sold to him completely tax exempt. If it's sold to him as a, yeah, as if you guys were just selling the hardware now part of a project. Then Then he pays, then it's a taxable sales order, right? But if, but if he's a contractor, and he says, I'm building, I won't compete with you because I'm not building sheds or pool barns, but I'm building a deck. And for some reason, you guys have stuff that I need, then you will. That's when, no, that's completely it's still tax exempt. He's responsible for it. But when you guys are building the pool barn, right? And you pull this much of raw materials. Then, by the way, does this apply to to sheds as well?

Speaker 3  1:09:30
It can for, like some of our cells, cell storage projects, where we're putting particle buildings on a piece of renting out and then intending to sell the whole project to an investor is, we are liable there to pay the the use tax on on those

Matthias Miller  1:09:54
right and on most but on most sheds, you pay sales tax on the entire shit anyway. Yeah. The

Speaker 4  1:10:02
because it's, it's considered a portable unit that can be moved off the real property. So it's not at it's not adding them to the value of the property.

Matthias Miller  1:10:09
But on, on sites, theoretically, could be subject to use tax. You're just lazy, and you have the people pay sales tax. Could be, yeah, or, depending on the scenario,

Speaker 4  1:10:24
I mean, it's, it's going to be, you know, if it was an on site build, because there's only a six foot opening to get back to his backyard, you know, but it is a shed that very easily stood on the road. That's that gets the level. How do you decide?

Matthias Miller  1:10:38
Okay, fair enough, I'm being

Unknown Speaker  1:10:41
backyard.

Matthias Miller  1:10:43
I'm being very perstigated. You're trying to understand it makes sense on the

Speaker 4  1:10:49
weather or not, it should be a use taxable item. We need to come up with a specific criteria that that's going to be understood by salespeople, or else the system knows that, Oh, it's this kind of a design, therefore it's a use taxable set, something like that. These

Matthias Miller  1:11:10
are not tied. These pool barns are not tied. Do we have a sample pool bar sales?

Speaker 3  1:11:16
We do there's, if you look from Brian Lloyd, that would be a good one. Or no, dude, do that one gets messy? Do uh Tony cook in North Carolina?

Matthias Miller  1:11:30
All right, there we go see this guy. All right. So here we have just a straight up. This one doesn't have any raw material cost. Oh, but it's put tied up to a building. So this, this one,

Speaker 3  1:11:45
matches exactly what you said. We were just lazy discharge sales tax on the whole thing. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:11:53
no, we didn't have program before. Let's skip the blame here.

Speaker 3  1:11:59
Well, we never asked, kind of like Errol. The people at Errol said, we can't. What does Nelson say? We can't, we can't. Know what we don't. What do you haven't? Told us.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:13
Love it. Um,

Matthias Miller  1:12:18
so. But what would normally happen is you would have, you would have so we could say, if the sales order is tied, no, but the building is still going to have the Aren't you still going to specify the the raw material cost on the building itself.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:40
Yeah. So how

Matthias Miller  1:12:46
so if it's, if it's, is it just for sales orders for whole buildings?

Speaker 3  1:12:53
No, it'll also be for so I think the criteria that we'll have to, we'll have to, and this could vary state by state, but I think we'll have to determine what is the criteria for it to be real property and use have used tax, which is, I don't know, I imagine something like it needs to be it needs to have a building, a stand attached. The Salesforce needs to have a stand attached. It needs to be built on site, and it also has to be greater than a certain amount of square footage, or something like that. These, these storage units, are kind of a one off thing where I think we should just have a a manual, possibly a manual way of saying, Okay, for this, for these, use, use, use tags. But

Speaker 2  1:13:49
shouldn't we just have a checkbox on the sales order that's defaulted for most, for the ones that we decide on, and then you could an admin can manually change it say, this should actually be treated as real property. So it'd be use tax, not

Speaker 3  1:14:04
sales tax. You're saying still, still use the criteria, so you default it, yeah, yeah. That would be perfect, because you'll have to have that at the time you make the sale, so you resend it properly to the customer,

Matthias Miller  1:14:21
right? So we would okay when, when you present it to the customer, the tax,

Speaker 4  1:14:32
it's non taxable, and it doesn't show up and

Speaker 3  1:14:35
right? Your invoice, I believe, has to be formatted differently. So I guess that's another question on who would we work with on that is that Josh like, instead of, am I correct, drew that these invoices, if it's real property we're doing use tax, it has to be broken out

Unknown Speaker  1:14:58
as a. As

Speaker 3  1:15:00
materials and labor separately. Okay, are we sure that it has to be because of the fact that we're is that only if people are tracking off of their materials numbers to pay their use tax like most people? I

Speaker 4  1:15:18
don't know. Um, I guess it's a thing where the customer can require it that way,

Unknown Speaker  1:15:31
like, and it probably varies by state.

Speaker 3  1:15:35
I'm wondering if, for the sake of this conversation, if we should just look at it like, okay, obviously we don't know all the criteria and the details on what quantifies something to have, use tax or not, but maybe just build like, like Seth said, just for for the time being built use tax reporting in such a way that it's just a manual check box on each sales order, and then, if that's checked for use tax, then, then here's what happens. And then we later, we have to do some research and figure out on the other side what, what is that criteria? I don't know is that,

Speaker 4  1:16:19
yeah, well, because, I mean, in one way, just simply the quoting of the project, whoever's doing that needs to know that, okay, if we normally marked up our our materials by 20% and they have a way of figuring out what that's going to be, they need to now mark them up by 27% to cover that sale, that use tax, because it never like the the end invoice, the person looking at it does not see, oh, they're charging me use tax like there's nothing they're like. In fact, if you do, they can legally go and refuse to pay it. But

Speaker 3  1:16:59
your thinking is adding another field here, basically for use tax,

Matthias Miller  1:17:06
yeah, I guess if you do, if you have it as tax exempt, then, then you would have an editable Use tax. And, but really the but then the and then, but then we need to define, okay, and if your raw material cost changes,

Speaker 3  1:17:34
then it's you're in. We would have to treat it same as if your invoice self total changes,

Matthias Miller  1:17:39
sure. So, so we would, and then we would just make would just make adjustments to use tax, you know, if you, if you find out your actual material cost change, or something like that, yeah, sure. Say.

Speaker 3  1:17:51
The formula for that would be, if you have no, if you have, if there is no actual raw materials cost at the time you're calculating use tax used in standard for Ontario cause? Well, yeah, if because, because, at times we're going to be paying, we could be paying in a use tax before we have actual costs applied, at which point we would use the standard cause. But then if there is a change to standard cost, or actual cost is updated, then we need to look at that.

Speaker 3  1:18:40
I think we're we're looking at first of the use tax thing being used on a sales order, like in sales is probably something we would have in place, hopefully by first, by the end of the year. But we do have some of those units for self storage projects. We would have a bunch of those that we would if we had this functionality day we would start moving those over and pay. We have a bunch of units that we are liable to pay use tax on that haven't been pages because we, we haven't given it any attention yet.

Matthias Miller  1:19:30
Okay, let's, let's see if we can, if the checkbox is checked. I mean, technically, you could have a use tax on if you have a raw materials cost specified by, do you want to allow people to allow people to specify raw materials costs if there's a building attached? I

Unknown Speaker  1:19:44
don't know if you can right now or not.

Unknown Speaker  1:19:46
No, it Well, I

Speaker 4  1:19:51
mean, it would have to default Fill by whatever the FBI cost is.

Matthias Miller  1:19:54
Well, we would just, I think what we would do is we would just sum the build. Things, raw material cost, and this raw material cost for use tax purposes,

Speaker 3  1:20:04
well, but you shouldn't be able to do both. If you okay, you need to put it all through the building. If there's a building, if not, it's, yeah, it's one or the

Matthias Miller  1:20:19
other. And do you want to allow raw material cost invoices, or is it just, if it has a building attached,

Unknown Speaker  1:20:25
they allow use tax?

Speaker 3  1:20:28
No, it could also be raw materials cost. Yeah, actually, it could. Here's Larry's favorite example of use tax. So we buy doorknobs for our buildings, and then we need to replace one on our office. So technically, we're due to pay use tax on that. We're not going to go back to the vendor and say, You know what on that invoice. We're 500 499 or tax exempt from the one is charged. We on our own, but then we would create an invoice to ourselves. We could and then they use tags on that,

Matthias Miller  1:21:09
okay, but then on the sales tax history, we now need a you can have a bad, no, you can't. You can never have a bad debt adjustment on use tax, because you still use the material, right?

Unknown Speaker  1:21:27
Yeah, I would think so.

Matthias Miller  1:21:34
And use tax, by definition, is always taxable. So I think what we could do is a use tax subtotal adjustment.

Unknown Speaker  1:21:48
Well,

Speaker 4  1:21:51
I mean, you could, you could decide that, oh, that was never supposed to have use tax. That was supposed to be a sales tax. You know, a month later,

Matthias Miller  1:22:02
I think what we could do is set the row as okay, if over here on this building, we have 52,000 and change. So in this case, I would file this as use tax. 52,000 taxable, 70, sorry, 75,000 non taxable. Right?

Unknown Speaker  1:22:35
Is that correct?

Speaker 4  1:22:36
Well, you're saying non sales taxable, like the wholesale is not taxable by sales. So we have, yeah, just the 52,000

Unknown Speaker  1:22:54
wouldn't subtract your 52 from the 125

Unknown Speaker  1:22:56
it's No,

Unknown Speaker  1:23:01
let me, let me, it's

Speaker 4  1:23:03
part of your gross sales. Your gross, you know, it would come in the column of non taxable sales, like the index,

Matthias Miller  1:23:14
okay? So here you have, so you would show no taxable sales,

Speaker 4  1:23:20
right? Because, I mean, that's thinking it's not taxable as far as sales tax goes. It's part of our non taxable sales. We just since we used up these materials, and nobody ever paid sales tax on them, we now have to pay use tax on those materials. It

Speaker 3  1:23:37
would help to clarify on the spreadsheet, if the non tax the spreadsheet, we're showing the same amounts, and usually the non taxable sales would be, like 50,000 or, you know, be much higher, right?

Matthias Miller  1:23:50
Like, in this case, in our example, I mean, if you're using just ratios, this should be something closer to 75,000 perhaps,

Speaker 3  1:23:58
right? Yeah, yeah, that's what the customer's paying is that's the sales up total of 75,000

Matthias Miller  1:24:04
but do you want so gross sales? Oh,

Speaker 4  1:24:08
but I need the number. I need the taxable the use taxable number. I need to be able to collect.

Matthias Miller  1:24:16
Again, that's what I wonder. If we want gross sales, taxable sales, non taxable sales. And then use, use taxable materials. Yeah, use taxable materials.

Matthias Miller  1:24:37
And then here we have a use taxable materials, subtotal adjustment.

Matthias Miller  1:24:56
And then I. And then, and so this is still just based on, this would all be non taxable. Bad debt doesn't matter because it's non taxable. Here we have the checkbox and then handle I

Matthias Miller  1:26:01
and I think right there, and if we really wanted to, I don't know if you guys want to do this,

Matthias Miller  1:26:11
but we could do something along the lines of, I

Unknown Speaker  1:26:17
thought we had something here. I I move them. Did we move them to the accounting company? Didn't we? Maybe not.

Unknown Speaker  1:26:42
Where did we move our we moved it on the company, record builders.

Matthias Miller  1:26:55
Obviously wouldn't go on the builder, but we could do something like we did. I

Speaker 1  1:27:06
I wouldn't be there. Let's do like our labor intensive,

Matthias Miller  1:27:14
where you could just specify an expression to determine the default

Speaker 3  1:27:19
you mean, whether it's use tax or not? Yeah, well, could we? What could we for right now, just add a an option by the tax exempt. Also add an option for use tax, and maybe just make so that just an admin can manually select it sure

Speaker 4  1:27:41
and require it to be tax exempt in order for this one to be checked,

Unknown Speaker  1:27:45
yes.

Speaker 3  1:27:52
So you have three options now, sales tax, tax exempt, or use tax. And Seth, I

Matthias Miller  1:28:03
suspect because of how this interacts with the dealer portal, it's easier. I mean, theoretically we could do a list,

Unknown Speaker  1:28:09
but because of how interacts, it's easier to have a secondary checkbox. Cool. Well,

Matthias Miller  1:28:18
I mean, I think we oops. I think that means we have even bigger napkin back of the mat napkin thing for Josh, if we're set to go knockout that handles you stacks, good.

Speaker 3  1:28:35
So what is, I know we're right at 11. So with this design? What's time frame look like to have this done? Our next we would be paying sales tax again, October, throughout the 20th is that that would be great, but that's not far away. Is that what's realistic?

Speaker 2  1:29:02
It's that sounds fast to me, but, I mean, I I'm also just not quite sure what it'll actually take once I get into it, right? Maybe it's not that much. I don't know.

Matthias Miller  1:29:18
I would give it a 5050, chance if it were me

Unknown Speaker  1:29:22
putting, putting my normal time in.

Unknown Speaker  1:29:27
Well,

Unknown Speaker  1:29:31
I mean, going, what do we have been? Is it gonna Jane?

Matthias Miller  1:29:37
I don't think we really should plan on, I think we should plan on this being the project for October, and I think it's good discipline to pace yourselves. I mean, the option would be Seth going all in on at the beginning of the month, and putting in all his hours and taking off in the second half and working on other stuff. But. I really don't like that. I think we should have the discipline to pace ourselves. It's going to be a month, probably it'll give me time to he can pull me in. We can do it right. And if it's earlier than that, if we get through it in two weeks, everybody's going to be pleasantly surprised and happy. And you guys owe him a case of Mountain Dew or the beverage of his choice, and

Unknown Speaker  1:30:27
I'd be surprised if it comes through in two weeks. I

Unknown Speaker  1:30:32
don't know. Maybe

Matthias Miller  1:30:33
there's a lot of this is not there's a lot going on. There's an awful lot going on and and there's an awful lot of possibility for something that I just kind of hand waved my way across to actually be an issue. So true.

Speaker 3  1:30:50
Are you the only reason? Are you comfortable with? Okay, so let's say we do have this live in November. So now we're, we're we're cleaning up all the mess from so far this year, everything we've overpaid or should have paid didn't pay. And then we, you know, we encounter five different scenarios. We pay November, and then we to develop and to clean that up in December, like, as long as you're comfortable to with two periods to try and get 24 all cleaned up. I would say this, it's, it's the right thing to do.

Speaker 4  1:31:24
I mean, and you can always file an adjustment at the end of the year, if you want. You know, in January you can file an adjustment for 24 obviously, it's a lot nicer. We don't have to, but

Speaker 3  1:31:42
good. So, yeah, I think we'd be okay. The plan is to have this done by end of October, 1 week November, just kind of what I well, I mean, we, we technically would have until November. You won't use it until November 15 or so, but you'd probably try it out before then, just, but

Matthias Miller  1:32:04
we could update the test system, and you could, you can wreak whatever Havoc you went to over

Speaker 2  1:32:09
there. I say I'd love if that would this would get some sort of testing. Besides,

Unknown Speaker  1:32:17
don't mess up the current until we

Unknown Speaker  1:32:21
Yeah, well, but I mean,

Matthias Miller  1:32:22
the changes will be really isolated. If worse comes to worse, we can blow away the we don't really care what happens until we pay our first liability. We can blow blow away sales tax history and

Unknown Speaker  1:32:40
all kinds of stuff. So, so what?

Speaker 3  1:32:42
What date should we what is a target date like? Are you thinking November 10, just so we have something to

Matthias Miller  1:32:51
success? Would you be comfortable saying we'll have development done by end of October, and plan to have it live at the beginning of

Speaker 1  1:32:59
November? That update over that first weekend in November,

Unknown Speaker  1:33:05
I think so.

Unknown Speaker  1:33:08
Okay, now

Unknown Speaker  1:33:10
the other goal, the

Speaker 3  1:33:12
other question, um, well, okay, on that. I mean, if you need, if we, if you need more, if you need us to allocate more than our quote of what are we at? 18,000 per month in order to achieve this, then I can pursue that, see what we can do

Matthias Miller  1:33:36
sure

Speaker 2  1:33:38
I don't know offhand. I have a hard time. I tend to over judge projects. At the beginning, it looks bigger than it is usually. For me, I feel like someone's actually get into it. But then sometimes I'm it's just hard for me to judge how much work it'll take.

Speaker 3  1:33:58
Okay, well, if you run into situation where this turns into a bigger project, and you're, you know, your dad's saying you're at the quota that we've asked, reach out to us in the world. Sure. We'll try to,

Unknown Speaker  1:34:09
sounds good.

Matthias Miller  1:34:10
We can check in into it mid month, yeah, sure. That'll give a good sense. And if we need to scale up to get it done by the end of the month,

Unknown Speaker  1:34:20
we can talk about how that works. I

Speaker 2  1:34:22
have one or two questions on asset stuff, but I'm not sure we really have time to go through. I was reviewing with Joel, and not quite sure, trying to figure out how we go about this. But it was, some of it was the book value stuff. Some of it was the new report. We added.

Unknown Speaker  1:34:41
I can, I can keep going a bit. If Are you good to

Speaker 2  1:34:47
okay, then let me okay. Let's make sure my screen, I guess

Speaker 3  1:34:59
I. Think about doing a transaction.

Speaker 2  1:35:04
So we added a report. This report, which it might have changed a bit by now. What I'm unsure of is so this is the one that we linked to from the Asset Detail screen, and right now this only includes transaction rows to accounts that are linked to an asset. And I had asked you all about this, and I think drew you were saying it's to help make sure we don't have like, if you're setting up an setting up an Are you say you discovered an asset that you didn't have in the books yet, you would change an equity account as you're setting it up. What I'm not, what I don't, what Jill and I weren't sure about, is this is excluding any expense accounts because it's only type of asset which you all handle depreciation a little differently. But do you and these are never going to completely balance out which these numbers I feel like are, this still includes sales stuff. So that's why these are so drastically off. But, yeah, but is it for sure, what you're wanting that you don't include any expense accounts? I guess is what we're wondering.

Speaker 3  1:36:40
Well, can you even? Can you link any expense? Okay, you're saying you cannot link an invoice. Only invoice you can link is, is one that's in an asset account, is what you're saying.

Unknown Speaker  1:36:53
I believe so.

Speaker 4  1:36:58
I mean the transaction. I guess you might be able to but

Speaker 2  1:37:03
what are the can these not be expense accounts? Actually, right?

Unknown Speaker  1:37:12
The but

Matthias Miller  1:37:13
that's intended to be depreciation. So if you want depreciation showing in that report, depreciation is an expense account?

Unknown Speaker  1:37:21
Yeah, that's what. That's what I'm wondering about. It to me, it seems confusing. If

Unknown Speaker  1:37:28
depreciation is what you're saying, did the report be showing depreciation?

Speaker 2  1:37:35
Yes, basically, because right now it won't. And I find it confusing to say all transactions, and we're not actually showing all transactions that are linked to the asset

Speaker 3  1:37:46
end of the report. It's, it's basically to say, here's the book value, here's what we paid all in closing for this asset. So maybe we should, should we just rename the report?

Speaker 2  1:38:01
So I have have that option here with purchase trend, you can like this, and then that'll keep it to just, well, it should keep it to just the purchase transactions. Once we have handling for sale assets

Speaker 3  1:38:18
you're saying, then it would only show it would not show the credits, all these credits, when it was sold, and neither would it show the $150,000 sale.

Speaker 4  1:38:33
And then the all transaction would show depreciation. So from from the 150 there, down to the end of that section, that's all this for sale transaction. This

Speaker 2  1:38:45
here, yeah, yeah, see, okay, and we were working on handling, adding handling for sale transactions. But it was getting messy enough, so it was partially related to this, and I wanted to talk well, I looked at it with Joel, and I was wanting to talk with you almost before I actually before I actually committed the changes or sent them to you all. So basically, you want this report. Is it, if we're only showing what I'm wondering is, can we, when we say all transactions, can we literally just show all transaction lines linked to the asset, and then when we say purchase transactions, we can narrow it down to what we show in here,

Speaker 3  1:39:37
which, because I'd like here would be What the report we were just looking at, minus those, the sale and yes,

Speaker 2  1:39:45
and it would exclude, what I'm thinking is, if you click purchase transaction, transactions, then it would exclude any depreciation expenses, right?

Speaker 4  1:40:00
I think that would be, yeah, that sounds good, because the all transactions should balance out. Then, if you're exactly again and all those things, yeah, yeah, okay.

Unknown Speaker  1:40:13
Update report

Speaker 2  1:40:17
only include Wait,

Speaker 3  1:40:23
where we use that purchase transactions is, like for this house we're looking at, is okay, you know, mister, whoever responsible for that project, like, according to accounting, we have 190,000 is the cost incurred on this asset? Did we get everything? Was anything missing. And so he went through and said, Okay, here's one or two that do not belong here. Here's, you know, one or two that I know that for whatever reason got missed.

Speaker 2  1:40:54
Yeah, so I think I know how to move forward on this. So this is already in the live system, but I'll just change it a little bit, and then I think it'll be doing that. And then sale of assets. What we I was not sure how we should be handling abandoned and impaired assets, because on here, we have the option to create a new transaction for any of the above. But I'm wondering for you all, do we need to break out the sale into its own option and then that set we had talked about setting transaction type to a type of sale, then that would automatically be excluded from well, for sure, from here, from the book value is where you were wanting it.

Matthias Miller  1:41:49
But a sailor abandonment is effectively the same thing abandon. Abandoned just means there's no new owner. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:41:55
What's impairment? Then

Speaker 4  1:42:01
same thing. I mean, it's basically, it's an asset that's not doing us any good anymore.

Speaker 2  1:42:09
So those are all actually very similar, and they could all be treated as sales.

Speaker 4  1:42:15
The way I would see it is, is basically, instead of having a checking account line in the transaction we have, we have an expense line because we're just, we're saying this. We don't this thing doesn't work anymore. We're, we're just getting it out of our assets. This is going to cost us.

Speaker 3  1:42:31
And these would all go, whether it's a sale about abandonment or impairment. They would all go to the same account, right?

Speaker 4  1:42:41
I mean, they're they all make a change to that, whatever asset account they're in, yeah,

Speaker 3  1:42:46
they lower the asset account. But on the other side, they're all going to the same sale transaction or whatever account. Oh,

Speaker 4  1:42:54
or do you just Yeah, gain or loss in the sale? Yeah, right. Yeah. They'd all go there. That's where the loss would go. It's just the abandonment and impairment. You're not receiving any check to offset it, you know. So, so it's just a lot higher gain or loss.

Unknown Speaker  1:43:12
Gotcha. Okay,

Speaker 2  1:43:15
okay, I think Joel gave me other notes,

Unknown Speaker  1:43:19
unless you depreciate it more than that's for value.

Matthias Miller  1:43:25
Get rid of these assets. It's all right.

Speaker 2  1:43:28
I think that gives me what I need to move forward. Now my question is, what's the priority on this? I have it. I think I actually have it basically developed. It probably be an hour, two hours, to get it wrapped up. Now I think, should I go? I think it'd be good to just go ahead and knock it out. I don't want this floating around forever.

Unknown Speaker  1:43:50
I would agree. Okay, sounds good.

Speaker 2  1:43:52
So I'll try to knock that out today, and then I guess as far as other dev priority does is sales tax taking priority over all the other little things. Like, do you were wanting an activity history? Like, how much I guess? Well, I could still work in a few of those things on the side, sort of like I had been doing. But I think sales tax is probably needing, yeah, just,

Speaker 4  1:44:20
I'd say, just put it at the top of the paper cut projects. I mean, if that's what we're needing to resolve that issue anyway.

Unknown Speaker  1:44:26
I mean, assets, no

Speaker 2  1:44:30
activity history, like he was wanting, oh, Stripe, it's,

Unknown Speaker  1:44:34
it's, yeah, Sprite payment thing. But

Matthias Miller  1:44:36
the question is, do you, do you want to continue devoting 20% to paper cut projects this month? Or do you want it all to go to sales tax? I

Unknown Speaker  1:44:45
think that's your question. Seth, right,

Speaker 2  1:44:47
yeah. Or should it be like five or 10% if I just had a little bit of time to do something, should I or should I just straight up, just focus on sales tax completely?

Unknown Speaker  1:44:58
I don't know. I.

Speaker 3  1:44:59
I would, I would say just straight up focus on sales tax, with the exception of that activity history. Sure. Well,

Speaker 4  1:45:07
do we need the activity history in order to fix the issue of it? Of stripe running over it? No, okay. It's just a nice thing to

Speaker 2  1:45:18
have. Yeah. I mean, I can add it in five minutes, 10 minutes. Oh, okay,

Matthias Miller  1:45:25
it should be very fast. Then I guess, go ahead,

Speaker 4  1:45:32
just put it at the top of our of our paper cuts. And then once we go back to the paper cuts, we get it done. But sure,

Speaker 2  1:45:38
I think numbers one through three are done. And number four, number four, I have largely coded, but I haven't actually committed it that one I could wrap up if I have a bit of spare time. It's probably 20 minutes or something,

Matthias Miller  1:45:57
I would I would set if you've got that before you tear into sales tax, I would wrap up that one and wrap up, yeah, that's your asset stuff. Yeah, okay, I

Speaker 2  1:46:06
don't like having too many No, yeah, no, I'll be able to focus far better if I not.

Speaker 3  1:46:12
Okay, you're going to wrap up the activity history, the asset thing in the uncategorized Expense Report, yes, okay, and then I would focus solely on Yep, sales tax. Yep, good. Okay,

Speaker 2  1:46:28
that gets sorry. That took us over. No

Matthias Miller  1:46:31
worries. Seth, please use signal then to

Speaker 1  1:46:34
reach out to me if you've got sales tax issues. Sounds good. We had

Unknown Speaker  1:46:39
that one review Matthias then,

Unknown Speaker  1:46:44
yeah, let's do that. Let's I'll call you on the other zoom. Sure. Sounds good. Okay,

Speaker 3  1:46:53
another two, three minutes on something related to sales tax. Or are you so the other thing that with the sales tax is, can we create an import for sales orders for self storage? So well drew you go ahead and explain how them. So what's happening for the

Speaker 4  1:47:16
self storage units for ABC? We pull our sales numbers. We pull our deposit records from the other platform, and these are all for like the monthly rental fees. So in order to bring that stuff into our sales tax report, what I'm seeing is we need to create sales orders for them, which is a ton of a ton of entry, and we already have it in digital format. So can we create a sales order import?

Unknown Speaker  1:47:59
Yeah, and

Matthias Miller  1:48:03
the other platform always imports it on in a consistent format.

Unknown Speaker  1:48:07
Yeah. I mean, I believe so

Matthias Miller  1:48:10
the if you guys want to do some legwork that would make Seth's life, or whoever ends up doing it incredibly easy, I would create a new sales order and delineate line by line, what fields need to be set to what column,

Unknown Speaker  1:48:33
and I'm going to, I'm

Matthias Miller  1:48:34
assuming you're going to want a payment row. I mean, it's like, who's the dealer? Do you need a rep? You know, etc, etc, etc, the whole way the whole way down.

Speaker 3  1:48:53
So basically, manually create a sales order and assist all, and then have a, do the export have an Excel on the one side, and then off of that, manually create a sales order and assist and just reference the assist sales order to the correct column or information on the

Matthias Miller  1:49:17
Excel. Yeah, you I mean, you wouldn't have to actually save the sales order. Just outline exactly what, what needs to happen from what's in the spreadsheet, in the sales order,

Unknown Speaker  1:49:32
because we're we started importing payments,

Unknown Speaker  1:49:35
so just as transactions

Unknown Speaker  1:49:40
may as import So, right.

Speaker 4  1:49:45
So, I mean the other thing we could, we import that accrued liability from that, that transaction grades, part of it goes to accrued liability. So. We could continue to do something like that, if, if we pull from accounting for our sales tax report, but then

Matthias Miller  1:50:15
I would much rather, because of TaxJar and all those related everything. Really, really

Speaker 1  1:50:21
prefer creating sales orders for these versus

Speaker 4  1:50:27
then. Then step two is, can we? Can we do something similar for all the deposits? Because a lot of it just they give us a deposit report. And, you know, it's all just electronically handled, going straight to our deposits, you know, with their fees and stuff like that

Matthias Miller  1:50:48
those, is there a single deposit for? I mean, the answer is, it depends. Is the deposit total always the same as the sales orders are importing, or is there a linking between that we can do between the two.

Speaker 4  1:51:03
Um, I mean, maybe, well, is there a thing where we maybe need to marry our two reports before we do our upload,

Unknown Speaker  1:51:18
potentially,

Speaker 3  1:51:20
because we're if not, well, okay, now we're introducing AR. So sorry, tune. It's which are like,

Unknown Speaker  1:51:28
which essentially is what one day.

Speaker 3  1:51:32
Well, no, because sometimes they pay cash and it doesn't show up at Bank for like. Suddenly we now have these mixed in with AR. So fun stuff, but the management side of it is all done in some other software. So I think, I think we should marry our two reports together and off of that, create delineate the sales order, including the payment charge.

Matthias Miller  1:52:00
So if you would, if you would only import paid sales orders, then I

Speaker 1  1:52:06
don't know how you want to do it. Yeah, whatever. Um, but, but you

Matthias Miller  1:52:10
guys can figure out how you want to marry Marian payments and and deposit date and if all deposits, like, for example, if you add a column for deposit date and all deposits, all of these deposits,

Unknown Speaker  1:52:31
I'm thinking,

Speaker 3  1:52:33
I think a good point you're making Matthias is, I think the only sales orders we bring In are the ones where we actually have

Unknown Speaker  1:52:42
deposits for

Matthias Miller  1:52:47
the biggest issue is the deposit linking. So if they, if you can have the deposit, if you can have a system wide unique deposit reference number, and we'll need to know the account it got deposited into district and account, then we can have a single import create The deposits and link

Unknown Speaker  1:53:21
the sales orders to those deposits. These would be two separate uploads. We

Matthias Miller  1:53:27
do it in one, if you have a single spreadsheet that has and then put in the

Speaker 3  1:53:33
Yeah, creating sales orders, payments and

Unknown Speaker  1:53:39
deposits. Yep,

Unknown Speaker  1:53:43
like Josh would say, well, it should just work.

Matthias Miller  1:53:46
It should just work.
