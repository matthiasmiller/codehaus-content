Living Room, ladies, I just wanted to let you know about a really special celebration that's coming up on October 8. You are invited to join us for our one year anniversary. We are celebrating God's faithfulness in the past year and looking forward to many more years of his faithfulness come and enjoy good food, fellowship and a time of worship. We would love to see you there. It's at six o'clock at the steeple Event Center. Thank you. Bye.
