Okay, gotta go. Hey, ladies, we are having ours. What your celebration at The Living Room Tuesday, October the eighth, at six o'clock, there's gonna be good conversation, good food and worship. We would love to have you come and help us celebrate as we celebrate all that God has done this last year. Bye.
