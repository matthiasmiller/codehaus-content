Okay, so here's an interesting insight that regenerative organisms are less likely to have insert and are more likely to normalize cancer than other organisms. An interesting analogy and it does it two ways. One, it keeps the cancer cell connected to the rest of it to the rest of the soul to rest itself and it provides with it the motivation to move towards the common goal. Eliminate eliminate isolation, create a common goal and just relevant organizations, the relevant church context of what is the common goal which we're working towards, and what is the motivation that's not quite the right term. And how do we keep them connected and one of the reasons why when these things are disconnected, these are the two big pieces that I really bothered me. And this was what introduced answers. I guess it's also true within fitness if you want to kill cancer. In the business, you need to make sure people stay connected to each other To make sure that they remain motivated and directed towards the goal
