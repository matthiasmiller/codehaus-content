Matthias Miller  02:27
Question for you. While we wait for Tim to come on, have there been any recent threads common threads that you've seen in any of your sales calls with Ellis?

Matthias Miller  02:49
I would say probably the most common is just the fact that custom software isn't necessarily right for them. I think out of a lot of the most recent ones there's only been one maybe two. Since the beginning of March that I've been actually qualifying for custom software, everything else is something very simple that yeah, some simple spreadsheets or something like that could take care of their problem or Yeah, something like that. But there happens. Yeah. Thank you

Matthias Miller  04:13
What do you ask? We're needing to come up with some more ads. Gotcha. Yeah. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  04:27
Kind of looking through some of these notes to see what else there might be. You've never really run one from the well, sorry, let me back up a little anecdotally, based on conversation with a friend. He was looking at. Paying, I don't know, buying an industry specific software. We're actually not even specifically his industry adjacent to his industry shed software for a pole barn business and it was like it was gonna be several grand up front and I don't know 500 grand per month and he did some looking around and he can get clickup to do a lot of what he needs it to do for like $8 per user per month Gotcha. And he predominantly wanted it for workflow stuff. So yeah, actually one common theme I am still seeing I know it's something that we've advertised about in the past is I'd say most most of them have mentioned inventory management to some degree finding a way to deal with that better

Matthias Miller  06:08
yeah, I'd say probably at least two thirds of the calls we've had have mentioned inventory management despite the difference in industries that they are in

Matthias Miller  06:28
so I wonder if it makes sense to do if you do something targeting that's actually actually kind of interesting because that's not that dissimilar from what got the Amish like they got insight and and crew on board

Matthias Miller  07:14
another one that I've been noticing as I look deeper into notes is let me see here handful of them are also mentioning wanting to move on from QuickBooks into some other different accounting system.

Matthias Miller  08:28
That's helpful there's even a couple that Yeah. I mentioned having obviously with custom software you can have both inventory management and accounting in the same software but there's been a handful of them that have mentioned how nice would be to have those under the same roof instead of using QuickBooks for one and some other inventory management or another one yeah, those would probably be the two biggest common terms throughout that's helpful.

Matthias Miller  09:33
Inventory can eat so much cash so fast. Especially like there was one call we did we actually thought there would be a good fit for a custom software. And then they I just heard back from them earlier this I think it was yesterday I guess that they're going to put any kind of design on hold but they have a lot of metal For products and yeah it's practically impossible for them to keep up with inventory with the overturn that they have and their current like basic silly they might even use something just like Excel spreadsheets or something like that to try to track and just got such an overturn that it's almost impossible

Unknown Speaker  10:36
All right, I am here now

Matthias Miller  10:41
back yep we had a

Unknown Speaker  10:52
few things so kind of scrambles the day a little bit

Matthias Miller  11:04
yikes I fall asleep

Speaker 1  11:08
in my chair here and I don't know why. Well

Matthias Miller  11:14
you working from pursuit? No, I'm working from home. Oh, bummer. I was gonna say be like, well, we'll call pursuit somebody hunt you down. rattle your chair knock on the door

Unknown Speaker  11:31
it doesn't have to be nearly that that dramatic. You can just just just text Suzanne and she can come up and shake me awake. That's almost

Unknown Speaker  11:49
nearly excited. Exactly. No, I'm not that tight.

Matthias Miller  11:56
Yeah. Hopefully Hopefully there's a faster recovery.

Speaker 1  12:06
Yeah, she's she's sleeping now. You can sleep in for a few hours. So I think she's on the mend, or they want to keep some food and liquids down this morning. So

Matthias Miller  12:16
anyway, school screen share.

Speaker 1  12:28
So first off, I guess some excuse me some general CSS stuff. few items here.

Matthias Miller  12:48
And

Matthias Miller  12:56
that's wanting to discuss

Unknown Speaker  12:57
with ls Swanee to Z GA

Speaker 1  13:09
between a discuss priority for that. So maybe actually, that'll be we're gonna discuss priority first in our call this afternoon. And

Matthias Miller  13:21
I got a check in call and

Speaker 1  13:25
go from there with some of these other things. Client proposals that probably something to wait, wait a few weeks out when we prioritize these other actor designed and this is also something that's further out. So I guess not really. Anything that needs needs a lot of attention right now on the CSS side. Unless there's any. Yeah, any other projects? I guess like the fuse design, billing stuff and system setup stuff. Anything that we should discuss here as far as how to proceed with that? What?

Matthias Miller  14:12
I don't think I've got anything on that. Particular My plan is just starts tomorrow. And so we'll be doing some onboarding and I'm gonna try to block out large amounts of time to just go through my email together. And well, I mean, there's some basic tasks that need to be offloaded sooner rather than later. And then yeah, predominantly around meeting prep and other stuff, but circling through emails and catching up on I've just freely been loving things fall by the wayside in email, and mostly it's been kind of okay, but I know they're still Probably should be seeing after

Matthias Miller  15:10
all right

Unknown Speaker  15:18
then Is there anything

Unknown Speaker  15:18
from you like that you would need

Matthias Miller  15:23
generally for any of the projects we're working on? Ah

Matthias Miller  15:36
I don't think so.

Unknown Speaker  15:43
Okay.

Matthias Miller  15:45
I can't think of anything at this moment.

Speaker 1  15:49
Okay. Well, then we can hop into

Matthias Miller  15:54
some Mr. Just wanted to obtain there for anything else that would be needed.

Speaker 1  16:03
So some beers, and that is time tracking is Sony 721.

Speaker 1  16:22
So Matthias, we had a call with a client today,

Matthias Miller  16:27
he brought on the guy who is

Unknown Speaker  16:29
one is focusing on the Salesforce side of things

Matthias Miller  16:33
and talked with him for

Speaker 1  16:38
he was on for 20 minutes or so half an hour. So my assessment of this of things is that they would be best served by bringing their CRM in house to app hosting, because most of the stuff that they're tracking in Salesforce is being duplicated

Matthias Miller  17:06
here in the the members portal.

Speaker 1  17:10
And a few things that that aren't being tracked here, I think would be fairly easy to add

Unknown Speaker  17:24
that's

Speaker 1  17:24
that's just my assessment might. So they had been attracted to Salesforce because there was an offer of like, they could have 10 free seats since they weren't nonprofit. So they said that that was a big attraction there. They were here.

Matthias Miller  17:45
So let me so they

Speaker 1  17:51
Yeah, they're currently using it for for CRM. Tracking new leads, tracking members tracking growth rings, tracking who is paid. And then they have a spork scorecard. Like a weekly scorecard of new leads new members, and different

Matthias Miller  18:10
points like that. They're currently

Speaker 1  18:15
using QuickBooks for invoicing and payment processing. So they already have two different systems going on here. Long term they would have been would envision integrating QuickBooks and Salesforce. They're not using Salesforce for for mass emails, but would be looking to again, longer term. So if we keep Salesforce, we're going to have three programs at play, Salesforce, QuickBooks and app hosting.

Matthias Miller  18:46
And it'd be kind of end up being a bit of a

Speaker 1  18:55
probably a Triangle of Death. But where they would see quick Salesforce as being the sort of the source of truth for leads. And then app hosting is being a source of truth for members, and QuickBooks being where the financials happen invoicing and payment processing. And so then app posting would be would be, we'd have an integration with with Salesforce on one side and QuickBooks on the other side. So that's, that's kind of what it would look like. I don't know that Salesforce and QuickBooks would need to talk to each other at that point. But Steve, the guy that's handling Salesforce, mainly right now. He's already he's been putting time into getting Salesforce setup, and customizations and whatnot. But he's already dealing with the headache of data in multiple places between QuickBooks and Salesforce and spreadsheets. And that data not lining up

Matthias Miller  20:00
uptrend and whatnot. And he's,

Speaker 1  20:04
he's okay with the idea of moving away from Swift, Salesforce moving CRM into into App hosting.

Matthias Miller  20:11
Okay. I think, Okay,

Speaker 1  20:15
sounds like he's Yeah, he's open to that. And he's put time into Salesforce but

Matthias Miller  20:20
he's not.

Speaker 1  20:22
He's not holding on to that because he sees value can see value and in dropping that

Matthias Miller  20:27
Well, I mean, we could give him we given sales opportunities that they wanted

Matthias Miller  20:43
which might not be a bad way to go. And then basically app hosting becomes the core and

Matthias Miller  21:01
and then pushing billing information to QuickBooks at some point and then pushing some kind of segmentation, you know, email list and segmentation out to whatever email marketing system they use.

Matthias Miller  21:21
And if they want to keep using HubSpot for email marketing, I don't know that that's a problem. Although at the point that they're no longer relying on those customizations. I don't really know what's what's holding them to that?

Matthias Miller  22:13
Yeah, at this point, they're

Unknown Speaker  22:14
not using anything for

Matthias Miller  22:16
for mass email.

Unknown Speaker  22:21
So they don't even have anything set up for that. But I'm guessing some of that could even be done. From from App hosting as well, like the pillars does?

Matthias Miller  22:38
Yeah, I mean, it depends a little bit if it's going to if it's members, I'm, I'm fine with that. If it's going to lead, so I'd be I push for something besides that. Just because of

Speaker 1  22:55
that, because of like data modeling stuff, or more, because of no, it's reality stuff.

Matthias Miller  23:03
Yeah, I mean, like unsubscribe links, and well, subscription management, email, even, even just email deliverability. Those platforms are focused on email, deliverability. And then other types of tracking to click, click and open tracking etc. If you're doing any kind of marketing, or if you're doing more than just basic level marketing, you're going to want that.

Speaker 1  24:00
You have any thoughts on what the cost would be for this is really rough numbers, but

Matthias Miller  24:11
for adding

Speaker 1  24:14
what the cost would be for adding some features to finit to fill out the CRM side of things for the one app hosting versus integration with Salesforce. Like what kinds of things we're adding, if we're adding, say, half a dozen dozen fields to couple different records and

Unknown Speaker  24:35
adding

Unknown Speaker  24:38
say, two to four to six reports

Matthias Miller  24:45
to app hosting,

Speaker 1  24:47
versus building out integration to sync members and and to sync multiple record types.

Matthias Miller  24:59
I'm gonna I'm gonna guess so rough rough sounds like I'm a barking dog rough rough rough estimate. We had a conversation recently about this with Eugene gene one of the auric brothers and basically he said you get about the same amount of money doing an integration between third party systems as you do like you get a lot more money into integrate integrating multiple systems than you think you do. And I think I think this is a case where

Matthias Miller  25:43
keys were what it's probably cheaper to add fields and reports to are about the same less headache hassle. Add reports that that now I'm still gonna push that you don't want to put email marketing into into App hosting, but I would I would think in terms of complexity, complexity, manageability it's going to be better putting it in a single consolidated system.

Matthias Miller  26:50
One thing that one of the guys mentioned

Speaker 1  26:56
was that even when it comes down to training in new users or training new people if you have you don't have as many pieces of software to manage. Very true.

Unknown Speaker  27:11
Definitely benefit so I like how they seem to be thinking they're not

Speaker 1  27:18
they're not locked into tightly to how they've been doing things but also they've only been doing things for two years or less.

Matthias Miller  27:30
But they're thinking yeah, they're willing to think openly. Yep. So okay,

Speaker 1  27:44
well we'll plan to follow up with that is there anything else that you would say as far as things that you'd suggest that we communicate with them regarding what you have very little context you you're welcome to go back and watch the part of recording that we we talked about with them if you want to see more of what they're what they're tracking and whatnot but anything else that you would want to see or anything else that you would say push that

Matthias Miller  28:15
email list plus segments to a third party service segments do you miss segments? Segments just means well do you want your customers in it Do you want your prospects new we're at this seminar right

Unknown Speaker  29:06
Okay

Matthias Miller  29:27
sounds good

Unknown Speaker  29:28
now

Matthias Miller  29:37
hmm

Speaker 1  29:40
yeah, this is actually a general question but for the time tracking incident, we don't have a number of target hours set

Speaker 1  29:54
I just put in I think it has put in 120 which is because What DBS was or it's less than one EBS was it can be as close to 200 I

Matthias Miller  30:05
think swollen

Matthias Miller  30:18
Yeah 190 Nice

Unknown Speaker  30:25
Do you have any any thoughts or what you'd want

Matthias Miller  30:30
to get I mean

Speaker 1  30:31
shot in the dark because these are so notice in that designs relatively speaking

Matthias Miller  30:42
yeah I don't really have anything

Matthias Miller  30:53
no I don't really know all right

Unknown Speaker  31:10
all right

Unknown Speaker  31:16
so maybe this would be actually better save till we have things settled on the Salesforce side of things

Speaker 1  31:31
so we know where to go with that so disregard that first one this one here do they want regional reps to create user profiles they said they want the Super Admin and regional reps to be able to create user profiles

Speaker 1  31:46
but not facilitators so this goes into the the topic that we were talking about the other day when we wrapped up about about permissions and impersonation and whatnot

Unknown Speaker  32:07
so

Unknown Speaker  32:13
I guess for this right now, do we just put in

Matthias Miller  32:20
as a regional rep

Matthias Miller  32:38
Well, this would be user profiles as an admin everything super admin

Unknown Speaker  33:05
okay

Speaker 1  33:09
is this something that you want to discuss more here at this point what is or would it be what's the best way to I'm really not familiar with this format how to structure it how to spec it out when not

Matthias Miller  33:23
what would be the best way to proceed with that

Matthias Miller  33:35
well, so

Speaker 1  33:36
today isn't a good time to discuss it like we want to do other more interesting things today we can do that too.

Matthias Miller  33:45
Let's see if we can get something down

Matthias Miller  33:59
just like scrolling

Matthias Miller  34:13
we have somewhere

Matthias Miller  34:25
policy one.

Matthias Miller  34:40
So

Matthias Miller  34:51
contact goals meetings groups.

Matthias Miller  35:34
think the best way to communicate this

Unknown Speaker  36:11
Wow

Matthias Miller  37:19
Try not to make it sound too much like Amway?

Matthias Miller  39:30
Well in meetings depends on whether it's an industry meeting or now that is an industry meeting okay so this would be a

Matthias Miller  39:54
are the goals on the

Speaker 1  39:57
no the goals there you The graduating goals have their own records

Speaker 1  40:22
you can edit these that would be presumably just the admin possibly the regional reps we haven't talked about that well maybe it is on the record you can leave those yeah but to do for those?

Matthias Miller  42:24
I think you can probably actually archive most of my other comments besides the table I think the table gets pretty close to

Matthias Miller  42:37
this we could add this yet

Matthias Miller  43:23
there is no upline for regional rep

Matthias Miller  43:30
right I mean other than

Speaker 1  43:34
admin but it's not that's not really a direct it's

Matthias Miller  43:37
not like it's not like you have Right exactly. It's not like admin one is responsible for three regional reps and admin twos responsible for another one

Unknown Speaker  43:46
as far as I know it's yeah

Matthias Miller  43:51
so I think I think my comments and you can okay

Unknown Speaker  43:59
cool and so what would be the

Unknown Speaker  44:12
so it's not really using permissions it's using other

Matthias Miller  44:19
what is the what's the

Unknown Speaker  44:20
term that you use to describe this?

Matthias Miller  44:32
mean it's data restrictions and abilities and record editability what we're doing what we're controlling

Speaker 1  44:57
Okay, now that's probably all I need. Just curious what another different angles for doing all this stuff. So with with EBS we were using tons of permissions. Yes, taking a different angle.

Matthias Miller  45:21
Right. And that's because it's hierarchical in nature. Right.

Unknown Speaker  45:36
So my name is going to carry this out and

Matthias Miller  45:44
read this out.

Speaker 1  45:50
And your note here about adding fielding for facilitator regional rep, is that on the contact type record? Oh, well,

Matthias Miller  46:01
why wouldn't we actually put that on the growth ring? Who's the regional rep for the growth ring?

Speaker 1  46:08
Yeah, and that's, I guess, we had asked how they wanted to do that. He kind of like to, to do it by region, or they have a region so I guess you'd have like your growth rate would be a member of region and then the region would have a regional rep. I feel like that's getting a little more complicated than needed.

Matthias Miller  46:33
But maybe the regional rep could have a

Unknown Speaker  46:37
reason name on his contact record

Matthias Miller  46:42
or something like that.

Unknown Speaker  46:46
But what is your thought on the data model for that? Well,

Matthias Miller  46:48
you got a regional rep for multiple regions theoretically. True. I think I mean, I think it's is another record type but I think it's a reasonable data model I think it makes sense yeah.

Unknown Speaker  47:00
The model is reality.

Matthias Miller  47:04
They are thinking about you know I don't know the Delmarva group for example. Or whatever they end up calling these things

Speaker 1  47:36
and then probably the best thing would it be best to have a region field on the growth ring record so that we assign from the growth ring record? Yep. Okay.

Matthias Miller  48:28
So then,

Speaker 1  48:30
just making sure we think have all this stuff filtered up through the start at the bottom the member

Matthias Miller  48:37
he is. He is the

Speaker 1  48:43
downline of a facilitator by virtue of being a member of the group. The facilitator is facilitator of and then the facilitators a downline of the regional rep by virtue of being a member of providing being a facilitator of

Unknown Speaker  49:04
the group that the regional rep is the rep for. So it all is it's all centered around the groups

Matthias Miller  49:19
all right.

Speaker 1  49:31
And actually, what we should do is region droplist and

Matthias Miller  49:42
regional wrap

Unknown Speaker  49:50
so that you can if a rep is rep of multiple groups, it'll show operate? Okay. Cool. And then on the contact type, is there any special fielding that we need on the contact type?

Matthias Miller  50:19
To handle this? I guess we should think through the relationship with this to contact types. Can we just make everybody be a Member? Member

Unknown Speaker  50:34
user, you mean user profile?

Matthias Miller  50:37
No contact type of member, I mean, what's really the difference between

Unknown Speaker  50:54
you probably want to be able to see where people are at.

Unknown Speaker  51:02
Like,

Matthias Miller  51:05
well, I guess we could just have,

Speaker 1  51:06
we could maybe add a macro to show their, their user group on the contact record or something because you'd probably want to be able to see

Unknown Speaker  51:13
in the member directory, you're gonna be able to see, okay, this guy is regional rep for the Marta region, or this guy is facilitator for a group.

Matthias Miller  51:31
You want to see the roll, I guess what I'm saying

Speaker 1  51:34
when they're gonna be when they do the comments and whatnot.

Matthias Miller  51:40
So this person is, has the following roles for the following groups. It's, it's a, either a bottom report or a virtual RG. Because they may be, they could be a member of one region, facilitator of a second region, and a regional rep of a third. Like, let's say that the Western group meets virtually by zoom, and they don't have anybody in there who's been a member previously. So this guy becomes a facilitator for them, to get them off the ground. He's regional of his group, and more likely than he's going to be a member of a local group, but still don't think you can pin these down to just one

Unknown Speaker  52:34
right through Drew.

Matthias Miller  52:45
So would there not be

Speaker 1  52:48
your thinking it would, there wouldn't necessarily be a place to assign their role, it just they would receive their role by virtue of he's a facilitator because he's set as facilitator on a group.

Matthias Miller  53:03
Yeah, I see. Yeah. And maybe you would have a type then for Super Admin. Well, I don't know though, because.

Matthias Miller  53:44
Think what you might then do is actually have a permission to say basically, create a super admin permission.

Matthias Miller  54:02
Not not perfectly symbol

Matthias Miller  54:14
might be good enough. Don't

Speaker 1  54:17
buy a second, just have two user groups. I think you've already talked about that at one point. I mean, just two user groups.

Matthias Miller  54:25
You would have three user groups, one super admins, two regional reps, and three members.

Unknown Speaker  54:46
And

Matthias Miller  54:52
I guess you could even call it facilitators members.

Matthias Miller  55:01
And then we would have to we would use the can manage other users or whatever it is permission that we already have that would be granted to Super Admin and regional rep and then we'd have another one called can view and edit all community all growth rings or something like that

Matthias Miller  55:47
regional Reber has the

Matthias Miller  55:54
heads candidate user groups permission as well

Unknown Speaker  55:58
okay

Matthias Miller  56:13
okay I think contact types would just be member

Speaker 1  56:23
and a member or the rent have a

Matthias Miller  56:28
something organization

Unknown Speaker  56:41
like that and then probably other

Matthias Miller  56:47
what would members organization be

Speaker 1  56:51
that would be like tracking the business so, I remember growth ring there'll be a contact for me individual contact within there also your contact for good house unless we just want to feel that on

Matthias Miller  57:10
on the record,

Unknown Speaker  57:11
maybe the simple list or something contact

Matthias Miller  57:13
record for the individual.

Speaker 1  57:16
But my thought was to record for them that for those so they can then

Matthias Miller  57:22
you know, if there are five

Speaker 1  57:27
employees of code house that are part of growth rings, they can pull report and they can see who all these people are connected with. And the doubler was he was liking the idea of being able to actually wasn't getting into another topic, but being able to link an individual with multiple organizations. So, if someone's a, you know, they're an employee of this company, but they're also involved with this this nonprofit or whatever, you want to track that as well. That affiliation

Matthias Miller  57:57
was that Sure? Yeah, being able to track that affiliation makes sense. So whether that's

Speaker 1  58:08
on our G on the record and not worrying about contact records for all the organizations or whether we do use contact

Matthias Miller  58:14
organizations, sometimes we can discuss

Speaker 1  58:18
you along but I guess what I'm seeing is that contact type isn't really going to matter too much. For for this whole hierarchy thing. It's gonna be based more on the user group

Matthias Miller  58:33
Well, it's based a little bit on the user group and then predominantly based on growth ring definitions

Matthias Miller  58:45
I mean, even the even the member designation, I mean the member designation might be nice. So you know which member needs to become part of the growth ring or not, but even that one's not that relevant

Matthias Miller  59:16
Okay.

Matthias Miller  59:31
Cool I feel like that has a lot of

Unknown Speaker  59:40
clarity to.

Matthias Miller  59:51
Now, that complexity there

Unknown Speaker  1:00:08
All right

Matthias Miller  1:00:11
excellent use notifications

Speaker 1  1:00:20
what is the best way to spec out? Well, I guess we actually nevermind. Maybe we don't need that question. We'd have some snippets for those we're deferring some of the notifications for later and

Matthias Miller  1:00:34
yeah specking out some of the other ones here where are we building this out as a somewhat generic methodology?

Unknown Speaker  1:00:44
I did see this note down here that yeah, that each user can can configure whether we see them as

Matthias Miller  1:00:52
system navigation or

Speaker 1  1:00:54
email or both is that something like is that reasonably simple to to do at this point? Is that it was as it was included in the high level design so we can be going with

Matthias Miller  1:01:09
it if so then I guess we'll scroll down a little bit

Matthias Miller  1:01:41
probably conversation for Alice is what he wants to maintain on the development side I would use this in zfp If I had it

Unknown Speaker  1:01:56
okay.

Unknown Speaker  1:02:25
Okay

Speaker 1  1:02:45
so we'd have a simple list of industries is it fairly simple to validate against deleting simple list items that have been used

Matthias Miller  1:02:58
or that are being used? I believe so. Let me just confer fields we have a

Matthias Miller  1:03:15
stunning

Matthias Miller  1:03:41
get some of the levels

Unknown Speaker  1:04:02
delete is referenced

Matthias Miller  1:04:10
we can but it does have to be a lookup level and it doesn't have to be able to get level with anything more than just a field but it does have to be a lookup level in order to do that

Unknown Speaker  1:04:21
okay

Matthias Miller  1:04:41
and in the spec, you should tell them what error message they should show if somebody tries to delete it and it's referenced in the database Okay,

Speaker 1  1:05:16
and rough thoughts on what what would the time difference be or development time difference be on doing this as a simple list versus this customer look at blah

Matthias Miller  1:05:27
blah blah hours okay think I mean they wouldn't even have to recreate reports where if you don't want to just it's literally saying this is this is a look. Yeah, like it's barely even a couple of I don't know it's just not

Matthias Miller  1:06:04
okay

Unknown Speaker  1:06:12
so then the same question

Matthias Miller  1:06:17
was for

Speaker 1  1:06:20
development resource categories list which I already had a question here whether it's we'll look up I don't know exactly why I was wondering that

Matthias Miller  1:06:34
but it probably should be probably with some reason

Unknown Speaker  1:06:42
remember

Matthias Miller  1:07:01
right.

Speaker 1  1:07:04
Contact types, how do we determine which if any of the contact types should be shipped

Matthias Miller  1:07:13
which should be

Speaker 1  1:07:15
set up in the in the live system maintained there?

Matthias Miller  1:07:23
Well, let me clarify something shipped means. Okay, there's, there's kind of like three levels. One is it's just created in the user system. Two is we add the item, but we don't set any fields. And that is what we call what we used to call investor tool zone. I don't know what we call it now. And then internally, we use the term shipped for where we're pushing a specific set of data but the user can change it and then for us because I forgot there's also a we're pushing a specific set of data and you can't change it once it gets in your system and so we're just talking about so we should somewhere clarify or terminology for that because those are specifically different things. Okay, sure. And I don't I would be surprised if we actually literally ship any data with ship records let's take a look ship records app posting settings is fields No we do not ship any date no contact type ship data. Yes. Can edit ship data is true. So where do we do shipped records

Matthias Miller  1:09:15
we did turn on ship data for them. Or was it for SFB zt a number of things sorry for you EVs. I mean there's there's actually quite a few that ship thinking that ship contact types. And so, okay, base basically. So basically, we don't want to Well, we don't want to do is say that a certain record type is shipped in some situations, some systems but not others. That gets confusing. And so predominantly, when we ship record types we want the wanted to always work the same In this case contact types are shipped but people can edit them based on respective permissions

Matthias Miller  1:10:16
and so then the question is how do we know whether we should set it up in the client system or we should set it up in this system? My rule of thumb is does it control behavior in any way? And if so, we should for sure, have it be as a predefined type or list item? If not, then it really is a bit of an I mean that's a technical requirement first of all if not then it's kind of up in the air I mean Yeah not really helpful is it so in this case

Unknown Speaker  1:11:11
up here in permissions we were saying that the contact type really has no bearing on

Matthias Miller  1:11:21
on the permission so to speak. So it really doesn't

Speaker 1  1:11:28
probably doesn't really matter um the only thing would be that we want we would want to have the Member Type be used for members and we would have on the contact record a section that is specific to

Matthias Miller  1:11:51
to contacts with the member of

Matthias Miller  1:11:57
my mates it would probably make sense to I mean, in that case, if we're basing it based on the Member Type I'm gonna assume we have validation that it must be a member type for it to be a facilitator regional rep or member

Unknown Speaker  1:12:18
we would yeah we would need that

Unknown Speaker  1:12:35
let's make a note here for that

Matthias Miller  1:13:00
okay,

Speaker 1  1:13:02
so then we would say the contact type rep record is I mean the member

Matthias Miller  1:13:07
contact type record

Matthias Miller  1:13:15
is the one that we shift or yeah and I think and I think it would go ahead and ship the business one too okay.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:02
Okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:14:04
sounds good

Speaker 1  1:14:11
knowledge tree entry category record. So for their key points that they get from reading a book or from a seminar, whatever, have ways to categorize them. The plan was to have a category and then a subcategory to put them on the knowledge tree.

Matthias Miller  1:14:39
So

Speaker 1  1:14:43
first question here on the category or one master list of categories with visibility restricted to the linked members. So, for example, is this one my right and thinking that there could be 1000 of these records but But if I'm only a member I can just I can only see the ones that are have my name on them

Matthias Miller  1:15:21
right okay

Unknown Speaker  1:15:32
so that's yeah

Matthias Miller  1:15:35
well you say one master list of categories no if let's say everybody comes get five categories well you get five I get five Ben gets five there's 15 categories categories in the system

Speaker 1  1:15:53
but they're all technically on the same same lists are like I mean it's not a list it's a lookup but it's all

Matthias Miller  1:16:02
I don't even know that it's actually maybe it is getting right into silica yeah, there's there's a st there's a shared underlying list you can only see list items for the ones that you created

Speaker 1  1:16:34
Okay, sounds good. And they would have a, an ID

Speaker 1  1:16:47
it would be the unique identifier. And then

Unknown Speaker  1:16:54
yeah, that's fine

Speaker 1  1:17:01
then here for the member for setting these up. We would for the members who don't have internet access, if they're if their stuff is being handled by their facilitator, then their facilitator would need to be able to set this correct for them set them up for them so if it's just a member

Matthias Miller  1:17:35
so for standard members

Speaker 1  1:17:36
this is going to be auto set and read only before defaulting the user or their I guess their contact name for the current user for others this is editable

Matthias Miller  1:18:01
and they can might actually

Speaker 1  1:18:06
default to blank or should it still default to the current current user? No It should default to blank I guess

Matthias Miller  1:18:17
well yeah sure

Matthias Miller  1:18:26
technically drop with some downline members

Unknown Speaker  1:18:34
yes

Unknown Speaker  1:18:45
all right

Unknown Speaker  1:18:53
okay, that's actually answered by the downlines thing

Speaker 1  1:19:10
and then the client would like us to be able to start out the each member start out with some items defaulted. So when someone signs up as a member, we go ahead and set

Matthias Miller  1:19:25
up set up

Speaker 1  1:19:30
a list of items for them. And this would correspond to the list of development resource categories

Matthias Miller  1:19:39
over here and then the member

Speaker 1  1:19:43
could that way he has something to start with. He's coming on board as Okay. says to start from scratch with his list well, then

Matthias Miller  1:19:56
think be harder. So what Why wouldn't we have whatever

Speaker 1  1:20:02
the existing development resource category items are and give him give him that as a starter this year

Matthias Miller  1:20:09
go ahead when you enter the knowledge tree record if the category list is blank then show an X 30 button that says add default categories

Matthias Miller  1:20:30
Now isn't this phase two as well

Matthias Miller  1:20:41
the discussion

Speaker 1  1:20:45
this would be on the development resource no the knowledge free entry the entry would be would be part of Phase One

Matthias Miller  1:20:57
so they can go and start

Speaker 1  1:21:01
you know documenting these things even before they have the full fledged knowledge tree so that's yeah it would be something there in phase one

Matthias Miller  1:21:15
so

Unknown Speaker  1:21:19
category

Unknown Speaker  1:21:26
entry Yeah

Speaker 1  1:21:58
And would this be able to look at this would be able to look at the other list and bring in bring a copy of each active list item

Matthias Miller  1:22:17
yeah yeah

Unknown Speaker  1:22:31
okay, cool so it doesn't do it automatically but it

Matthias Miller  1:22:41
will give them an easy way to do it. Yeah. Sounds good.

Speaker 1  1:22:51
Okay, okay, subcategory we've been talking, the plan was of category and then subcategory, and then you would have, you'd be able to do all that special categorization and stuff. The client said the other day that if it's easier, he's fine with not having subcategories and they will just have to manage everything from the category and if they want to break things down by subcategory they can just do it in their in their title for the for the main category does that does that make things significantly simpler? As far as not needing to have two separate lists and time together and all of that?

Matthias Miller  1:23:38
Yes, it does. Okay, if he's making that He's opening his mouth for that I would jump on board before he can retract it

Unknown Speaker  1:24:01
all right

Speaker 1  1:24:09
so then what I'm going to do if he's assuming he's okay with that then we'll then we'll want to follow up on making sure that our description because we are going to be adding the you're gonna He's gonna you're gonna set the category or subcategory name and then the description was going to be auto set based on that with categories subcategories anyway, we might have to might want to revisit that

Speaker 1  1:24:57
all right, and then on tax record, I guess I should say Are you guys good to keep going? Do

Unknown Speaker  1:25:03
you need a bathroom break or go bang your head against the wall to clear it out break?

Matthias Miller  1:25:10
I could use a quick restroom break.

Unknown Speaker  1:25:13
Okay, go fill up my water

Matthias Miller  1:25:17
didn't break my helmet so I'm not ready to bang my head against the wall.

Unknown Speaker  1:25:22
You're not that hard headed with bias.

Matthias Miller  1:25:27
You act surprised him. I'm ducking out before I can hear another word

Matthias Miller  1:25:37
All right. All right.

Matthias Miller  1:30:24
Oh Right

Unknown Speaker  1:30:37
Okay, contacts and that question about

Matthias Miller  1:30:41
organizations

Speaker 1  1:30:47
thoughts Matthias, on what's gonna be the best approach on this? Looks like our new contacts only allows one organization to have individual old contacts allowed multiple organizations per individual like you said multiple organizations on the

Matthias Miller  1:31:04
contact record do we

Unknown Speaker  1:31:10
do we want to

Matthias Miller  1:31:15
a basis reefs saying that first of all, for saying what? That only allows one linking? Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:31:32
Oh, actually, that's just as the

Matthias Miller  1:31:36
old contacts still

Unknown Speaker  1:31:46
so the organization field is just a refresh.

Matthias Miller  1:32:00
That's not fair. I don't know if we want it on in this test system or not. But

Matthias Miller  1:32:12
I mean, I'm a fast coder. What can I say?

Unknown Speaker  1:32:16
Yeah, really? Nice. Automation become a bias.

Matthias Miller  1:32:22
Automation. Exactly. Who needs a is that on a t shirt? My goodness?

Matthias Miller  1:32:44
Is that as system switch? Yeah, that's a system switch. I see. sure to turn back off them or not?

Speaker 1  1:33:02
Yeah, you're going to turn it back off. That's a really valuable feature to know about.

Matthias Miller  1:33:14
Okay, well, it's

Speaker 1  1:33:15
if it senses that super easy then.

Speaker 1  1:33:25
Yeah, then we might as well just use the contacts, use new contacts with organizations and turn that switch on for them

Matthias Miller  1:33:34
and call it good. Yeah. Cool.

Speaker 1  1:33:47
All right, then there's no further high level design. There's regarding whether we should track both individuals and organizations, which we are at this point, I can say there is no that said that if yes, then this might be a place where you can contact types. Anyway, just wondering if that note if those comments there. Every 1417 are worth anything at this point. There's anything we should do to follow up on those.

Matthias Miller  1:34:18
Your perspective

Speaker 1  1:34:23
it looks like those are all being covered, all that stuff is being covered elsewhere.

Matthias Miller  1:34:35
Sure, if we're,

Unknown Speaker  1:34:36
if we're validating that

Matthias Miller  1:34:37
only individuals can be members, which I'm assuming we want to be. Yeah, I mean, there's much else required here.

Matthias Miller  1:35:11
right

Speaker 1  1:35:13
where would be the best one the best way to validate that only individuals can be members simply by controlling the list of available names on the on the group record to just be the Member Type contacts

Matthias Miller  1:35:51
yeah probably that's probably fine and or just a warning on save

Matthias Miller  1:36:02
only and possibly a warning on save if they're not members

Unknown Speaker  1:36:13
as a

Unknown Speaker  1:36:16
just make foolproof you mean

Matthias Miller  1:36:20
yeah

Matthias Miller  1:36:32
okay

Unknown Speaker  1:36:33
so group record members names

Speaker 1  1:37:17
and can we yeah so this would be actually should be all remember type contexts with an active membership and I'll need to need to spec out a little bit more here

Matthias Miller  1:38:04
okay

Unknown Speaker  1:38:05
so continuing on contact record

Speaker 1  1:38:15
user photo what would be what are the specs that we need for this for displaying and for uploading

Matthias Miller  1:38:34
user photo I think we're basically going to have a paragraph here where I had some kind of brainy idea about how to make this work

Matthias Miller  1:38:54
Yep, two paragraphs actually

Matthias Miller  1:39:21
like my proposal number two from from a simplicity standpoint and so I think I don't know how you want to document it in spec it out

Matthias Miller  1:39:47
okay,

Speaker 1  1:39:48
sure, so we have a read only user photo memo okay. And then they will editable memo and then does the finalized photo button only appear when there's something in that editable Mo

Matthias Miller  1:40:07
Yeah

Matthias Miller  1:40:17
Okay

Speaker 1  1:40:26
And could this all be could this all be done behind like a button like a child screen

Unknown Speaker  1:40:34
we just have a button on the know below the the user photo to the right of the user photo for

Unknown Speaker  1:40:44
add photo

Speaker 1  1:40:48
edit for her something like that. And then you click the button it opens a child screen that has the editable memo and the label and the finalized photo button.

Matthias Miller  1:40:56
Probably yeah. And I wonder if we don't want to

Matthias Miller  1:41:09
Yeah, as long as we can do Yeah, I think it's your right we want that. Okay. Now the other thing we could do is hang on scroll down we could have a an edit button that hides the read only shows the editable one tells him to insert in the field below and then you have a potential you know, finalize or cancel or undo where you wouldn't open a child screen

Matthias Miller  1:41:56
which is easier to developments in plein.

Matthias Miller  1:42:07
Air their child's screen probably because you don't have to think about editability or visibility swapping it's probably not a huge difference but

Unknown Speaker  1:42:21
Okay.

Matthias Miller  1:42:23
Am I okay, now let's take one step back. Can we simplify this even further?

Matthias Miller  1:42:48
Because we need the exact same mechanism for uploading is it just there's just this in development resources right.

Speaker 1  1:42:56
At this point I could see that maybe eventually like investment opportunities it's a piece of real estate or something like that. images but I don't think we have any anything set for that.

Speaker 1  1:45:38
So is that you do good with that Yep

Matthias Miller  1:45:54
and then

Unknown Speaker  1:45:55
clicking finalized photo

Speaker 1  1:46:03
basically runs the process to push the photo over into the read only memo and does that we need to specify whether or not it's going to auto close the child screen that

Matthias Miller  1:46:17
can't that's the downside of the child screen is that you can't really okay I think it'd be fine

Speaker 1  1:46:27
it's not something that would be done frequently unless somebody's really using this as their social media platform

Matthias Miller  1:46:38
updating profile picture every three weeks

Speaker 1  1:46:47
with is we've got potential here for a social media platform for the conservative

Matthias Miller  1:46:55
app this accessible by fax there's the guy who wants to do that that Matthew Gingrich guy wants to do that by voice basically. I see almost like a chat line except it's it's like a boxer slash yeah wow, that's interesting

Matthias Miller  1:47:26
yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:47:58
Okay, I like it.

Speaker 1  1:48:04
Okay, next question here. Should we have a checkbox on the contact record in the member details to specify whether the member is an online member or not? And that would control whether they would have a user profile linked to them and whether a warning shows if their user profile if there is no user profile, links to the

Matthias Miller  1:48:28
contact and whatnot that can make sense okay.

Matthias Miller  1:48:45
All right.

Speaker 1  1:48:50
Salesforce, actually that's ending what happens next there. regional reps I don't think we need this because we're tracking groups

Matthias Miller  1:49:06
separately.

Speaker 1  1:49:10
The only thing would be whether we want to show on the show on the contact rather record you know, who their facilitator for and who their regional rep for but that's a question for the client Yeah.

Speaker 1  1:49:54
All right. Life vision section We would have just instructions from posting settings and then a memo for the division to certain extent we want to have it required for them to set it up we don't because they actually get points if they do the scoring system they could get points for starting to set up and so maybe we just leave that allow that to be optional because it could be kind of complicated to figure out when how to make it required

Matthias Miller  1:50:45
I mean I think we could just warning unsafe that might be that it's encouraging yeah ever that's encouraged

Matthias Miller  1:51:23
all right, and then it's

Speaker 1  1:51:30
okay for their goals their annual goals this is that

Matthias Miller  1:51:36
fancy

Unknown Speaker  1:51:38
RG stuff going on

Matthias Miller  1:51:43
where

Speaker 1  1:51:45
it says here each row appears a screen on screen a set of fields with the option to cycle through the different years anyway, all these goals here would be clean text the client said this is often one to two sentences. Can we do multi line plain text on an RG like that we have to hide them hide that behind buttons are nice to not have to not force them to take one or two sentences on a single line

Matthias Miller  1:52:24
Yeah, we can't we can use an emoji multilane emergency and if they edit it in the RG itself it might delete them accidentally delete linebreaks but there's nothing that we would do it as an energy field

Unknown Speaker  1:52:46
on the on the contact record itself

Matthias Miller  1:52:52
sorry hang on this would be a

Speaker 1  1:52:55
this I think this would be akin to the what we've got here for the address

Matthias Miller  1:53:01
were you would

Speaker 1  1:53:03
you be able to see the fields on screen and then you could cycle through the years

Matthias Miller  1:53:16
yeah, we can do we could have made for example we could have made address multi line and then if you drill into the RG this example then it would have looked a little funny and if depending how you edited it in the RG you might have lost her new line but we can Okay sure. So

Unknown Speaker  1:53:46
right here

Matthias Miller  1:53:58
so we would your goals instructions

Speaker 1  1:54:07
other goals and then should we have this view you all and and new buttons as well like we do for the address

Matthias Miller  1:54:22
prompt yes mostly everything so.

Unknown Speaker  1:54:44
Okay

Unknown Speaker  1:54:51
and this

Speaker 1  1:54:52
is also pending Salesforce discussion, one way on that and

Matthias Miller  1:55:04
a few minutes left.

Speaker 1  1:55:11
Oh, yes, on the growth ring group record. We have the RG for the group for the group members. And then we're going to have a separate field for, for facilitator. Do we need a separate field to sink to designate a facilitator? Or can we just add a column to the RG for facilitator?

Unknown Speaker  1:55:43
Sorry, when

Matthias Miller  1:55:49
I don't know that I have a huge problem with having a checkbox you validate. But there's only that there's always, always exactly when

Speaker 1  1:56:00
would that cause what I'm thinking about now is would that cause any problems with the whole thing of permissions and tracking? Is it cleaner to be able to track facilitator based on a field on the record rather than feeling the energy?

Matthias Miller  1:56:23
Our facilitators do facilitators operate? Well, yeah, I guess in some senses, they sense they do. Sometimes they don't, I mean, it's just a matter of how it's fielded. And presumably, we'll have some some kind of macro and the growth ring that lets us hold the facilitator name. So I mean.

Matthias Miller  1:56:51
Having a little hard time caring how we do it? Okay,

Speaker 1  1:56:56
yeah, if it doesn't make that much difference, I was just thinking they wanted the, this RG sorted by with the facilitator first, and then by the group members in state. So, one advantage having a checkbox would be that it would like that's really,

Matthias Miller  1:57:14
really easy. Right? I'm fine with that. Okay.

Matthias Miller  1:57:32
And then the first

Speaker 1  1:57:33
there was a facilitator section that was only visible for the facilitator and their uplines with the transfer facilitator button, that password list of members and all of that, does it need to be that complicated or can we just say that

Matthias Miller  1:57:52
it's a matter of

Unknown Speaker  1:57:55
changing the checkbox on the ergy?

Matthias Miller  1:58:09
Was thinking it has to update other fields somewhere but maybe that's not the case. And if that's not the case, it probably is that simple

Unknown Speaker  1:58:25
don't think it needs to update any other fields

Matthias Miller  1:58:34
good with simple

Matthias Miller  1:58:42
unless it comes to waking you up from falling asleep at the keyboard?

Matthias Miller  1:59:35
Okay, well I think that do it for now. Okay. Cool.

Speaker 1  1:59:47
We had the question of whether we needed the call on Thursday

Unknown Speaker  1:59:54
afternoon.

Speaker 1  1:59:56
So at this point, we have a number Have two dues for you. But let's go through quite a few today already might have more few by that point. So I think if you're available for that still, we could probably we could shorten it

Matthias Miller  2:00:17
by half an hour, we could

Speaker 1  2:00:21
skip that CSS that half hour CSS call, it's on there. I do everything that hour and a half instead of two hours of

Matthias Miller  2:00:32
that'd be helpful for you would and we can also move it earlier if you want that I can join any earlier than 30. Thursday

Matthias Miller  2:00:56
I would prefer that it makes a huge difference

Matthias Miller  2:01:12
Yeah, I mean, I would I would say if we if we Yeah, I was if we only need an hour and a half. Let's see what we have there. Okay.

Matthias Miller  2:01:36
All right. We'll plan on that

Unknown Speaker  2:01:44
sounds good. Anything else before we sign off?

Matthias Miller  2:01:47
Not here. I don't think so.

Unknown Speaker  2:01:53
Don't be cool. Thanks. Very good. Yep. Thank you. No later
