Matthias Miller  00:54
Hello, you'd be here. You could be trudging through slushy snow and ice. Wow.

Speaker 1  01:03
Sounds feeling I think I'll take care. It's, I think it's getting up to almost 50 today, and it's like sunny and pretty enough, it's a little different. Oh, never mind. It doesn't get to 50 today. It's only up to 35 cooler day, but it's, it's still sunny and not, yeah, not slushy.

Matthias Miller  01:31
Well, here's, here's my I was thinking briefly about it. Here's my immediate answer. Do we have everything in the December section in product changes and accounted for in a project management report. And can we, at some point, rip through those and figure out what's, what's, what are we stuck on?

Speaker 1  02:00
I know for me, a lot of what I'm stuck on is trying to it's calculations and the logic for adding event rows, and I just keep getting stuck going in circles between that and sales tax and all those things, how they play into each other.

Unknown Speaker  02:18
So do we need

Matthias Miller  02:20
to block out some time to to work on it together.

Speaker 1  02:25
I think it would be helpful, okay? And it wouldn't. It wouldn't shock me if we get to it and we can cut through a lot of the hate in my head and okay, it's actually not that much left, right? It's just getting to all be a muddled mess in my head. I'm not quite sure how to push through it. Okay.

Matthias Miller  02:42
Well, let's, let's do this right now. Let's make a list of everything that you and I should theoretically be that's hanging over our heads. So it's, is it just refunds, or is it so zero? T refunds? For sure. Is it sales tax as well? Or is the sales tax part of that? Or is it

Unknown Speaker  03:14
separate to think little,

Unknown Speaker  03:19
it refunds like I haven't touched

Unknown Speaker  03:22
Okay, sales tax

Unknown Speaker  03:26
may be part of that.

Speaker 2  03:35
Okay? Um,

Matthias Miller  03:46
and then we have the clicker report for

Unknown Speaker  03:53
zfp, for zfp,

Matthias Miller  03:56
yeah, we have the investor tools make sure that meeting comes around too fast. I feel like I'm gonna it's good, otherwise it would get dropped. But yeah, I would. So that guy, we got to get ready for. Yeah, there's, I thought there was something with there's something you messaged me about this week on CFP as well. That was we needed to take a look at.

Unknown Speaker  04:31
Had asked about

Matthias Miller  04:35
the warning we have. Yeah, that we

Unknown Speaker  04:37
resolved. I ended up just,

Speaker 1  04:41
well, we're doing warnings for imports and errors for other stuff.

Unknown Speaker  04:46
Okay, if there was one,

Speaker 1  04:49
oh, what was it? Mark was saying that it wasn't working for him, and I realized, Oh, they're using a Modify button, which ignores warnings. Oh, yeah. Okay, so I changed that to an error, but kept it as a warning for imports so that we don't break imports.

Matthias Miller  05:08
Okay, makes sense. We're good on that the we have transaction errors that aren't showing up for them, and that's probably something I could chase as well, but can we at least put it on the list? Yeah, what else is there? I did a bunch of cash flows cleanup. I'm still not super happy, but I hate having cloned income statement reports. They're awful.

Unknown Speaker  05:40
Where do we have that? One for,

Matthias Miller  05:44
one for insight, we have one for and then codecrafters one as well. They're multi category thing, trying to think,

Unknown Speaker  06:01
it feels to me like there's still, maybe it's not have a

Speaker 3  06:07
Little bit of cash flow stuff doesn't involve you. I

Matthias Miller  06:28
is that it? I think there's some to do Seth stuff in zrt, we should at least. That probably requires some design, yeah, okay, so that's the those are the loose ends, yeah. I think the other question that I would ask, which is kind of sort of outside of my jurisdiction, but is, what would be the one? What would be the thing that would have the greatest ripple effect, for example, if you went and, I mean, one of the things we used to do way back in the day was Ellis would sometimes just disappear from the office and go work at a coffee shop, or go work from home, or just somewhere, turn off his phone or IMV link, really, and just get through some stuff. Is there a version of that that would help your sanity?

Speaker 1  07:37
I've been doing a bit of work from home that's been more just the relaxing get knock out a CLS, a bit of CLS stuff, because I'm tired of RTO calculations. Yep. So that's helped some. I think what I'm running into is that I get bogged down in all the details and nuance, that just gets stuck, okay?

Matthias Miller  08:06
Well, I would suggest that tomorrow, I've got a I've got a dev priorities assist. Dev priorities call in the morning. I think it should be done. Let me actually see probably done by about

Unknown Speaker  08:22
i Oh, I don't know.

Matthias Miller  08:25
Done by supposed to be done by 830 Central, okay, or Done, done before that by 815 so if you're we could do what is, let's do 815 Central and hit the calculation stuff, and then investor tools is really as a Death March deadline, not, I mean, not quite, but you got to get that done and see, see where We're at with that.

Speaker 1  09:00
I think we have a call at normally have a nine or we have our monthly team call at 930 tomorrow morning for 45 minutes.

Matthias Miller  09:13
Would you rather? Would you rather 930 1030 would you rather just start it at 1030

Speaker 1  09:25
I mean, I'd be, I wonder if we can start earlier, but I'd have to drop so it'd be, we'd have, like, a 45 minute, hour long break in there. I don't know how that works for you.

Matthias Miller  09:35
I'll make it work. I got Stephanie this. I'll make it work. Okay, all right, so this is let's do. This does make sense to you to start with calcs when we're freshest,

Unknown Speaker  09:47
I think. So, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  09:50
so let's do we'll see how far we get.

Matthias Miller  09:57
And then 1030 Be, I don't know, we won't be able to go we do another 90 minutes after that. Maybe, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  10:08
CLS in that part. Probably, yep.

Unknown Speaker  10:12
So this is CLS, plus

Matthias Miller  10:20
I've got stuff I was trying to get done this week in additional lists that haven't yet. We'll see how that lands.

Speaker 3  10:32
Let's do this guy. It's a project I can move in there, and that's going to be my day, because from two to three, we've got,

Matthias Miller  10:48
yeah, and then I need to extend this event, because we always do follow up after, which is good, but it's not accounted for on My Calendar. Yeah. Okay, all right, is

Speaker 3  11:01
that helpful? Yes, thank you. Yep, you're welcome. We'll talk tomorrow.

Unknown Speaker  11:07
Hey, yep, sounds good. Yeah, yeah.
