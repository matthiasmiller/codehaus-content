Unknown Speaker  01:48
Zoom keeps crashing, not

Unknown Speaker  01:53
hearing anything, but might be on my end.

Matthias Miller  01:59
There we go. Oh, nice. It's my weird boom. Problem.

Unknown Speaker  02:11
Okay, I'll just share screen.

Unknown Speaker  02:18
I'm just stacking up random questions.

Matthias Miller  02:23
Wait, I love random questions. They're my favorite.

Speaker 1  02:27
Yeah, so the first one I'm trying to figure out, what is our depreciation model, is that? How? Where's the fielding and all that, I'm a little confused. Talk about it needing to be fielded on the rental company, right? Is that still correct?

Matthias Miller  02:48
Yes. Here, hang on. Sorry, one, one thing I

Speaker 1  03:14
Okay. Currently, we store settings on the product record, which I'm guessing is not right, but I don't know.

Matthias Miller  03:23
Well, we need to freeze the model on the on the record, so the base, the basic idea is you can configure it in some capacity. Okay, there are different ways of calculating depreciation straight line. And then the maker models. Maker models basically being accelerated depreciation with various forms of acceleration and so on the on the RTO company, you can specify what method you're using for. We're ignoring tax purposes for now. So which model we're using, straight line or maker effectively, and whether you're using a and especially which term lengths, and then further, which term links are available, as in, do you always match the contract term length? Or do you allow something whereby you specify early, you know, like fixed, three, year, five year, etc?

Matthias Miller  04:41
And so we're changing product to an asset. We have a type of a rentable structure, rentable other or a non rentable asset, okay? Which means. It basically, it's for sale, probably, or it's some other actually, it might be some other asset that you've got

Speaker 1  05:09
that you just appreciate, right for your winning track. Yeah. Okay, yep.

Matthias Miller  05:13
So then you have depreciation start date, the schedule, which is the schedules from the RTO company where it's based on depreciation method, dash, we would freeze the we would then freeze based on what the open contract is what the if it's based on term length, freeze somehow, what the contract term length actually is okay.

Speaker 1  05:52
So depreciation needs to be when does depreciation get set up

Matthias Miller  05:57
contract entry, and

Unknown Speaker  06:01
so we're going to assume it's linked to a contract at that point.

Matthias Miller  06:06
Well, there's a little bit of chicken and egg problem. I'm assuming. I was wondering, because you're going to create the contract, well, you're going to create, yeah, you have

Speaker 1  06:14
to create the first product on the contract, and then then come back and do depreciation, right?

Speaker 2  06:25
Oh, that's ugly. Yeah, it's really nasty. I almost

Matthias Miller  06:32
wonder if we could get away with asking, in the short term, just asking, what the what the term length is. I

Unknown Speaker  06:50
Hmm, what should it look like

Speaker 1  06:54
on the I guess, asset, but right now, I mean, obviously this guy disappears for now because we're not doing X, but we cache start date and book schedule,

Matthias Miller  07:13
right and and useful life in Months.

Speaker 1  07:18
Oh, that's if Wait, where is that? Well, I mean, I think it's

Unknown Speaker  07:54
in field.

Unknown Speaker  08:01
So we show this the start date and the schedule. What is this based on what's the helper list?

Matthias Miller  08:18
Help really should be theoretically coming off the RTO company, although, no, it's not, it's just made up.

Speaker 1  08:26
It's very made up right now. Okay, that makes sense. Okay, so this stuff actually stays pretty much how it is, except the helper list needs to be updated to look at the rental company.

Unknown Speaker  08:43
Yep, okay, well, that's that's handy, high tax fields for now, update book, schedule, helper list to look at the rental company.

Speaker 1  09:06
This stuff. I'm guessing this stuff was just manually plopped in with something,

Matthias Miller  09:13
yeah, with the next 30

Unknown Speaker  09:14
are we when are we adding?

Matthias Miller  09:20
So what we've Yeah, what we thought would be easiest would be to have macros. That's basically say, given these input parameters in the start date, what are the depreciation? What is it full depreciation schedule, A to Z, because you're gonna have to handle weird, weird stuff like rounding and other stuff like that.

Unknown Speaker  09:41
Yeah. Um,

Matthias Miller  09:48
and so, sorry, where was it going with that? And then we plot that all into a hidden RG, and only show them things as they come, be as they come. Current, unless they want to view for future,

Matthias Miller  10:07
or something along those lines.

Speaker 1  10:11
Okay, so we actually cash it the whole way out, right at the beginning.

Matthias Miller  10:17
Well, that was my thought. But so what happens? Basically, would need to go ahead,

Speaker 1  10:24
someone goes and changes the purchase amount. I mean, I guess that's a We should be just locking that down after, I don't know when,

Matthias Miller  10:36
well, yeah, or we need to freeze the I mean, I don't know the depreciation purchase amount, good depreciation value, yeah, I would think we're gonna Oh, because

Speaker 1  10:52
oh is what happened. It happens, if a building's retrieved, does depreciation stay as it was? Well, this taken down.

Matthias Miller  11:04
Different companies treat it different ways. Some will pause depreciation while it's not rented, but we're not going to think about it at this point. Okay, so,

Speaker 1  11:22
basically, what we need to do, we need to add field into the rental company, and we need to update this helper list. We probably need to cash a depreciation amount

Matthias Miller  11:40
that sound right? It's probably, that's probably right, yeah.

Speaker 1  11:49
I guess it'd be fair to show it from show it on the detail screen, if it's different in the purchase amount. Does that sound right? Yeah.

Speaker 2  12:01
Show it on the details. It's different.

Speaker 2  12:13
You do additions. Who can add it? Um,

Matthias Miller  12:25
and technically, if you control all your input parameters,

Matthias Miller  12:34
we wouldn't absolutely need to cache it's not like maker algorithm changes, sure, but

Speaker 1  12:47
it feels like something you do want to actually field it, though or not.

Matthias Miller  12:52
I would. I personally think it, it's it's easier to manage if you

Speaker 1  12:57
do exactly otherwise, someone tweaks something, and then you're like, Well, you have to take your activity history to see what the ballot settings were, and then

Matthias Miller  13:06
figure out what changed it. Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1  13:10
So how do we think, do we lock down book schedule after the start date? Probably yes,

Matthias Miller  13:20
with some kind of to do permission of, you know, wording or shooting yourself in the foot. We don't, I mean, you might be completely screwing stuff up, yeah.

Matthias Miller  13:35
Okay, I think if you regenerate past that point, we just rely on lock period handling for the accounting side, and their tax accountant suffers on the tax side.

Speaker 1  13:57
Okay, so I'm trying to, I think I'm going to hand this guy off to Nick then.

Speaker 1  14:08
Are we sure yet which way we're going on? I think we should cash the amount. But at what point do you cash the depreciation details? Is that or, sorry, the like the RG. Do you wait until the start date? Or do you just re if it's if the book schedule changes? Do you rewrite the RG? Or how do you handle that? I

Matthias Miller  14:43
Well, it depends what your study. I mean is that you can technically change the appreciation schedule up until you know whatever date their schedule is like, if it's the last day of the month, etc. Oh. Um, in some ways, what would make sense would be to freeze it on the first run, first time we run depreciation.

Unknown Speaker  15:10
What's our process for running depreciation?

Matthias Miller  15:13
Exactly scheduled task. Well, actually, no, not necessarily. There's really nothing that's required to run it. That's the thing. Yeah, if we're cashing it, then accounting impact just picks it up. Future, yep, as soon as the day hits,

Speaker 1  15:45
I mean, is it safe to say we just have an on change, on book schedule that rewrites the RG,

Matthias Miller  15:57
I think it's fine. It doesn't handle contract length, that's the

Matthias Miller  16:10
thing here. Let's do this.

Unknown Speaker  16:19
Dwayne mean,

Matthias Miller  16:26
well, I'm almost inclined not to handle, not to support contract length at this point or or to not make it automatic.

Speaker 2  16:43
But again, I feel like I should probably

Matthias Miller  16:50
ring doing it in some capacity before we just go off and do it.

Matthias Miller  16:59
Hey, but okay, but what's the what's the irreversible consequence of forcing people to manually enter the contract length?

Unknown Speaker  17:11
It's just a bit of pain. But that's fine.

Matthias Miller  17:15
I would be inclined to do that and added to do IDD for, you know, January or whatever, to automatically assign contract length. I mean, couldn't you solve this partially with a prompt? I mean, wouldn't, don't we actually want this upfront anyway, where you

Speaker 1  17:44
are you're saying when you set up a contract, yeah, entry process, you say you have an ask prompt saying, what are what terms are you going for? Yes. Are there times that they start setting up a contract and they look at the numbers for 36 months and they say, No, I've learned. And the clients like, no, I'd rather do it for eight months.

Matthias Miller  18:03
No, not at this point. They haven't. They have an eight contract.

Speaker 1  18:08
Okay, so we're not, at this point having a calculator to show them something like that where they preview it with the customer.

Matthias Miller  18:19
No, okay, this is all post sign, okay,

Speaker 1  18:23
how I'm assuming pre sign will be sometime in the future. So it seems the thing we'd want to do, but maybe not, or is that really not where we're adding value at all?

Matthias Miller  18:35
I mean, theoretically, there's a world in which we could, yeah, send out payment links and all this stuff.

Matthias Miller  18:52
But even there, you don't really, well, do you have to create the

Unknown Speaker  19:04
if we're not doing it right now, then I don't think I care.

Matthias Miller  19:12
You know, again, like there's this thing of technical debt versus what scope creep, whatever. But, yeah, exactly,

Matthias Miller  19:29
I feel like this is something.

Matthias Miller  19:40
Well, even, even if

Matthias Miller  19:57
you would do this, we have a separate way of previewing. And then a different way to say, Go finalize, or, you know, go generate a contract for this and go, I don't know. I just don't think we just put a to do in the January spec to populate the, populate the contract terms, and let's just add a field for now where it gets inputted that way.

Unknown Speaker  20:36
This is depreciation.

Speaker 2  20:57
On Film the turn likes during contract entry, do IDD,

Speaker 2  21:17
yep, how? Have a field store. What do we wonder if we have?

Speaker 2  21:35
Right now? Okay, we store, depreciation, method, type, year.

Speaker 1  21:52
But we're not taking account into account term lengths at all. Right now, are we?

Matthias Miller  21:57
We're doing, we're doing, we're not doing any, any calculations anywhere for depreciation, besides my x 30, my one off, yeah, ad hoc X 30.

Unknown Speaker  22:13
Okay, what's the year about?

Matthias Miller  22:20
I don't know why it's as like this seemed

Speaker 1  22:25
that maybe this is just out of date, and I need to just spec how it should change.

Matthias Miller  22:30
It's, it's, I'm assuming somebody meant youthful life in number of years, and somebody meant, thought it meant 2025, instead of two. Probably by the way, the sav value should be salvage value. I know I I've seen that a few times and greatly enjoyed it, and so I didn't change it. Okay, fine.

Speaker 1  22:55
Oh, this is funny, Jonathan. Jonathan sits, like next to me, or like the next desk over, and he was asking me some question, and I was paying attention to him, and then I glanced over my screen and just saw a sad value and just lost it.

Matthias Miller  23:12
That's awesome, man.

Speaker 1  23:18
Okay, well, I have enough that I can dig back into this and try to spec it out for Nick to work on. I think I'll probably get lost again, because it feels mildly confusing, but I have a I have a lot better picture. So products, products everywhere, should be renamed to asset. Is that right? Or how do we think about like, when you're on a contract, do you see, do we label as the asset you're linked to? Kind

Matthias Miller  23:57
of feels like a decision that was made in I mean, the short answer is yes, that's what doing, doing agreed to. I think you could revisit that question. It's, it's the kind of thing that's like, Wait, are you sure? Yeah, because on contracts now we're going to be calling them assets. And, I mean, but in a lot of ways, it makes sense to track these as assets, because that's what they are in real life.

Unknown Speaker  24:23
Is that how the RTO space thinks about them?

Matthias Miller  24:29
That's not, I mean, it's just a building like, what else would you call it?

Unknown Speaker  24:32
Yeah,

Matthias Miller  24:37
or structure. Are

Speaker 1  24:38
they going to roll their eyes when they open this like they go to the report and they see, they go to their a contract, they see the asset it's linked

Unknown Speaker  24:56
to. Maybe we don't care.

Matthias Miller  25:03
Mean, I mean, you could call it the rentable asset, if you wanted to. That helps a little bit. Maybe

Speaker 1  25:12
I'm just scared we're gonna get a little too much, like some of the weird names, or names that at least feel weird to folks in the industry,

Matthias Miller  25:25
we can defer it. There's not much cost in deferring it. I mean, should we

Unknown Speaker  25:33
go ahead to type, Change Type? Yeah, that we want to do.

Matthias Miller  25:43
Yeah, right? So, yeah, I think so.

Speaker 2  25:55
Contracts will now show they are like, concern is.

Speaker 2  26:13
My concern is that the terminology will be foreign for folks, maybe at your space.

Speaker 1  26:27
I guess we'll see if he wants it then sure. I mean, it's his product, yeah, it's his asset, really. Okay, so that's depreciation. I'll push ahead, and I may have to ping you again tomorrow or something, okay, but I have enough. I can be pushing it at Nick how are we thinking of sales tax? How does that work? For the first release,

Matthias Miller  27:01
I think it was in a manual entry somewhere of some kind, okay,

Speaker 1  27:05
but what sort of manual entry do we add the full RG

Matthias Miller  27:10
we would I think what you would do is have something like current tax rate on the contract, okay, and then copy it into each row on the RG and still handle everything.

Unknown Speaker  27:29
Okay? Well,

Matthias Miller  27:31
I guess technically we wouldn't have to, but I feel like there's no reason not to handle the full sales tax the rest of the way through, unless there's a scoping issue or a prioritization

Speaker 1  27:41
issue? No, I don't think it's a big deal. So you're thinking, do we break it apart? I think I'd ask you in you said we would break it apart by jurisdiction?

Matthias Miller  27:54
Yeah, it'd be, it'd be state, county, city and other and each one has a jurisdiction, rate, just like, just like, sales orders.

Speaker 1  28:04
So for now, we'll have fielding like that. We're not going to ping correct, okay, and then we cash, we cash that in the events. RG, are you thinking we also cash that in a tax history. RG,

Matthias Miller  28:21
I think so. I mean, I think we do something along the lines of psi for re implementing this all over again. But well, just,

Speaker 1  28:39
please don't tell me we're going to try to try to deal with bad debt and sales tax, and maybe we are,

Matthias Miller  28:47
I think, I think most of this can be done. I mean, I kind of feel like I don't even know that we need tax history rows. I think it could be done with a fancy report with repeat for list that's basically what is, what are all the jurisdictions and rates we've paid for or that we've that we've ever used? What do we currently owe? I mean, this sounds very familiar, what have we what do we currently owe? What have we paid in the past? And what's the delta? And push that onto a bill?

Speaker 1  29:35
So you're thinking, we don't, we don't cash tax history on the on track the way we have

Matthias Miller  29:43
on sales orders, I don't know, unless we should for transparency and troubleshooting.

Speaker 1  29:49
I think that's why we did it on sales orders, isn't it? Yes, I would. I feel like that. That's going to be cleaner. Rather than having the complexity being when we create a bill,

Matthias Miller  30:05
can we can? Or should we can? Or should we do that on Save

Unknown Speaker  30:15
the sales tax history row, yeah, possibly.

Speaker 1  30:22
How big is it? Is that going to start making save on old contracts? Slow?

Unknown Speaker  30:32
Probably not bad at this point.

Matthias Miller  30:36
Doesn't seem like it should not be that much. Yeah,

Speaker 1  30:40
so basically you would on save, you would run through the events, RG and look at the incurred rows. Wait, do you just look at incurred? How does that work?

Matthias Miller  30:56
Presumably, forgiven would also need to be accounted for, forgiveness, basically bad debt and some capacity.

Matthias Miller  31:12
I mean, I think it's, it's most fundamentally, it's go through your go find all it's just the logic that I described. Go find all the go find all the jurisdictions. Find out what the history total is. Find out what the current total is. If there's a delta, record it and then record the tax amount based on and record tax amounts based on delta of the tax amount got the percentage on the difference. So

Speaker 1  32:11
Okay, do we ever have scenarios where jurisdiction what happens if we incur a payment or, yeah, we incur a rental fee, and they don't pay it for two months, and then they pay it and like they've moved or something. Does that affect us in any way?

Matthias Miller  32:39
Well, I think the short answer is that you're thinking like the kind of question mark would ask, not the kind of question most of these people would ask. Is there a world in which this could matter? Yes. Is there a world in which we might have to back, date and change historical jurisdiction? Yes. Do we need to handle that now? No. Can Dwayne go create a editable report to go fix it if he needs to? Yes, yeah. Or, can somebody mainly copy paste a million rows in the back, in the history, in the events?

Speaker 2  33:18
Yes? Yeah.

Matthias Miller  33:23
Okay, this is probably also a horrible idea, actually, when it comes to implementation for this, having a temporary

Unknown Speaker  33:40
field, that

Matthias Miller  33:48
that stomps all the, all the, all the contents into a tab delimited list and then a repeater G that copies it out into the appropriate columns could be useful you

Speaker 1  34:05
think you're thinking from the events, RG, to the tax history.

Matthias Miller  34:07
RG, yeah, or you, or you create a, or you create a. I don't know if field chain exertions allow us to use string tables, either or detail variables, but either field or a detailed variable, they don't so you use a temporary field, yeah, you set the field with a string table run through. I mean, you could just build a string table set into a temporary field, then do a filler G from pipe list on all the columns, and then delete the temporary field. Right?

Speaker 1  34:46
But wait, we don't want to do filler T from pipeless, do we? Or unless you're built, unless the stream table you're building took into account the, I guess the prior rows. Never mind. Yeah, I did talk my question through to.

Matthias Miller  35:01
Know the answer. It's really whatever you like best to Yeah, the string table approach actually makes it very debuggable. Yeah,

Speaker 1  35:17
I'm thinking this is a Sean add the tax history, RG, and add fields to events. RG, and then I wonder if I want to do some of the Delta stuff, like the calculations, just because I've done it in in CFP already. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  35:39
either you were Nick, but probably it would make sense happy to have you do it.

Matthias Miller  35:52
I mean, it's actually not one. Once you use that approach, it's like, get the string table for the RG, for the existing RG, go get all the jurisdictions. Breach church and remove duplicates. Breach jurisdiction. Do the sums. If it has any non zero values,

Speaker 1  36:11
keep it. Yeah, it's not that bad. Yeah, no, I think I could have Nick do that part. Sweet. Okay. Okay, well, these are, I think these are two of the bigger, or at least the more complex pieces that we're just sitting that we need to make some progress on. And I keep idealizing making con making progress on calculations, and I keep doing more other things, not development so, but

Unknown Speaker  36:46
this can do that.

Matthias Miller  36:48
Is there any concern from your end, Dwayne's a little white. Dwayne feels very nervous about not having his head wrapped around the project better. There's nothing that you guys are working on that's not really critical, is there?

Speaker 1  37:08
I mean, I don't think so. Mean, we're working on whiskey. We're working on the stuff that are for December. Yeah. And I mean, I keep throwing Sean some small cleanup things as well that we wouldn't be absolute must haves, but they're sort of thing he takes 30 minutes and knocks out. And we have that we're going to want anyway, like report aspects and stuff. So I don't mean

Matthias Miller  37:40
it feels to me, Dwayne's used to spending so much time in design, and feels like making so much progress that now that it shifted so heavily from designed execution, that I think we can clarify things and such. But I think it's partially just a discomfort because he feels out of touch. Gotcha. I really don't think

Speaker 1  38:03
we're working on anything that's not prioritized this December. Yeah, we're pretty buckled down on that. I mean, if he's too concerned, I could literally just send him a or if he's curious, we can send him the breakdown, time breakdown, and he could see which pieces we're working on, I

Matthias Miller  38:25
don't think so. I'll work with him on it, and we'll go, Yeah, awesome. Thanks, sir. Yep, thank you. Oh, did you want to? Did you want to get like, I know you want to leave or something, yeah, I

Speaker 1  38:43
mean, I'm planning on working another 45 minutes.

Matthias Miller  38:46
Probably, well, I mean, I can work until I can work another 20 probably, actually, okay.

Speaker 1  38:53
Should we try to make surprises, some of the CFP stuff? Yep, their appetite is nuts. I emailed him midweek last week and said, Hey, we're code crashes at like, 1.5x in normal monthly budget. And he said, Just keep going, and let's go spend money. Told him, like, well, Matthias is also working on cash flows, and Josh has an invoice coming in soon. And I told him that beforehand. He's still like, yeah, just keep going. Chipper.

Matthias Miller  39:24
Sure. We'll do it. It might the speaker might turn off in January, but, you know,

Speaker 1  39:30
it probably will. But then we can focus on RTO, yeah, exactly. Okay.

Matthias Miller  39:37
So is straight payouts the biggest? Okay, on the notch a thing, yes, isn't. Maybe I'm just okay. There's a, like, a finalized date and the like, when did we finalize it? When? When? What are we telling the bank? I. Yeah, to me, maybe I'm thinking about this wrong.

Speaker 1  40:06
So we have a creation date. We have create creation date and effective entry date. Those are two dates that I know of. Effective entry date is today, plus one business day from when you market ready to export, we don't really have a date other than that.

Matthias Miller  40:29
So export, we don't have an export date.

Unknown Speaker  40:35
Well, that was what I was just wondering about. Assistance. Assist.

Speaker 1  40:57
Ready for does this get? March mark, notcha, file ready to export. I think, I think we use a status.

Unknown Speaker  41:17
Yeah, don't wait. Yeah, we're just using a status. We don't have a date.

Matthias Miller  41:28
Why wouldn't we? I mean, I mean, we could, I

Unknown Speaker  41:38
don't know. What are

Matthias Miller  41:39
the different angles. What are the status? What status do we have right now?

Speaker 1  41:48
Draft ready to export uploaded we can very easily change to have it be a macro with a rate to export date and an uploaded date, but

Matthias Miller  42:00
isn't uploaded date, the date you actually want to use, probably,

Speaker 1  42:17
although maybe We're assuming that ready to export and upload handle at the same time, or you do them right after each other, because we have to set the batch stuff when you do ready to export, or set the entry. Or maybe we don't. Yeah, no, we do, because we need to include this in the

Unknown Speaker  42:37
export. Yeah. Well, so

Matthias Miller  42:41
if we're wanting to sync, if we're wanting it to theoretically be in sync and ready to export, is when we create the update the vendor invoices. Or is do we do that on Upload?

Speaker 1  42:51
No, the vendor invoices get happen when we add them to the natural file currently,

Unknown Speaker  42:59
which is here?

Speaker 1  43:03
Yeah, theoretically need another process to go through and set the date.

Matthias Miller  43:10
Okay, here's my back of the napkin proposal. Do we really need a ready to export date now? Well, actually, maybe my proposal is change it to macro. Use two dates, one ready to upload, one one ready to export and one upload. If we can easily do a macro that, if can effectively pull those dates out from modification history using the last field value or something like that, we could do that seems like a bit of work for migration, but it does. But then we can also backdate, then we can also run a process to force update vendor invoices, to update throughout history on these and

Unknown Speaker  44:02
then

Matthias Miller  44:06
we just need to figure out if we want to, if those dates are ever different, and what we Want to do do about it, if they are, you.

Unknown Speaker  44:35
Exhausted,

Unknown Speaker  44:46
and think, Well, I don't want that.

Unknown Speaker  44:57
It does feel like the

Speaker 1  44:58
van. Your invoice date should be based off of upload date, right? If we would do that,

Matthias Miller  45:07
it does seem to me like upload date, because that's

Unknown Speaker  45:13
when you're Yeah.

Matthias Miller  45:20
Does it even go to accounting? If it's just pending,

Speaker 1  45:32
we we base it off of this guy. So it won't happen until it's ready to export, or after it's been exported, it'll go to county before it's marked uploaded. But

Matthias Miller  46:01
again, we could change that just to that just to use the upload date annually. Do upload right? If we had that. What don't you like about this approach?

Speaker 1  46:17
So we would mean the migration is a pain, but it's fine. We would add export and upload date based status on that. And then do you have a process when you confirm upload that goes through and changes vendor invoice payment dates? Yeah, and just make sure that, hey, if you added this vendor invoice to a notch a file yesterday, and then I actually sent it today.

Unknown Speaker  46:45
Then we set it to today, so then mark uploaded would just need to be an X 30 list.

Unknown Speaker  46:55
Yes, okay, talk to this. I'll put us an incident then too. But why can't? Why doesn't my E keyword

Speaker 2  47:14
add exported date and uploaded date base not just file status on that

Speaker 1  47:30
bag would run would be based on uploaded date. We would vendor invoices would auto vendor invoice payment.

Speaker 2  47:48
They would automatically be set to the notch file upload date in the firm upload process is that right?

Matthias Miller  48:11
Add export date and uploaded date, and based on your file, it would be based on uploaded date, yep. And then for fun,

Unknown Speaker  48:28
we do this

Matthias Miller  48:33
install IFR,

Speaker 2  48:40
1117, gotcha. Just status dates. One of my groups that's Drew is that he doesn't send links to his incidents.

Matthias Miller  48:51
Well, train it. That's bad training. I mean, it's just a matter of training, yeah, check that out. I mean, this is really, literally, we've never changed it more than once. So it would also be interesting to see. I mean, here one was sitting around for like on September 24 one was sitting around for six days.

Unknown Speaker  49:22
I so they're going to be fairly out of sync.

Matthias Miller  49:27
Well, they're generally going to be in sync most of the time they are.

Unknown Speaker  49:30
You were saying, was it a draft or

Matthias Miller  49:34
I wasn't they went line 63 in a ID 63 it hung around for six days before was uploaded, marked uploaded.

Unknown Speaker  49:44
They just forgot to mark it uploaded.

Matthias Miller  49:49
And there's another one that's like 48 is like 13 days.

Speaker 1  49:54
So do we care if Drew forgets to mark it uploaded? Do. Just say, I mean, sorry they're out of sync. Or do we give them a way to go change it?

Matthias Miller  50:07
Almost, almost wonder if we give them a way to set the upload date and validate that it doesn't

Speaker 1  50:16
precede the Confirm uploaded have a prompt for date, yeah. Sorry, that would

Speaker 2  50:30
upload process would prompt for upload

Speaker 1  50:36
date, defaulting to today and validating is.

Unknown Speaker  50:43
Not before export.

Matthias Miller  50:50
I mean, there's other, a few other discrepancies where it was Mark same day

Unknown Speaker  50:57
wasn't. Wait,

Matthias Miller  51:04
I'm sorry it wasn't uploaded the same day it was exported. But there's, I mean, the most if they,

Speaker 1  51:12
I think the prompt handles that perfectly, yeah, if they literally didn't act, didn't upload it, then, well, this is the right thing. We should base it on the upload date and find there. I mean, it's going to be on them, though, if they actually export it and don't send it right away, there's going to be discrepancies when they

Unknown Speaker  51:32
try to

Matthias Miller  51:35
send it right we have the longest ones. We may need to manually clean up a few of these, if they even care, 1415, and 16 down at the bottom of the report are hilariously,

Unknown Speaker  51:51
oh, gracious,

Matthias Miller  51:53
three Months. I mean, it's only $9 but,

Unknown Speaker  51:59
yeah, okay.

Speaker 1  52:06
Good, okay, well, I know what to do with that guy. I'll sing, I'll spec and hand off to someone.

Matthias Miller  52:17
The stripe payment tie outs was another big piece.

Speaker 1  52:20
Yeah, what do we even do with that?

Matthias Miller  52:24
Well, I mean, the first step is, let's find out what's going on.

Unknown Speaker  52:28
Isn't it that we talked with Josh about,

Matthias Miller  52:33
I thought he was going to fix, I thought he was gonna fix handling. That's, that's the thing I don't get.

Speaker 2  52:42
Wow, so

Speaker 1  52:52
I mean, isn't it essentially a question of, gosh, why isn't this fixed? Or why are old ones still not working? Well, not,

Matthias Miller  53:10
where is the is it this guy? See,

Unknown Speaker  53:12
it's a customer deposits incident. I think

Matthias Miller  53:15
deposits funds.

Unknown Speaker  53:20
That's not customer deposits

Matthias Miller  53:23
for patterns here. I mean, we still have two. But Josh is we expect this. How do we clean up existing credit card payments, not finding a link, straight payment.

Speaker 1  53:36
So if you, if you open an undeposited they're all cleaned up. If you open the undeposited funds report, then the balances are laughable.

Unknown Speaker  53:51
Let's do an ABC

Speaker 1  54:07
and maybe there's something wrong with the stuff that I'm not finding, but it looks like it can't find a stripe payout, so it thinks it's still undeposited. Well, okay, let's Yeah, undeposit it the balance of 1.7 million.

Matthias Miller  54:22
Okay, so where's the I mean, pick one

Unknown Speaker  54:36
doesn't have a stripe payout ID.

Matthias Miller  54:41
Well, that's because anything we're Can we just ignore anything prior to 2025

Matthias Miller  54:51
probably any, any

Speaker 1  54:53
credit cards? All the rest are, well, there's a handful here. There's undeposited checks.

Matthias Miller  54:59
Yeah. Of checks, not credit cards, right?

Unknown Speaker  55:04
Almost all of them are,

Matthias Miller  55:06
yeah, when I pull up my other report, then we only have two for today, which is expected.

Speaker 1  55:10
Josh is so we're gonna just say, ignore anything before 2025 if

Matthias Miller  55:17
it's I mean, I think we can even say, I think we could even say 2024, from what I'm seeing on my report,

Unknown Speaker  55:32
yeah, looks like it. It's just hard coded

Matthias Miller  55:37
at a system. Switch, I would say a, you know, I don't know so stripe

Unknown Speaker  55:46
accurate as update,

Matthias Miller  55:47
transaction ID, Start date, or something like that, yeah, or a or a, so stripe, undepositive, or, or, or an undeposited funds, a stripe undeposited funds. Start Date, I think that's fine, right? Hard coded to 2021, 24 sorry, 2020 411, 2024 and just Duke,

Unknown Speaker  56:30
okay, perfect.

Unknown Speaker  56:33
So that's going to be these

Unknown Speaker  56:37
are pretty much all old, 23 prior, right, the old

Speaker 1  56:53
the problematic records are from 2023 and older. We are proposing a new system,

Unknown Speaker  57:01
which we're proposing. I'm just gonna say we're proposing ignoring, automatically ignoring any strike payments

Unknown Speaker  57:13
prior to On 120 24 Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  57:27
It good.

Speaker 1  57:40
Is that going I need to work on the mismatch report at some point the straight payments. That's going to be easy. That's an easy one to throw to Sean and have him work on.

Speaker 2  57:56
I think that's most of them for now you're going okay, thank you. It's good. Thank you, sir, yeah.
