Unknown Speaker  00:21
I testing testing one too. I

Speaker 1  00:48
I'm Not seeing you yet. Sorry.

Matthias Miller  01:06
Eric, can you hear me through your speakers? Yeah, yeah, hey, and I can hear you. Look at that, right?

Speaker 2  01:15
So now we're looking at not the wait, it is my laptop. How do I get that webcam, etc, to work?

Matthias Miller  01:26
There's a little icon between beside the there's a little arrow beside the video icon that should give you.

Unknown Speaker  01:37
Is there another one on there, integrated web webcam?

Matthias Miller  01:41
Is that the only is there an option for a Logitech c9 something, no,

Unknown Speaker  01:54
yeah, well, it may not be true for

Matthias Miller  02:01
the other guy, it's a webcam, for sure, plugged into the back of that little document station, yeah, let me

Speaker 2  02:15
check that wire. That thing work as a charger, too. That cord, yeah, okay,

Matthias Miller  02:19
it doesn't show charging. It's supposed to.

Speaker 2  02:22
It doesn't show it. Oh, let me look here, not right now. It doesn't so something's not right.

Matthias Miller  02:27
But if it's coming to the speaker, something's working now it lets you plug. No, I think that's just using.

Speaker 2  02:38
Amanda said she, mean, she tried to figure this out, but she doesn't know how it works, so she plugged this stuff In together.

Speaker 3  02:53
Everything looks to be plugged in here. I

Speaker 4  03:07
um, yeah, I don't know

Unknown Speaker  03:14
now that that

Speaker 2  03:16
that power box match doesn't have any light on it.

Matthias Miller  03:19
Like, okay, there should be. Is the power switch all the way on the floor the surge protector is that turned on?

Unknown Speaker  03:28
Um, think so.

Unknown Speaker  03:34
Or a bigger conference room,

Unknown Speaker  03:38
protecting work.

Matthias Miller  03:42
Okay, the green lights on, and then that power block right there, is that, that thing right there. Yep, that is the so that should go all the way up to the power station, to the station, and there should be on the back, and it's going into the PD input slot.

Unknown Speaker  04:08
Would you call it? I think it's, it's

Speaker 2  04:10
PD, yeah. PD input, yes, it is. But then there's a, there's no, there's no lights on, or there's a button on the top here. Do you do you see that? Shoot? Can you see this?

Matthias Miller  04:24
Matt, there we go. Oh, do you need the power button on top? Try it.

Unknown Speaker  04:31
I need a hole, or, I don't know, see if

Matthias Miller  04:33
I can look at what it does. Pretty sure it doesn't set off any any alarms or anything. But

Speaker 2  04:47
where's this guy just doesn't seem like there's power there. PD and I have no idea WHERE'S THE. Here, let me try this.

Unknown Speaker  05:01
Here, directions, yeah,

Matthias Miller  05:18
it's the top button. Is screen lock and energy saving. I saving.

Unknown Speaker  05:22
That can be either way. Let

Unknown Speaker  05:24
me check something else Wes wants

Unknown Speaker  05:28
right to lock this.

Matthias Miller  05:38
See it should be 100 wide cable. Well, obviously something is working. If something's working, if you're getting sound through the speaker, because that's that's looping through there.

Speaker 2  05:53
I didn't think I was you're just sitting through a laptop. Yeah, my it's just, it was just coming through a laptop.

Unknown Speaker  05:59
Man, no, you're not.

Unknown Speaker  06:03
Oh, whoa, oh, I got you, um,

Speaker 2  06:10
PD, input, powder, livery, USB C ports, that one we can try. I

Speaker 3  06:24
trust is that something happening there this song I did, oh, it's on. I wasn't on. So we do have power

Speaker 2  06:36
Camera, camera, video settings.

Unknown Speaker  06:53
Order to try this, it's not giving me another camera option.

Unknown Speaker  07:00
Well, we can try to fiddle with this later.

Matthias Miller  07:05
Okay, might have to, I mean, but if not, if it's if it's not recognizing anything,

Speaker 2  07:18
yeah, there's power on the speaker, which is plugged into all that stuff too.

Speaker 1  07:24
Okay, yeah, it is. The speaker's getting powered,

Speaker 5  07:29
yeah, but

Matthias Miller  07:39
your computer isn't, isn't recognizing anything from that

Unknown Speaker  07:42
that's barely Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  07:46
yeah, that must be the thing. And I don't know why not,

Unknown Speaker  07:54
unless it's in my settings. Do you

Matthias Miller  07:57
have a different port you can Is there only one?

Speaker 2  08:01
I Yeah, for that, for that,

Unknown Speaker  08:05
for that one, yeah,

Matthias Miller  08:11
one, one. Last question, does that port have? I'm trying to find this symbol here. I mean, does that port have a lightning bolt beside it? No, it's not. So what it is Peter lightning bolts.

Unknown Speaker  08:22
What's this coming out of?

Speaker 4  08:31
What's coming out of a data only port to my

Speaker 3  08:38
computer? Is that right? I guess

Unknown Speaker  08:44
data only?

Unknown Speaker  08:47
No, yeah, it is

Unknown Speaker  08:52
on the front

Matthias Miller  08:56
of the dock. Yeah, I think, I mean, I don't know why it's called data only my impression was that the ports have power delivery as well.

Speaker 3  09:05
Yeah, well, the speaker comes off the back, that

Unknown Speaker  09:09
same

Speaker 2  09:14
thing. Well, no, that's three to 10. The front's one to 10. I

Unknown Speaker  09:24
um, we should switch those

Unknown Speaker  09:25
around or what,

Matthias Miller  09:33
to the back. Data only. Do you have a plug it into the front? No, that's still data. Only, I changed, I flipped it around. Let me just droop,

Unknown Speaker  09:52
so not give them any

Matthias Miller  09:54
options that three, that one and three is just a port number, all right. It's not. It's nothing more than a counting system, okay, I don't

Unknown Speaker  10:03
know why that's not. I don't know. Man, well, power,

Unknown Speaker  10:17
oh, something seems

Unknown Speaker  10:21
weird. I don't know.

Speaker 2  10:25
Well, we'll continue with this. Yeah, there's no power coming to the laptop either, though

Unknown Speaker  10:32
it gets not charging. Ah,

Speaker 5  10:41
uh, I don't know

Unknown Speaker  10:49
we're we'll have to probably get

Unknown Speaker  10:51
it later. Yeah, that's fine. So

Unknown Speaker  10:56
Matt, the question,

Unknown Speaker  11:00
couple things my my main question is,

Unknown Speaker  11:07
well, first off,

Speaker 2  11:10
the main, the main data that we are trying to

Unknown Speaker  11:18
retrieve is

Speaker 2  11:22
pretty much how long does it take to cut plywood? So like, how many board feet does? Can we cut in an hour type of thing when

Speaker 5  11:33
we do plywood? Okay,

Matthias Miller  11:39
so as far as how the time entries are for everything else, does everything else make sense the way it's broken apart?

Unknown Speaker  11:49
Rick, can I got sorry? Matt,

Unknown Speaker  11:56
before I just had radishes for breakfast. Do?

Unknown Speaker  12:04
I got kombucha, yeah,

Matthias Miller  12:12
so is, is are all the other time entries on the cut list that have been coming out. Have those been right the way you want to do it?

Speaker 6  12:28
Probably pretty much so far. I mean, I don't want to add any more to it because, I mean, they're telling me they need more room to like write things down, like mer wants the times to be right there, so if they're waiting on somebody to get there, or whatever they're writing on the back of the sheet, right now, okay, add more stuff to the cell. Because I think if we do that, I used to be able to get 12 to 13 jobs on now I'm only getting eight maybe nine, so it's just adding more. But I'm not sure how writing stuff on the back is going to when I start putting the data entry into this, wherever we're putting it. Yeah, to follow it. I mean, to follow it from the front of the page to the back of the page that we're not I mean, I'm not trying to figure out the information they're writing down there.

Unknown Speaker  13:33
Didn't he write smaller?

Speaker 7  13:34
Is it just too crowded? Yeah, it's just too crowded.

Speaker 2  13:39
So basically, are we tracking downtime on sign?

Matthias Miller  13:44
I had a note to figure out how we want to do that,

Speaker 2  13:46
because that's what we're talking about. And I like the fact that in assembly, we can actually look at the amount of downtime that's been accrued. That is a feature. Rather than just call it whatever. We call it, something with it, even if they're waiting off forklift for the machines. But it's downtime

Unknown Speaker  14:14
where they could have been running, if right, if they had the material or you

Matthias Miller  14:23
Okay, so if I look at the today's sawing schedule, we've got a bunch of we got a bunch of plywood on here.

Matthias Miller  14:35
Do we if we had a way to delineate plywood in the item data.

Matthias Miller  14:49
This is just, wouldn't it be nice if all of life and fit in perfect little boxes all the time on.

Speaker 2  15:01
Well, I think, I think what we need, in my mind, is, simply, is we need to be able to track down time and sawing, and we need to be able to allow a guy to do multiple line items in the same time window.

Matthias Miller  15:25
So we would really treat it almost like a partial, so we could keep going down the road like we are, but do it almost like a partial where you can say, Oh, he also did this other work order during this time window. Yeah.

Speaker 2  15:42
So, you know, so he might, we could let him do two different line items and rate start and end time in the the same on both line items.

Matthias Miller  15:55
And then we just gotta figure out how we want to weight them, right. It makes our problem not theirs,

Speaker 2  16:01
that that makes it out. Yeah, it does. Instead of them doing more computations out in the floor,

Matthias Miller  16:09
is it okay if we still print, print these all separate and they just fill in the one at the end,

Unknown Speaker  16:22
like your start and end. Have a start and end box for

Unknown Speaker  16:25
every one of them, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  16:29
yeah, because you're Yeah, yeah, definitely,

Unknown Speaker  16:33
okay, then we could finish.

Speaker 6  16:36
If he doesn't finish, he's gonna need, you know me, if you say you have five of that wave 21 in the plywood, yeah, he gets half of them done, right, right, you still need that line for the finish rather than a start from the top of the long cell, wave 21 to the fifth size, right?

Matthias Miller  16:58
Are you able to see that MERV the cut list.

Unknown Speaker  17:02
Let me pull it up here. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  17:08
So what if we would change this end to D slash T for downtime, with a blank and then put end under the customer.

Speaker 4  17:17
Now, sorry, you slow down there. Which end?

Matthias Miller  17:20
Yeah, this end right here. Let's go up to the top where you can see this guy, yeah, yeah. Change this to D slash T for downtime. Put the end colon under the customer, and put the blank for the end time under the date. Let me see if I can add it. That makes sense.

Unknown Speaker  17:41
Yeah, it'd be like, yeah,

Matthias Miller  17:50
yeah, obviously smaller than this, but

Unknown Speaker  17:51
yeah, yeah,

Speaker 2  17:57
if you can couple more letters, just write down time you

Unknown Speaker  18:01
and,

Matthias Miller  18:05
I mean, it's not gonna so you're gonna end up with,

Unknown Speaker  18:10
like, not much space. I don't

Matthias Miller  18:13
know what it's gonna be. I wish I could change my Can I change my font?

Speaker 2  18:18
Can you eliminate that those gap, the gap between the lines at the start, and

Matthias Miller  18:25
just fill it in. These have to at this point. These have to follow these same columns. Now, okay, I'm sorry,

Unknown Speaker  18:31
I understand.

Matthias Miller  18:34
I mean, now I am. We may end up needing, just for the sake of printing what we were talking about the brewer, we might have to change how we print these things, which might give us more flexibility in Matt.

Speaker 2  18:46
You You can leave it start and end and put down time under Capri. Yeah, you can put down time there and then put

Matthias Miller  18:55
the downtime and here. Yeah, like and put the underline under that, yep.

Speaker 2  19:04
But for George's guys, you're saying George, they need to be able to write. They need more space to write

Unknown Speaker  19:15
other information

Speaker 7  19:21
all the time, but like, just stuff.

Matthias Miller  19:38
I mean, the only thing I can think of, I mean, the simplest thing I can think of, right off the bat, is doing some kind of, I don't know, ABCD, aa, ABA, AC, etc, where they could notate on the back. Just jot down which, what letter I don't know. I. Have something they could jot down in the back to cross reference.

Speaker 2  20:07
Well, let's step back from back a little bit. Flipping the paper over is always going to be kind of

Speaker 3  20:16
if you forget the look back there or I don't think that's really a good, long,

Unknown Speaker  20:23
okay answer.

Matthias Miller  20:24
I have another idea. What if we change this to landscape?

Matthias Miller  20:35
Well, like, we turn the paper sideways, like, instead of, instead of like this, you turn it like this, and then you have,

Unknown Speaker  20:46
I don't think that's going to help.

Speaker 2  20:49
Then you automatically given up those lines instead of, well, let's talk about if I can't step back like maybe, I mean, maybe this question is for me more than anybody, but do we really care about what item this goes to? You

Speaker 2  21:18
know, do we do we? Do we care what customer? Do we care what item? Do we even care what size the material was like? What is our objective of tracking sawing outside of how long does it take to cut plywood? How long does it take to cut back boards. How long does it take to cut back into five when we split it? How long does it take to cut random into three and a half? So five and a halfs? How long does it take to run cans and get you know boards and runners? I mean, I you guys tracking with me, like,

Unknown Speaker  22:06
what is our objective? What do we really want? I mean, it seems

Matthias Miller  22:11
Go ahead, sorry, as long as you're from a from a pricing standpoint, as long as your constraint remains in assembly, then, I mean, boy, I don't know. Do you want, do you want that level of specificity to say you can, you can come up with back of the napkin numbers without it on what slowing costs. I uh,

Unknown Speaker  22:45
well, I think,

Speaker 2  22:48
I think we need to learn what the different machines like. How long does it take to chamfer material? How long does it take to run material, like, when we when we cut boards on the gang saw, and we also run them right through the inline notch, or, like, okay, it takes a little more time we have to give it's added cost. So we're trying to get an idea how much more labor, etc. How long does it take to slot material? You know, because it's an added cost so or drilling holes or cutting corners, but,

Unknown Speaker  23:36
you know,

Speaker 2  23:38
we're trying to get overall numbers of time per board foot on each machine. We're not really trying to get item specific sawing information,

Unknown Speaker  24:02
which makes it a lot simpler in my mind.

Matthias Miller  24:06
So couldn't you have a daily log? Can we ditch all of this? And couldn't you just have a daily log that says I was running this machine from now to now, now to now, now to now. And here's everything that I got done.

Speaker 2  24:23
Yeah, so like when he's cutting plywood. Hey, started cutting plywood here, finished cutting plywood there, and then we add it up, right? Is that simple enough for you to, I mean, for the program to design it that way. Yeah, and then, and then every other machine or saw out there,

Speaker 2  24:55
start time and end time is. Ain't to be separate and outside of line items, right? Is that okay? I mean, it's,

Matthias Miller  25:11
it's fine by me, we can, we can decide how exactly we want to handle it, but seems fine by me, yeah. So then

Unknown Speaker  25:20
we, yeah,

Speaker 2  25:24
we still need to make number of guys. Like, if there's two guys or one guy

Unknown Speaker  25:29
three,

Speaker 2  25:34
we still need to track yield. We still need that start and end time. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  25:48
I think the question is, what's the best way? Okay, is there a reason why we don't put each saw on its own page? I

Unknown Speaker  26:04
you want to check the Brent, make sure you have someone stop.

Speaker 2  26:07
I mean, the first big reason is we never have

Matthias Miller  26:14
was that just because we never could?

Unknown Speaker  26:20
George, did you

Speaker 2  26:22
hear that the Matt's question was, is there a reason why we

Speaker 3  26:27
do not put each saw or process on a separate schedule? Was it because we couldn't or like, what would be the other reasons,

Speaker 7  26:46
you mean, have one specific page for each machine. Is what you're saying. That's what. Yeah, we then, we never established that. We just had no things, especially in normal things to song. I mean, that's how I mean, that's we just designed that ourselves. We didn't have one specific page for each machine. What these guys are thinking

Speaker 2  27:16
now? Or Well, Matt asked the question, Matt, you're saying, Yeah, that would give us some that would give us the ability to what different data from different equipment.

Matthias Miller  27:30
Well, I mean that, then you would change the printouts to print, have something, some way to indicate how far down the list that they got. I don't however that gets indicated or however they indicate that now and then. Have just a single line at the bottom that has all the information for the day, instead of putting it in each specific row. Yeah.

Speaker 2  28:05
Well, each row still have, still has it. So no, that's fine. We should. We need the yield on each row to make sure we got what we needed. If we got extra, we should track that so we need to yield for each line, right? That's a good point. But outside of that, it could all fit into the overall box. Only thing would be if, hey, one job you need two guys in the next job, you're gonna need one. I don't mean I,

Unknown Speaker  28:45
I don't know, right? Do

Unknown Speaker  28:47
you do? Do you do that at the bottom?

Unknown Speaker  28:50
So then you need to

Speaker 2  28:54
basically, like, same as assembly. You have employee number one started at seven, employee number two, start at seven and then their end times may be different, that kind of thing, but that's all at the bottom. Like you said.

Matthias Miller  29:11
Well, the main thing with that, then is the is the practical thing? How do you make sure they don't forget like?

Speaker 2  29:27
No, that's I like that thought. I like the way where that goes. I like the idea of start and end time being for each individual on each piece of equipment, on each piece of equipment that could be at the top of, like something special or top of chamfer machine, yeah. Okay, so

Matthias Miller  29:53
you, you, you can tell me to be quiet. Zip my mouth. You can have little so you, if you give everybody. Be NFC cards, like just little near frequency cards. You could have little tablets sitting at each station, and they can just walk up, tap, boom, we know that they're at the machine. Tap, boom, they're done, and there's no writing things down. We know where they're at when, and we know how many guys,

Unknown Speaker  30:25
what's it? What's a cost for something like that,

Matthias Miller  30:29
equipment cost or development cost, both. I mean, cards are a bucket piece. Maybe I don't know tablets are. I think you get a working tablet for maybe 100 a piece. Development cost is probably the biggest potential downside. As a side note to this is what happens if internet goes down or something like that? Development cost probably a day or two of my time. I don't know

Speaker 3  31:06
it feels, it feels a little bit futuristic at this point, but,

Speaker 7  31:20
so what they write the stuff on the card? Or do they write it on that platform?

Speaker 2  31:25
We just talking about their time. Matt, we're just trying to get there. We're

Matthias Miller  31:28
just talking about their time. I wouldn't do it with their yield at this point. I think that's too

Unknown Speaker  31:35
it's a little over. I mean, if it's not a

Speaker 2  31:41
overall waste on our part. I'd rather start with them rating their time like we make sure each guy, we track each guy all day long. But when he's asked to help on certain machine, he goes to that schedule at that machine, and he writes his name down at start, and then when he's done on that machine, he writes his name or he he writes his end time, and that's it. And then the yield is a separate is a separate tally that is is added up. It just, we know the yield that they got that there based on what they put in the yield box.

Matthias Miller  32:32
Okay, so, and then when he leaves his station, does he put an end time there, and then put another Start Time in. When he comes back,

Unknown Speaker  32:48
what do you mean by leave? Okay,

Matthias Miller  32:51
well, okay, so he's somebody's working working over at their station, and somebody else says, Hey, I need your help. So he quick jots down what time it is here, and then goes over in, yeah, fills it in on the other one, and then fills in the end time, then comes back and fills in a new start. Times, yep, okay, so, right, yeah.

Speaker 6  33:14
Well, Zach just keeps his specialty less with him because he's jumping multiple machines, and then at the end of the day he turns the sheet end.

Speaker 7  33:25
That's like champ the machine and single hand knobs or chop saw, slaughter saw.

Unknown Speaker  33:35
So I had one,

Matthias Miller  33:38
I'm not sure. Well, you could also, sorry, you could also do one sheet per person, and they just say, then they could have a running list. So they could say they would have their start time, what machine they jump to another machine. Mark that jump to another machine. Mark that break for lunch, or, I guess, breaks would would be auto calculated. So they just put in the times of when they switch from one place to the to the next, whatever they end.

Speaker 2  34:06
Yeah, each guy has his own paper for the day. Yeah. I like that separate entry. And then then we just track yield somebody George, you need to, we need to know how much product they cut that day. So we need a it starts with the top line item. Is that right? George, well, it doesn't really matter. They can. They can. They don't have to cut the first line item. They can bounce around. But at the end of the day, your papers get handed back to you. You need to know the quantities. You need to know the yield for the day for everything. So whoever is in charge of each machine is writing down their yield on each job, right? Somebody, right there.

Matthias Miller  34:59
So. So the cut list would have the yield and we could actually just come up with a completely separate printout for their time tracking. Yeah,

Speaker 2  35:18
we can do. We want to give them columns for each machine so they can write their times in the columns.

Matthias Miller  35:35
I think the question is, I mean, it's actually kind of like that. That way there's no there's only one mark that they have to make. Would this be the same here? Actually, we could probably do this.

Matthias Miller  35:58
Would it be is it? Is it this list here, but then that's a lot of columns.

Unknown Speaker  36:06
That's a lot of columns, but if

Speaker 2  36:14
they could get it mixed up, they could pop it in their own spot too. I

Unknown Speaker  36:30
let's, let's just play around with something here. I'm

Unknown Speaker  37:01
about a let's do

Speaker 1  37:23
um, this should actually be blank, and this should Be one

Unknown Speaker  37:34
here for

Speaker 5  37:40
four o'clock, I went down the basements of a tray for an hour. 45 minutes. I need to get my miles in anyway.

Unknown Speaker  37:50
Last night, take a nap in the afternoon,

Unknown Speaker  37:56
I slept at two last night. It's one by half his stuff going, but alive, just dying.

Unknown Speaker  38:10
Just tell some stuff. I mean,

Unknown Speaker  38:16
work stuff, can handle stuff.

Speaker 7  38:24
My wife was with my grandson next to him, because they were the Eagles came leaving it at home. She heard the doorbell. Ken won at 1244, this morning. That's when she could come back and go to bed.

Matthias Miller  38:40
I mean, that's what let's see. Is there any way to Page Orientation? Let's do landscape.

Speaker 3  38:53
Yeah, I mean, something like that. I was thinking, I mean, we could, we can the list could be

Unknown Speaker  39:09
that's a lot of different stuff.

Matthias Miller  39:13
Would it make more sense to have the list go down this way? And yeah do the

Unknown Speaker  39:20
yeah on the left,

Speaker 6  39:24
the double head, not sure off of there, Matt,

Unknown Speaker  39:29
yeah, we don't have that anymore.

Unknown Speaker  39:37
Filter by let's see if it's

Unknown Speaker  39:49
that. Why don't we just straight up

Unknown Speaker  39:56
configure the.

Unknown Speaker  40:00
We got Bill, you

Matthias Miller  40:02
should just straight up deactivate this guy, right? Yeah, okay, so

Unknown Speaker  40:12
some more, like, Hang on. Let me do this. I

Unknown Speaker  40:25
a sawing timesheet.

Unknown Speaker  40:33
Let's turn this into a PDF so you can see what it looks like. It's too many items. Let's do like, How many would you want on a here? Let's one page

Speaker 2  40:49
long as they fit on one eight and a half by 11. Yeah. Like that.

Matthias Miller  40:55
Or this, should say, I know we're getting in the weeds, but something like that, yeah,

Matthias Miller  41:12
yeah, but now it's going It doesn't fit on a single here. Let's do I

Unknown Speaker  41:23
see if we get this down on, okay, that's one page. Yeah.

Speaker 2  41:37
Some of them are different sizes, but yeah, that's based on No.

Matthias Miller  41:45
That's we can. We can fix it here, right? New Line, plus non breaking space. Let's do that plus, let's try another line that should. Why is that not?

Unknown Speaker  42:07
Still not what am I missing? Oh, this is what I'm missing. Let's take it off of here.

Matthias Miller  42:24
Well, actually, the better thing to do then would be, let's make this guy a little wider, or we could almost just make it wide enough to Well, no, it doesn't have to be,

Speaker 2  42:41
if they run out of room on one page, they can get a second page, right?

Matthias Miller  42:47
Okay, this one, we're taking up too much space

Speaker 2  42:53
so that like a if there's eight columns, there you go. If there's eight columns, well, 10 is plenty. That's plenty for one day.

Speaker 1  43:01
Yep, are these big enough? Yeah, we can here. Let's do this. Let's do a font size that gives us more control.

Speaker 2  43:19
And then, and then shade every other every other Row,

Matthias Miller  43:33
or different color about secondary alternate dating on that,

Matthias Miller  43:49
on the on the columns as well.

Unknown Speaker  43:59
What's that? Matt?

Matthias Miller  44:00
Oh yeah. I thought about having a if you had a four tone, you almost have to do, I don't know exactly how you would do this. Or you could do a checkered. I don't know if a checkered would work, or a four tone. I don't know in

Speaker 7  44:19
the time Nathan start cutting 46 pop or being I don't have very much for next week, Thanksgiving week, but I'll have

Speaker 6  44:30
too much. Oh, maybe if he wants to cut a 6272 hands, I don't

Speaker 2  44:35
know if that. I mean, that's pretty good. Matt, yeah. Okay, maybe, the Yeah, that's good, yeah. If that text could be any bigger, or whatever, that's great, or bold, or something like that, for that for the machine, then we'll have to look at the list. Um. Them. As far as it may still be one or two that we could remove from the list,

Unknown Speaker  45:11
let's go get rid of this link in here, because it's not going to do anything at this point. Too big.

Unknown Speaker  45:19
Oh, no. No. I mean,

Matthias Miller  45:23
it spills over.

Unknown Speaker  45:27
Yeah, well, can you run the lines, the line, the grid lines all the way

Unknown Speaker  45:38
To the left?

Unknown Speaker  45:56
Yeah,

Matthias Miller  46:02
no, we, I mean, we can take it. I can maybe make it. We could probably do 14 here, get just a hair more out.

Speaker 2  46:11
There you go, yeah, so we got, let me see the L and M.

Unknown Speaker  46:18
Is bump on there,

Unknown Speaker  46:19
or is that part of the L M,

Unknown Speaker  46:24
yes. L M, bump, so if you're working

Speaker 2  46:26
on the bump, you're working on the on M, okay. Pendu, splitter, quick shop, three head, slaughter.

Speaker 3  46:38
Now what if they're running slaughter

Unknown Speaker  46:41
can take at the same time, or are we hardly doing any

Unknown Speaker  46:43
of that, just to leave How you going to track that?

Speaker 2  46:52
Write it down in both boxes, do something, um, we can figure out we want to do it. Do you have to tell us what? To tell them something out there

Unknown Speaker  47:09
be the easiest, well,

Speaker 5  47:16
it's gonna be one or the other. Ain't to do them both be

Speaker 7  47:21
able to time together, tie those two selves together? Yes, I'm not sure.

Speaker 2  47:27
Well, if you're doing that, one guy's going to be responsible for the slaughter, right? So you put his time on slaughter, and someone else will be responsible for

Unknown Speaker  47:37
the next step. And the next

Speaker 7  47:39
we'll see there's nobody in between with Cam tech, then just a stacker and a slaughter.

Unknown Speaker  47:44
So one guy's time goes slaughter, the other guy's

Unknown Speaker  47:47
goes what I was asked

Speaker 2  47:52
in legal about, why don't we put a third guy in there? Because he said there are jobs where he'll stack everything and then run it through the next machine. Why not

Speaker 6  48:01
just put a third guy? If it has a square edge, you can send it through. Why

Speaker 2  48:05
not? We've got tapers and but why not put some Why not just put a guy in between there

Unknown Speaker  48:10
to you can if we have that guy,

Speaker 2  48:13
but still, I'm just saying it still be faster if three guys did both things, and we have to do two guys and then

Unknown Speaker  48:20
two, it doesn't take four. So still be

Speaker 2  48:23
safer to go in between people. Alright, Matt, so I wear, okay, Izzy saw Ben, saw one head band, saw boring machine, single head do you want? Yeah, that's right. Inline rips all Bridgewood state plantation, yeah, I mean, that's something special. Would be what like cutting plywood? Can that come off this list or no, we need that on here. We need that on here. What about when they cut corners with the skill saw on, like the Remy pen stainless. That's singing, man,

Speaker 7  49:12
I always put that stuff on the single hand. That's where we do it. I mean, we're not physically around the single head. That's where we set all that stuff. You

Unknown Speaker  49:22
have room for another line that

Unknown Speaker  49:25
we can make room one more. You mean where? What do you want?

Unknown Speaker  49:35
I'm sorry. I'm trying to think what I want to call it

Unknown Speaker  49:41
that will, what that will bevel cuts, isn't it?

Unknown Speaker  49:46
Bevel cuts?

Unknown Speaker  49:47
Is this going to go on the?

Speaker 2  49:49
No, it doesn't happen on a saw. Happens with a skill solve. Do you

Matthias Miller  49:55
want it on the I mean, do you want it in the item data and everywhere? I. Yeah, I was hoping that's, that was the answer,

Unknown Speaker  50:08
yes, please. Okay,

Speaker 2  50:14
and then, and then something special. Call that plywood,

Matthias Miller  50:20
so bevel, bevel cuts, you said, and you want it at here, let's, let's do this, and then

Matthias Miller  50:34
something like this, yeah, okay, and then let's go fix we're gonna run out of room here. Hang on. I want to do one more thing.

Speaker 6  50:43
Here. You put bevel cuts right after the single head. And now I'm asking picky,

Matthias Miller  50:53
single head, yeah, yeah. We even, we even have an empty space for it. Look at that. Hey. Yeah, I know, just do it. There you go. All right, give me one moment. Here, let me I want to do something. And then we got to change the down just a little bit.

Unknown Speaker  51:19
So the start time

Unknown Speaker  51:22
wherever they start

Speaker 2  51:24
with Ben. Starts with Ben Saul. He writes seven o'clock or eight. Right here, seven o'clock. And then, if he goes to a different machine, he writes

Unknown Speaker  51:37
whatever time it is,

Speaker 2  51:39
and then he writes it here, but then he writes it at this. If he jumps, he writes it there too, like end time here is start time at the other one.

Matthias Miller  51:58
They keep building. The main thing that is that is that we need when they whenever they wrap up, should we have a line on here for clocking out or something, end of day,

Speaker 4  52:12
yeah, I mean, yeah, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  52:15
Or, I mean, that's just going to be their last entry, right? I

Matthias Miller  52:23
there no because it's it's start times. Sorry, this is not sorted in the right order.

Unknown Speaker  52:43
Hmm, well, do you all chop saw that should come up under Izzy saw right George, here, hang on. Not really, not really. Well. He

Matthias Miller  52:55
said, How do you like me now? How do you like me now?

Unknown Speaker  53:00
Well, yeah, that's good.

Unknown Speaker  53:05
Yeah, single head bevel, it's good. D wall shop, well,

Unknown Speaker  53:11
because it's out in that building, and these are all in this building, you

Unknown Speaker  53:16
know what I mean. So can you That's all I'm saying.

Speaker 6  53:22
Yeah, if we're getting, if we're getting technical, Zach is of my specialty guy. So can we keep all the specialty machines, like, down with plywood? Like, right now you have single head, bevel cuts, dwell chop, inline, ripsaw, virtual bandsaw state pointer chamfer. That's all his right.

Speaker 2  53:45
Now let's put boring machine on top of single head.

Matthias Miller  53:51
Matt, boring on top of single head, all right, boring single head to see if there's any boring there. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  54:07
yep, and then,

Unknown Speaker  54:11
what was that?

Unknown Speaker  54:18
What just happened? I'm

Unknown Speaker  54:26
and sorry, okay,

Unknown Speaker  54:30
yeah, it's good. That

Unknown Speaker  54:34
up top here we got l and m splitter. The three head band saw, if

Unknown Speaker  54:47
you don't care, George should be under splitter, right?

Speaker 3  54:51
Sometimes don't stuff get over there.

Unknown Speaker  54:54
Sometimes, really, what's, what commodity?

Unknown Speaker  54:58
What about the one? Head band saw,

Speaker 6  55:02
I mean, that can be what's supposed to the three head

Speaker 2  55:05
Why don't we put the one head band saw above boring and three head above one head.

Unknown Speaker  55:12
I'm sorry, one more time.

Speaker 2  55:14
Put the one head above boring. Three, head above one head,

Speaker 1  55:21
three, head above one. Head, 19, okay, here, let's go. Let's go. Make some more room. We're

Unknown Speaker  55:43
and three head above, one head, three.

Unknown Speaker  55:56
Head, three, head, one head,

Speaker 2  55:57
boring, so you got LM splitter, quick chop, slaughter,

Unknown Speaker  56:06
quick job. What in the world is a quick we don't have

Speaker 2  56:10
a quick chop yet. Let's get that. Let's get that out of there. I mean, let's silence that puppy dog. That's the new one. There we go. That's a million dollars, and then move the D wall shop above the three head

Unknown Speaker  56:28
above the three head D world. Wow,

Unknown Speaker  56:32
because that's part of specialty. Keep all the specialty together

Unknown Speaker  56:38
that's out in that area, though, with Ben and Izzy

Speaker 6  56:41
saw, no, it's all Zach's Okay. It'd be easy for Zach to follow that list rather than turn them page, page, page. That's fine, yeah, okay. Like drill on the first page, slaughter on Izzy saw wherever things like consumed into one. Can we take Mel saw

Unknown Speaker  56:57
off of Izzy saw Izzy saw Mel's saw

Unknown Speaker  57:04
you can do slave, and is he so? So

Unknown Speaker  57:07
it just changed the text on that one. Okay.

Matthias Miller  57:17
Good progress. And then what about what about the month? What about monster? We're leaving that on.

Speaker 2  57:24
Get rid of that. Can't We? Pendu splitter?

Unknown Speaker  57:30
No, we get rid of that,

Unknown Speaker  57:35
right? Or

Unknown Speaker  57:36
do you want that on there? I'll leave it on. Why? I'm curious. I'm

Speaker 6  57:46
I mean, we could just make it monster song. Forget about, I

Unknown Speaker  57:50
don't like the word monster slash.

Speaker 6  57:55
McDonough, well, splitter is, was a splitter part is the McDonald, all right, so do Pandu slash McDonough,

Speaker 2  58:06
well, you can split on McDonald, or you can split by Miller,

Unknown Speaker  58:14
yeah, yeah. Splitter Matt, we're

Speaker 2  58:19
getting like that. We're getting rid of all monsters around here. Monsters gotta go and name the Lord, alright.

Matthias Miller  58:28
So that's hilarious, man. Let's see if we can get these. We can probably get these all. Look at this. Look at this. It's a thing of beauty. Look at that.

Speaker 5  58:40
Now, come on, is that the other way that eight is that horrible? Yeah, yeah, that can work,

Speaker 2  58:54
um, date, date at the top. Are we gonna are we gonna print the date? Are we going to stamp the date on the paper and then give the guys a paper every day?

Matthias Miller  59:05
Well, we could, we could give you a way to if we flag the sawing employees, we can. We can put their name and date on all of them.

Unknown Speaker  59:15
That's right,

Speaker 2  59:18
and you just hit print in the morning, and everybody's gets printed off. They come to the office and get their sheet, or Levi gives them their sheet, or

Unknown Speaker  59:26
deal, or she

Speaker 6  59:29
now monster like the gang saws were leaving alone.

Unknown Speaker  59:34
I was going to ask, but like some of the

Speaker 6  59:35
guys that's been rock solid, I don't Well, we change that,

Unknown Speaker  59:39
but the guys on the gangsaul,

Unknown Speaker  59:45
I don't know that's

Speaker 2  59:47
because you got twins that are bouncing back and forth. You got Curtis, some maybe, or Brian, or you got guys that do bounce. Tim McGee goes over there and

Speaker 3  59:56
helps. So then Tim and the twins. And Curtis should have this paper,

Speaker 7  1:00:05
but keys, the Keystone and Brewer is not on there.

Matthias Miller  1:00:13
Would we? Would we do separate one? Would we do separate ones for them or not? Or would you want them all on one?

Speaker 2  1:00:21
I mean, if depends on in the system, right? If

Matthias Miller  1:00:24
we could put them all on one, I don't. I don't have a I mean, here, let's, let's do

Speaker 2  1:00:29
No, but is it easier? Because if a guy has some time entries on here, but then he spends time on one of the sizers,

Unknown Speaker  1:00:38
is that still

Speaker 2  1:00:41
does that complicate it in any way? No, I

Matthias Miller  1:00:46
don't think so. It doesn't like something like that. We got to make it just a touch smaller. But something like this,

Matthias Miller  1:00:59
you have it up well, scalpy wouldn't be on there.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:02
Scalpy wouldn't be on there, right?

Speaker 6  1:01:17
If they were on the brewer all day they start selling in the first block 430 and the second block would be 430 and then they have their name, specific name on top.

Speaker 5  1:01:29
Let's do it for everybody. Joel, dill Mel,

Unknown Speaker  1:01:35
and then Neil. This is a separate yields,

Matthias Miller  1:01:39
completely separate, and then we tie these two together. Yeah,

Speaker 2  1:01:48
now, George, now, can George keep his stuff from his work from this morning? Yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:01:59
you're saved. Yeah, I think so. I don't think it kind of makes me wonder if all the all the pre work that I did, well, pre work was probably necessary to free yield stuff. So that's probably nothing wasted anyway. Yeah, we good. So we can make these rows just a touch fatter, actually, if we wanted to here, let's do

Unknown Speaker  1:02:25
so. We'll have a a

Speaker 2  1:02:31
place where we print, we hit print, and it prints off a page for every each guy in sawing and we have another copy where we can print off just a generic one and write in whatever, a new guy, or Yeah, maintenance guy that helped out, or my son came down for Part of the day or or do we? Yeah, we is it easy enough to print off one for each for that guy then, like he's already we can.

Matthias Miller  1:03:10
We can make it easy. Okay, we need to start differentiating between employees being No. Well, probably, sorry, I'm in the wrong place. Sawing assembly probably, probably their primary, you know, are they? Are these, yeah, sawing, sawing assembly sizing well for my sawing assembly sizers, gang saws as the predominant and then part time and full time. And so we'd always print the full time ones, and sometimes print the part time ones, and give you a way to print off just part time ones.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:49
Yeah, that's fine.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:53
Yeah, I'm liking this.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:58
Yeah, I like it too. That's right. Okay.

Matthias Miller  1:04:05
Employee, so, employee, we've got assembly and then we have part time slash full time.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:20
What about

Unknown Speaker  1:04:25
Levi and John? Means that they're driving forklift sometimes.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:32
Do we care if part of their

Speaker 2  1:04:35
time is spent moving piles around and overseeing the area?

Matthias Miller  1:04:39
Shouldn't there be, actually something on here for, I don't know what you what do you call it from on assembly, but the, you know, shop time or or non assembly time, just to make it easy for them to switch off. And I.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:00
For these guys, all of

Matthias Miller  1:05:01
them, yeah, for all of them. I mean, anytime, let's say, I mean, I don't know you throw a birth you know you're throwing your monthly birthday party or something. Yeah, they could just

Unknown Speaker  1:05:14
stuff like that, or Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:18
So what would we call that, though?

Speaker 2  1:05:20
Shop company, time,

Unknown Speaker  1:05:24
company, time, yep,

Unknown Speaker  1:05:32
or down.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:34
Company, it's not down. It's

Matthias Miller  1:05:37
not down. Well, downtime you want to track on the saw, don't you? What's that company you want to track on the saw? Or it's, it's, it's non sawing time, right?

Unknown Speaker  1:05:54
What? What makes non sawing time is that

Matthias Miller  1:06:01
what makes the most sense to them is that what they want to call it, if they had it,

Speaker 2  1:06:05
they went out to help to weedy or

Unknown Speaker  1:06:11
I like that. God needs a sleeve.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:15
Well, I've been working. I said, you can hire other.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:21
Dad is saying no, but if I can, I can, if I can, George,

Speaker 2  1:06:25
I'm sorry he he's it doesn't matter how many conveniences he has. He still has problems with not having enough of it's just, he just complains. That's just what he does.

Speaker 5  1:06:42
Blue, Lee had to blow you sorry. I heard he's back. And then couple hours later, look like you didn't blow it. And he said, look like I didn't even do anything out there. It's like, it's just negative focus of, I don't know that's just, we've done it for decades, and I guess he's just gonna go to do it, I don't know. Then you can hire somebody to build a leaves. Oh, here we are paying off the money and hire somebody do it. You don't have to do it. You

Speaker 5  1:07:26
I need an offer. Josh, a job, you know, like, let people communicate,

Matthias Miller  1:07:40
not printing the spacer on The bottom. Hang on

Unknown Speaker  1:07:43
name and date. Sawing.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:00
Sawing area,

Speaker 3  1:08:06
sewing area, time entry, sewing area.

Speaker 5  1:08:15
What do you call it? Sewing area? Rule? Sewing timesheet,

Unknown Speaker  1:08:26
sewing timesheet, that's good.

Speaker 7  1:08:32
So this is start and stop, and then the other one you just have yield on is that what you're saying. Let me mean, it's

Matthias Miller  1:08:45
whatever this ends up needing to look like, having trouble with these pesky here. Let me try this.

Speaker 7  1:09:01
That's what it is need to get that TV up online so we can throw us up on the screen you're right, and get everybody in here and lower work,

Unknown Speaker  1:09:15
which means,

Speaker 2  1:09:20
can I connect this to the screen? Right? Matt? That's what we were trying to

Matthias Miller  1:09:24
do. That's what the goal was, to have be able to do all all that stuff, all in one connection. But I we're coming up short just a little bit.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:38
Well, Michael's the most,

Unknown Speaker  1:09:41
smartest individual that we have to figure it out. Why?

Unknown Speaker  1:09:47
What in the world are you doing? What else

Unknown Speaker  1:09:53
Narendra is running by here? I.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:06
Do it. So listen to it. Hey.

Speaker 3  1:10:12
Okay, messing post that up there. I have it out here in my committee and so let me

Unknown Speaker  1:10:24
know. Let's try this.

Matthias Miller  1:10:34
I think so that's the goofiest thing in the world.

Speaker 3  1:10:37
One word, they can sign up. But if we put it on there and there's one guy there,

Unknown Speaker  1:10:44
on the door. I'll get it

Speaker 5  1:10:57
meeting so I'm not sure. Checking that out. All right.

Speaker 3  1:11:05
Mike, can we help figure out this location with the km and speaker in the screen sometime? Well,

Matthias Miller  1:11:29
well, all right. Well, let's just rate it not going to work. What's that, Matt, this is being it's being goofy.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:42
Matt, alright, Mike, it's

Speaker 3  1:11:45
this is the speaker slash microphone. This is supposed to hook to the laptop from here, short power cable going down, and it's supposed to connect to the webcam and the screen. It's all supposed to be together. This can add from out of here. Actually, this computer can be completely eliminated.

Speaker 4  1:12:16
What? How does it connect? Blueprint or cable? It's all cable. It's all rules. But to this screen, I'm saying, Yeah, HCM, what's it not doing this?

Matthias Miller  1:12:30
The computer isn't recognizing, isn't recognizing, doesn't appear to be recognizing anything.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:36
Laptops not recognizing the stuffies. I

Speaker 4  1:12:49
without executive connection, I did necessarily microphone. This is your microphone speaker able to be so that would be, Matt, are we still on this subject?

Matthias Miller  1:13:05
Right? No, we're good. I think we're good on

Speaker 2  1:13:08
this one. We're good on this one. Um, let me go to my inbox. Wait, there was that list of parcels needing assignment. Can you help me understand is that work order numbers that I need to go into and look? Or what is that that's not assigned?

Speaker 3  1:13:33
Let me take a look. Where's a week ago. I um,

Speaker 3  1:13:50
the web, the blanket, the camera is not connecting to this. It's not charging on here, which it should be.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:00
Oh, great. And the

Speaker 7  1:14:02
next one off of that should be enough on the TV.

Matthias Miller  1:14:08
The links aren't working for me, but these are, these are partial work orders that were okay with I think the story was that they were linked. There was a circular link or something. So I just unlinked them. They're showing up if you just pull up the warnings list. Like, that's all you really need.

Speaker 2  1:14:27
Okay, it's just more on the 70 tracker, yeah, okay, all right. I

Unknown Speaker  1:14:45
All right, Matt, so what else did I have? Assembly method discrepancies? Which. What was that assembly method discrepancies list?

Matthias Miller  1:15:09
There's a few in there. I don't think it's a lot. There's a few in there that assembly method. If you want to pull it up and share your screen, I can walk you through it.

Unknown Speaker  1:15:20
I'm looking at here, yeah, hold on, sorry, George,

Speaker 2  1:15:37
so it's so is it all the items, all the lines on here.

Matthias Miller  1:15:44
The ones we really care about are, like on these. You can see there's a bunch that are blank, which might be appropriate.

Unknown Speaker  1:16:02
Where is it? Blank? Matt,

Matthias Miller  1:16:05
okay, the assembly method. There's an assembly method in the usual assembly method, right?

Speaker 2  1:16:13
The usual, this is blank. The assembly method is blank

Matthias Miller  1:16:18
for some of them, but some of them here, it's like, if you like, if you go up to the top right, like on the Arnold 24 hand station was used five times, but it's flagged as using 504, the Viking B, the four to three. We use the B 50 times, but it's marked as hand station

Speaker 3  1:16:41
box not getting power. That makes sense. Mike, so Matt, does it? Is it called the an issue?

Matthias Miller  1:16:55
I mean, the only issue is, if we look at if we're using, if we're using assembly method to for pricing purposes. If this isn't correct, well, actually, no, it's not causing an issue. No, it's just, if you want to clarify item data in any way.

Speaker 2  1:17:10
So basically, I click on the item clarify. You can,

Matthias Miller  1:17:14
actually, I changed this report right here where you can do it right in the report.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:18
Okay, so I can, what? So if you can click, right,

Unknown Speaker  1:17:21
yeah, yeah, nice.

Speaker 2  1:17:24
Okay, I'd have to do that with George, or maybe he something like that. But, yeah, okay, I like that. Awesome

Matthias Miller  1:17:34
again. I don't know. I don't know that's a huge deal.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:38
But yep, I understand. All right. All right, other than Amazon order for that, that was that, that NH, 70270 email discrepancy

Unknown Speaker  1:17:57
is because we're not handling stock. I'm not sure what that was even Oh NIH, 70270,

Matthias Miller  1:18:07
yeah, you're gonna try to figure out why we issue credit memos

Unknown Speaker  1:18:12
on those. I haven't, I don't,

Speaker 2  1:18:15
I have no idea how that works. So anyway, that's the breakdown. I'll, I'll, alright, I'll try to get to that sometime here.

Matthias Miller  1:18:25
Yep, balls in your court. I think.

Speaker 3  1:18:27
Alright, cool deal. Thanks, Matt. Yep.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:31
Thank you, sir. Well,

Speaker 2  1:18:38
will you let us know. What's that?

Speaker 6  1:18:42
Yeah, sorry if you're doing, if you're doing this, the sawing check sheet, time you started, each individual person, time finished, and then you're going to have on a sawing cut list. You're you're just on how the yield and another type. See each larger base. Here's an ad the yield on the cut list. But once you put them gentlemen into the software or whatever you're building, you got yield and you got start time and finish time on that person on that individual machine. How does that relate back to yield and back to where they were at on that saw at that particular time? How, excuse me, how do you know? How do you know which job they were doing at seven to say they were working on, yeah, from seven to nine this morning, yeah. How are you going to pertain to what were they working on? From seven to nine?

Speaker 2  1:19:48
Matt, will you be? Will you? Will we? Are we going to get total board feet processed and divided by their by the time the total time? Is that what we want to do? Yeah?

Matthias Miller  1:19:59
It's something it's something like that. What's the total time they spent on this, on the on this, saw and then distribute it based on board feet, something like it? I

Unknown Speaker  1:20:09
think, I think that's what we have to do. I don't

Unknown Speaker  1:20:13
it's a pretty clean way to do it.

Unknown Speaker  1:20:16
Yeah, I'm just filming. I didn't know how we were, right? No, I really, yeah, it's a good

Speaker 2  1:20:25
question, because, like on the boring machine, for example, it's gonna vary, because we can't price it just by board footage. We have to price it by by holes. So that would be an exception.

Matthias Miller  1:20:40
Well, so maybe, maybe we have to

Speaker 2  1:20:43
be the same way with double cuts. We can't price that by board footage, so we

Matthias Miller  1:20:49
might have to have a setting on the on the saw that says whether it's based on board feed or or quantity.

Speaker 3  1:20:56
Yes, yes. Good question. Great question, George. I just want to make sure it

Speaker 2  1:21:01
was, well, no, for sure, but I'm just thinking so sizers, l and m is same thing, Ain't it? L and m is not border footage. I

Unknown Speaker  1:21:24
I don't know what the hell m is.

Speaker 2  1:21:27
Yeah, it's a board footage, but if you cut 130 fours, granted, you're going to get it's a lot easier to cut 130 fours and about 25 and a half random or whatever. It

Speaker 7  1:21:44
sort of still gives you a baseline. It gives you baseline, well, it's not going to be you mean, that type of a baseline and get them different. You got so many different. You

Unknown Speaker  1:22:04
well, okay, we

Speaker 2  1:22:06
we know, we know average board foot yield,

Unknown Speaker  1:22:13
but we always need to weigh

Unknown Speaker  1:22:19
that against the against the overall size, right? Well, we're not tracking. Are we tracking overall size,

Matthias Miller  1:22:34
raw material size? Yeah,

Speaker 2  1:22:37
no. Like if we charge somebody like 10 cents a board foot to cut anything, and we're cutting four by fours on the bandsaw, we're going to get a whole lot more four by fours than we are if we're cutting 7/16 by three and a halfs like we're. There's a whole lot more sawing to cut that 716 than there is to cut the four inch piece.

Unknown Speaker  1:23:05
So we can't,

Unknown Speaker  1:23:11
I don't know, or am I being Am I

Unknown Speaker  1:23:16
just was that the only way to look at it? There

Speaker 4  1:23:23
you go, power, yeah, the wrong thing was, it was plugged into the power thing, right? What was it? Was it this nice, yes, but this down here, this, this, PD, whatever, yeah, that's a charging port, not a would you put it so this cable has attached to this thing? That's it go here. That is your power. We got power, Matt, we're live in game,

Matthias Miller  1:23:56
okay, but it's your Okay. Plug it into your laptop. Your laptop's not charging.

Speaker 2  1:24:02
It's plug in. No, it's not charging. No, that one

Unknown Speaker  1:24:05
doesn't support charge,

Matthias Miller  1:24:09
although this one supports I thought it had had through power on the I guess it does say data only, so that makes sense. It doesn't.

Speaker 4  1:24:18
I can, I can put it some of the right charges, but I don't know if it's gonna communicate. Now, you know charge, but I don't know if it's gonna communicate. Sure, right?

Matthias Miller  1:24:32
Well, I mean, so where did you plug? Where did you say you plugged the power into, the

Speaker 4  1:24:40
cord fastened to the docking station needed to be plugged into power they it was plugged into port 10, which was a charging port, power delivery, USB C ports at 100 watt Max.

Unknown Speaker  1:24:58
Yeah, that. It, but

Unknown Speaker  1:25:01
yeah, power me see if any of these.

Unknown Speaker  1:25:10
Yeah, I got the right guy now.

Speaker 4  1:25:13
Yeah, where was that? None of the other port food will charge, except this one. But I don't know if it's good mitigate

Unknown Speaker  1:25:24
that thing blinking, or is it blinking?

Matthias Miller  1:25:33
Do you have any options showing up on the for your video now? Video sources on Zoom?

Speaker 2  1:25:39
I'm trying to figure that out here. Why can't I?

Speaker 4  1:25:44
I have a feeling that plugging it in this manner is only going to give you charge, not any communication

Speaker 2  1:25:54
right now. You mean, yeah, well, can we go communication early? Yeah, that's where it was. That's where it was. So do that. There's

Unknown Speaker  1:26:11
my I got a solid light that means.

Unknown Speaker  1:26:18
But what is i Not making

Matthias Miller  1:26:24
again go on the little there should be a little sharing bar somewhere, a zoom sharing bar somewhere that it's should be, should be hanging on top of your screen somewhere the thing that always gets in your way,

Unknown Speaker  1:26:41
yeah, my screen,

Matthias Miller  1:26:46
yeah, your screen, okay. And then when you hover over it, okay, you're better. Your laptop's charging now, so that's, or is that a warning light?

Speaker 4  1:26:56
No, it's charging. Well, charging. Okay. How that happens. That happened. It does not support charging, but

Unknown Speaker  1:27:06
it seems like it is. Yeah, it's charged. No, it's not,

Unknown Speaker  1:27:13
no, it's battery saver.

Matthias Miller  1:27:15
Okay, where it's I think it might be close to man.

Unknown Speaker  1:27:22
I can never video, is it? Oh, here, here. What am I saying? Integrate a webcam. Just put

Unknown Speaker  1:27:27
this. Just put this back in. Let me know. Yeah, that'll charge it.

Speaker 5  1:27:33
I always gonna do that for it's too late.

Speaker 2  1:27:37
But video settings, camera still no camera option.

Unknown Speaker  1:27:42
Matt, is there a different audio option?

Unknown Speaker  1:27:54
Here's the webcam. This one's a little accurate.

Unknown Speaker  1:27:59
No, it's microphone speaker.

Speaker 3  1:28:12
That's No, well, oh, microphone real tech, same as system, real tech.

Unknown Speaker  1:28:23
That's the laptop, yeah, so

Matthias Miller  1:28:27
it's still not picking up the devices, no.

Speaker 2  1:28:36
Sorry, Matt, we got stuck on that subject about the so there's different machines. So should we have a separate conversation about that, like George, and I'll talk about that a little bit more, and I'll get, I'll try to get you an email or something like that. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  1:28:53
Alright, that's great. Thank you.

Matthias Miller  1:28:58
Awesome. Good news. We'll keep moving forward. Thanks for

Unknown Speaker  1:29:01
your time. Stay man, Yep, thanks, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:29:04
likewise, see you, George, bye.
