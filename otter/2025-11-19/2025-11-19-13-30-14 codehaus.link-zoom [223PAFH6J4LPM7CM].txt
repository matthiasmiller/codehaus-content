Speaker 1  01:08
Hey, hello, okay,

Speaker 2  01:18
you want to get into EPO with and without tax, sure,

Matthias Miller  01:23
my favorite thing to talk about

Unknown Speaker  01:28
screen someone just changed the functions in the parts around me. So I'm click grabbing.

Matthias Miller  01:38
I wish there'd be a way to detect that. I added code that detects catalog changes and downloads those executables intraday. But I don't have a good way to detect out of sync functions, because I basically, oh, and then this morning,

Unknown Speaker  01:54
I mean, we had a go ahead,

Matthias Miller  01:57
go ahead. This morning. To top that, we had, like, I don't know, 50 builder, 30 build packages in the queue, and there was a delay on the build server as well. Anyway, it's just, yeah, that's pretty bad.

Unknown Speaker  02:15
Just, it's obnoxious.

Speaker 2  02:18
Okay, so I've been working. I've got with and without tax macros for most of these things, early payoff amount I do not understand. I'm not sure how to switch, like how it would work to calculate without tax, basically because early payoff is just complicated.

Matthias Miller  02:42
And well, I think, I think fundamentally, you need a, I think my rework, recent rework, should allow you,

Unknown Speaker  02:54
had you dealt with that, scroll down to the bottom. Don't we

Matthias Miller  02:59
have basically a subtotal to the bottom of the macro, don't we basically have a subtotal that's like, this guy pay

Unknown Speaker  03:10
off amount.

Matthias Miller  03:20
Wait a minute, this does not look

Speaker 2  03:24
I don't think you ever changed, unless I accidentally over. I don't think you changed. I thought you did a user report.

Matthias Miller  03:33
I probably did a user report.

Unknown Speaker  03:42
Folders. Rollers. There we go, this guy, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  03:53
okay, so I just need to standardize this basically, and we're good to

Unknown Speaker  03:57
go, yep, well, we at least closer well,

Matthias Miller  04:00
and I think it's all within Didn't we say it's all within 10 cents? I think it's sorted by the absolute difference.

Speaker 2  04:10
So is the thought that we use sum everything without tax, and then apply tax at the end.

Matthias Miller  04:19
Yes, okay, and so I think you should be able if you go into this report,

Matthias Miller  04:36
tax new go into the new macro.

Matthias Miller  04:45
Scroll down all the way to the bottom, the

Matthias Miller  04:55
payoff amount with tax, I'm assuming.

Unknown Speaker  05:21
This guy doesn't, oh, wait, has test only not been updated? It

Unknown Speaker  05:33
didn't update last night.

Unknown Speaker  05:40
Interesting. That's weird.

Unknown Speaker  05:50
Subtotal two with tax,

Matthias Miller  05:58
minus CRA without tax.

Unknown Speaker  06:12
Why is it CRA without tax?

Matthias Miller  06:14
I get very, very, very, very confused, but CRA and tax and what comes out is

Speaker 2  06:21
very confusing. Yeah, that's my take.

Matthias Miller  06:29
I almost wonder if you could do and assign the payoff amount without tax, which would be

Unknown Speaker  06:41
this, without tax, minus CRA, without

Matthias Miller  06:43
tax, minus CRA with tax, which takes it down lower, and then we'll add the Tax back on.

Unknown Speaker  06:50
Oh, oh, like it's so messy. I

Matthias Miller  07:04
Okay, well, we'll just save this as a v2 I don't know, oh,

Speaker 2  07:13
but I want to use macros I have in my system.

Unknown Speaker  07:17
Oh, got it. That's why, that's why

Speaker 2  07:25
you're fine. I've got better macros, and I think at macros you weren't you didn't know about something. Some of it would

Matthias Miller  07:32
be simpler. Yeah, I would agree. It's somewhat horrifying. I

Unknown Speaker  07:50
we have one that doesn't have an ID.

Unknown Speaker  07:56
Nice, cool. I

Unknown Speaker  08:10
then we're going to go

Unknown Speaker  08:14
check CPO

Unknown Speaker  08:19
early. Oh, it's early. Payoff. Off.

Speaker 2  08:26
I'm ending up using this framework like the internal with total and tool tip in it for a bunch of the macros, because there's so much going on with the with or without tags that I like having it consolidated. I mean, EPO sort of takes the cake, but

Unknown Speaker  08:46
don't disagree. Makes sense. Look old EPO. Hey, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  09:27
you were doing value and

Matthias Miller  09:31
and then the breakdown.

Speaker 3  10:35
Okay? So? Okay,

Speaker 2  10:48
first of all, is this, oh, this is period

Unknown Speaker  10:54
stuff. Yeah, I ended up just

Matthias Miller  10:56
saying that because it couldn't wrap my head around getting the right numbers out of that.

Speaker 2  11:01
Well, this, that's gonna die. I'm gonna kill those. So past, what did you do?

Matthias Miller  11:12
You might just literally want to, I think you want to COP, I don't know. Tell me I'm wrong. Copy it out and macro eyes, because it's such a bad yeah,

Unknown Speaker  11:23
okay, so contract I have

Unknown Speaker  11:33
look at that, yeah,

Speaker 2  11:36
rent is this that's not Balanced. Let me see what I have in rental balance. This

Unknown Speaker  11:49
is what,

Matthias Miller  11:51
yeah, rent paid without tax. Look at that dude, yeah. And then the rental balance.

Speaker 2  12:05
Okay, I should rename away from total. So think we were using total to differentiate between tax and no tax. Pass due rent. Okay, this is, that's um, some of these I can find easier in the catalog, because I have a whole section i

Speaker 2  12:43
You're wanting it without tax subtotal. Okay, that this is a question on the contract record we are show we have a section that's due and a section that's balanced right now. Do actually means overdue?

Matthias Miller  13:10
Yeah. I mean, I think it's, I think that's right, okay.

Speaker 2  13:14
Isn't that confusing, given that, like, if you get an invoice, it says, like, it says, do as of, when you get an invoice for something, so I guess that is different. Oh, I'm afraid that's going to cause confusion,

Matthias Miller  13:30
because you'll see upcoming due

Speaker 2  13:33
because, well, this won't the due amount if you if you have a payment due in a week, it's not going to include it in here.

Matthias Miller  13:50
So really, this balance, where's the balance will,

Speaker 2  13:55
yeah, the balance will show upcoming this is I had asked you and Dwayne, and that's what you'd said, as I interpreted it anyway,

Matthias Miller  14:04
the balance is things, includes the next period.

Speaker 2  14:09
Yes, it's just incurred and unpaid, whereas this is overdue and unpaid, well overdue and unpaid. I

Matthias Miller  14:20
mean, if anything, I would just flip them but, and maybe we should save this past due. That's confusing.

Matthias Miller  14:33
I don't know. I don't want to solve it now. I agree it's a problem. Now, feeling horribly lazy, but I don't have a good solution. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  14:54
Why are you not? Is it not?

Matthias Miller  15:00
If it has a it's not an

Unknown Speaker  15:03
assignment, not a value. It

Unknown Speaker  15:14
should be, oh, I wasn't. Yeah, fine.

Unknown Speaker  15:28
I'll just do today. Actually,

Speaker 3  15:40
it doesn't matter. I and

Unknown Speaker  15:52
then past due fees. This one you're trying to get all fees, right? Yeah,

Matthias Miller  16:03
I mean, you could do total past due minus past due rent, right?

Unknown Speaker  16:08
I don't remember offhand if we have something like that, but I

Speaker 2  16:32
CRA without taxes, contracts, CRA I that

Unknown Speaker  16:46
I can't ever type

Speaker 2  16:49
balance for EPO Is the rental balance without tax minus has to rent.

Unknown Speaker  17:06
If you discount,

Speaker 2  17:14
two without tax, without, without, without and then some total two with tax. Okay, so what was now, trying to remember what your suggestion

Matthias Miller  17:30
was. My suggestion was add a before in line 31 before the EPA two, subtitle with tax. Add a fee payoff amount without tax. Ah, yes, which would be the sum of the EPA subtitle two, without tax, minus CRA, with tax.

Unknown Speaker  17:52
Great. What am I doing?

Speaker 1  17:59
My syntax was going crazy. Don't know what was happening. I mean, I was just typing it

Matthias Miller  18:07
wrong, minus CRA with tax.

Unknown Speaker  18:15
And then it looks so trippy to have.

Matthias Miller  18:21
And then the line 34 would be contract, apply tax on the on the payoff amount with tax. Keep going. I need to add

Unknown Speaker  18:39
a right you.

Matthias Miller  18:47
Well, I don't know that you

Unknown Speaker  18:51
weigh the contract. I don't

Matthias Miller  18:54
think, I don't think you include tax on line 65

Speaker 2  19:02
oh, oh, we leave it off until this.

Matthias Miller  19:10
This goes well, this is lying PPO, subtotal, minus, okay, take 68 out. And then. And then take change 71 to CRA with tax, with a taxable amount, and change the USB CRA with tax.

Matthias Miller  19:41
And then let's add a formatted text, payoff amount without tax that has the you're

Unknown Speaker  19:51
saying a duplicate an if statement here.

Matthias Miller  19:54
Yeah, I mean without the formatting. I.

Unknown Speaker  20:01
Because this is conditional to CRA,

Unknown Speaker  20:09
yeah, without tax.

Matthias Miller  20:13
Oh, so you really, really here you should, you should put that equals should be you.

Unknown Speaker  20:25
No, well, no,

Matthias Miller  20:27
no, it's not conditional to tax it. I mean, no, it's not

Matthias Miller  20:37
gonna add the tax back on I mean, I mean conditionally on line 74

Unknown Speaker  20:50
Could we? Are you?

Speaker 2  21:01
Okay? What I'm getting this macro should be able to return payoff, with or without tax, either way, right? That's how we're doing everywhere else.

Matthias Miller  21:10
But the easiest way can, can we not? Okay, well, then create a here. Let me do this because I'm

Speaker 2  21:44
I have a macro that just gives you the wisdom without tax thing.

Matthias Miller  21:49
But don't we want to show without tax, like, if you're showing, if you're not showing tax action, we bold just the without tax, and if it's with tax,

Speaker 2  21:59
Oh, so you're going to display everything either way and just,

Matthias Miller  22:02
well, not necessarily display everything we're always going to. I mean, we don't have to show the display tax. Actually. I like that better. Why wouldn't we just do that? Just do this, and then just add an if in the formatting, where we bold the one, whichever one they wanted to see, or

Unknown Speaker  22:39
and then Here.

Matthias Miller  22:55
Let me close, but not quite. Let's do that.

Unknown Speaker  23:00
If you show

Matthias Miller  23:15
tax, if you want to show tax, you still want to show the subtotal before tax. And so if you really don't want to just hide the final payoff amount with tax, I don't know. Again, line 32 can go. We're not using anymore, anymore.

Unknown Speaker  23:41
Well, I mean, if we move it into here, then yes,

Matthias Miller  23:47
no, we should be using No. We should line 35 should do, should apply tax in the without tax amount, theoretically,

Unknown Speaker  23:55
think, Right. I

Matthias Miller  24:08
without tax, yep, I mean, cross your fingers.

Matthias Miller  24:57
One more might just want to pass the. And true and fix it later.

Matthias Miller  25:18
Okay, let's see how badly we screwed up our calculations.

Matthias Miller  25:26
Let's do a, let's do a, an absolute value of the diff between the old and new value, and sort by that.

Matthias Miller  25:59
Okay, we have some wild, wild discrepancies. EPO, okay, rental balance, okay, rental balance isn't anywhere close to the same. Well, no, that doesn't matter. Unpaid rental fees, rental balance. That's ish tax, tax, the EPO amount 600 seems saying unpaid rental

Speaker 2  26:40
how is the old one coming out? 8211 plus 2052, is not 12.

Unknown Speaker  26:51
Mental balance.

Matthias Miller  27:13
Which is 13, minus five, which is eight.

Speaker 2  27:23
Okay, I think it's the old look. Let's look at the live system. It's off, but, well, it's still different by like,

Unknown Speaker  27:34
$500 but the 12,000 is

Unknown Speaker  27:38
something with changes I've made. I think

Matthias Miller  27:42
macros. Can we identify?

Unknown Speaker  27:48
Well, show the No.

Matthias Miller  27:57
Okay. Well, I mean, we should be able to identify. So 20, what's the tax rate? Seven, 7% I mean, it's a little painstaking, but 14, 709 times, 1.07 is 15, 735, which is close? Ep, unpaid rental balance looks right. That's 100 bucks balance for EPO minus a discount, 7674, times, 1.04 7980, that's off by like 300 bucks. No. Sorry, no, it's not 7674, times 1.07674 times 1.07 8211 that's close, unpaid rental portion, 1818, that looks about right 1.07 2052, EPO sub total, 1017, times 1.07 1070, see the unpaid EPO sub total. Somehow, how are we calculating the EPO sub total in the

Unknown Speaker  29:11
old tool tip?

Matthias Miller  29:18
Subtitle is, subtitle one, CRA with tax past due, rent and contract fee balance with tax,

Matthias Miller  29:31
subtotal one EPO, the balance and the add in, CRA and past due fees. Okay, so go back out. So we have the EPO discount. The EPO sub total is 7674, we have the rental balance. Okay, a two, a 211, and then we add back in the unpaid rental fees, 2052,

Unknown Speaker  30:14
plus the CRA plus other fees.

Matthias Miller  30:16
Wait a minute. I

Matthias Miller  30:27
Okay, 12, 742, minus 8211, 4531, minus 2053, 2478 where is that difference coming from?

Matthias Miller  30:49
Is there a CRA amount? Is there a CRA amount on the I mean, it's not.

Unknown Speaker  31:00
That's a standard contract, so no

Unknown Speaker  31:03
Wait, was that the one?

Speaker 1  31:23
Curious if there's things that have happened to this since I right, but it

Matthias Miller  31:34
doesn't make sense to me why it's not straight up, not math, yeah. So if we go into, go back, okay, go back into how we calculate EPO sub total,

Unknown Speaker  31:49
EPO sub total

Matthias Miller  31:52
two, so we have the subtotal one, which is a balance minus a discount. The balance being rental balance minus past due, which we thought was pretty close to right. Do you

Matthias Miller  32:13
have a contract fee Balance?

Unknown Speaker  32:21
No, it's just rental fee. I

Matthias Miller  32:45
8211, right CRA with tax should be nothing

Unknown Speaker  32:59
past grant, contract fee balance with Tax.

Matthias Miller  33:09
It's including past,

Unknown Speaker  33:15
right? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  33:18
so when we're saying,

Unknown Speaker  33:33
I'm curious, what was it?

Unknown Speaker  33:43
Oh, here's where we lost it.

Unknown Speaker  33:49
Yeah, there you go.

Unknown Speaker  34:15
It's annoying, but.

Matthias Miller  35:06
Not. Why not do a string table and then parse it out. Go ahead. Do

Unknown Speaker  35:23
over here, what I was thinking is,

Matthias Miller  35:34
I know, but I'd argue that V details is a is a draconian monster that can be multiple things. We all, yeah, I mean, you're not wrong, right? You

Matthias Miller  36:04
on, wait, you want this inside the I?

Unknown Speaker  36:36
Link and just go. It does it by default. Pipe List,

Speaker 1  37:02
and um, it's

Speaker 1  37:34
with another string around it yet, All right, patience.

Unknown Speaker  37:53
Evidence

Unknown Speaker  38:06
Wait, there's come to this.

Matthias Miller  38:10
No. That tells what the deliberate

Unknown Speaker  38:13
bummer any of me?

Matthias Miller  38:31
All right, that should that should shift the report.

Matthias Miller  38:55
CRAs are wildly off. I'm not sure if I believe in

Matthias Miller  39:07
these negative ones, I'd start with the next one, at least for starters. So CRA, this one, EPO sub, total without tax. Why is this here is? Why is the EPO subtitle sub 2600 Okay, so we expect 2430 times, 1.07 is 2600 that looks right, plus the CRA. One

Matthias Miller  39:45
plus the unpaid equals EPO sub total of 2600 plus 1825. Is 4425 2430 Plus 1703, how are we getting 5843 in the right hand side. I

Speaker 1  40:27
it was either

Speaker 1  40:39
EPO sub total two without you're

Unknown Speaker  40:49
wondering where the

Matthias Miller  40:51
past due rent and past due fees,

Unknown Speaker  40:57
but we're not doing like, where's the

Matthias Miller  41:01
unpaid rental fee. I'm

Unknown Speaker  41:03
curious about this guy. It's this guy. It's the same thing. We're including rent here, yeah,

Matthias Miller  41:10
but we're taking the past two rent out again. Oh, never mind, theoretically, but,

Matthias Miller  41:21
but we're not taking the unpaid rental like a line 50. We're not showing the Do we have past due fees on this one?

Unknown Speaker  41:39
No, there's nothing.

Matthias Miller  41:49
Well past you. Brent, well, Pat, okay, let's try. Let's dive in. What's past due? Rent without tax. What's that expression? Come out

Speaker 1  41:57
to zero. Okay, what does this guy come out to?

Matthias Miller  42:04
Oh, my mean, minus zero. Sure. Hey, so what fees do we have? I

Unknown Speaker  42:33
or is it

Matthias Miller  42:38
excluding CRA

Unknown Speaker  42:42
in the past two fees. No, that guy probably won't that's why.

Unknown Speaker  42:59
Okay, that is

Matthias Miller  43:08
what it I mean. That is what the issue is.

Unknown Speaker  43:12
That's the rate. I think it is.

Unknown Speaker  43:23
Remember what I'm doing here.

Speaker 3  43:29
I excluded from so

Unknown Speaker  43:36
what was the guy we just fixed?

Unknown Speaker  43:49
Which balance the balance

Speaker 2  43:54
need to use that guy, but that's different from Wait, what is fee balance? Don't tell me, fee balance is really due as us.

Unknown Speaker  44:12
This is balance

Speaker 2  44:16
which is all incurred, but not includes not yet due another issue,

Matthias Miller  44:48
is this is wrong, that's including too much, yeah. I mean, should we do a Yeah, I don't. Know, I think you know what we're after.

Unknown Speaker  45:03
Yeah, we're also, we're

Matthias Miller  45:10
also not showing those additional fields, fees. I almost wonder if we want to fee string table because, or somewhere we need to show those in the we're not showing those on the breakdown.

Unknown Speaker  45:23
What, where?

Matthias Miller  45:26
Line 65 we're just adding back in the rental fee balance. We're not adding in the other fees.

Matthias Miller  45:38
And so we either need to, either need to show other past two fees, or we need to,

Unknown Speaker  45:49
Yeah,

Matthias Miller  46:03
keeping in mind, this is fun

Matthias Miller  46:19
that we I we have to, we have to track taxable and non taxable Pete separately. Yes,

Unknown Speaker  46:40
that's nasty little bit,

Matthias Miller  46:45
yeah, sorta, really.

Matthias Miller  46:53
Is that stored on Go ahead.

Speaker 2  46:57
You also do actually need to figure out the past due versus will do versus balance, because we have mixed signals on which is which, and that makes it terribly confusing.

Matthias Miller  47:12
Okay, do you want to I mean, can we just call it do and incurred

Unknown Speaker  47:22
or No,

Matthias Miller  47:25
except encourage everything.

Matthias Miller  47:32
When do we actually want to show the the overdose, the over two makes sense. I'm just not sure about the I'm just not sure about the past the

Matthias Miller  48:24
I'm thinking, let's go ask her. Let's go ask her friend. How you would deal with this. I

Matthias Miller  48:44
am wanting to display balances that are upcoming due but are not due yet, is the terminology to distinguish between the balances do and the i That's a terrible way to ask the question, but they can push through it, upcoming do Balance and upcoming balance?

Matthias Miller  49:18
Okay? You could also do current, do future, do I like balance? Do and balance upcoming?

Speaker 1  49:39
Do you like that? Anything,

Unknown Speaker  49:49
if balance, upcoming, upcoming balance,

Matthias Miller  49:53
upcoming balance, do balance or current balance, you could also do a current balance and upcoming balance. You.

Matthias Miller  50:04
Let's see.

Speaker 2  50:16
Well, what's trippy is that if your current when your current balance, if you have a current balance, then you're about to hit late fees. Maybe I've just always thought of it wrong, but balance in my head was not overdue necessarily.

Matthias Miller  50:36
Well, current balance doesn't necessarily mean you current balance could just be, I think it would be fair to say current balance and past due balance as well.

Speaker 2  51:04
And then down here, so you display it as rental fee past due, late fee past

Unknown Speaker  51:21
due. You?

Matthias Miller  51:29
What if you did dw, dwf, balance, do and dwf, upcoming, balance, do,

Matthias Miller  51:44
I mean, it'd be nice to have the words on the same side of balance,

Unknown Speaker  51:48
yeah, but it just doesn't quite make sense.

Matthias Miller  51:52
There any other past? Okay, you have few balances upcoming. Balance to do well you could, I mean, you could have RTF do now and do not do No, because it's not yet. I mean, it's because the upcoming balance includes both. It's not, it's, it's not just

Unknown Speaker  52:21
a delta, exactly.

Speaker 2  52:26
I think balance due and upcoming balance are good enough for now, yep.

Matthias Miller  52:33
And I would wonder, I wonder, if you want to, to simplify your life, use that top left cell in the table to say balance. Due in bold Yeah, and then upcoming balance. And then just skip

Unknown Speaker  52:47
the Yeah. I like that.

Speaker 1  52:50
Handleable tax. Handle taxable versus untaxable. I need to drop in 20 minutes or 15

Matthias Miller  53:05
Okay, so can we get

Unknown Speaker  53:11
this guy we need to change?

Matthias Miller  53:17
Well, I mean, for for a hack, you could just subtract out security deposit and CRA in the sum.

Unknown Speaker  53:29
I think this guy is what we want. No, this is balance as of all.

Speaker 3  53:42
Right, should,

Speaker 2  53:57
ah, it's just really trippy to have CRA and security deposit

Unknown Speaker  54:04
as an event here, yeah,

Matthias Miller  54:07
well, I don't think, I think in most cases where you're talking about fees, I mean, I think, I think potentially, I think that's where you have to be very particular with Your names, where it's like, I would almost suggest, having functions for rental fee balance, non rental fee balance, CRA balance, security deposit balance, or something like that. I mean contract anyway. We just shouldn't be using contract events, subtotal as a I mean, we, yeah, it should maybe become an internal function. Because, really, why would you want to use it? Yeah, I.

Unknown Speaker  55:02
That are macros like

Speaker 2  55:12
contract rental, then are you see? Then you get into confusion with calling stuff, other things figured out because we talk about rental fee, but then we have distinctions for damage waiver and late and other

Matthias Miller  55:30
fees. Those are just non rental fees.

Speaker 2  55:42
Then what do you do if you want to get contract Damage Waiver balance? Is it an optional parameter for type in here? Yeah, well,

Matthias Miller  55:51
you have a contract fee balance

Matthias Miller  55:58
that doesn't allow blank or maybe it does, I don't know. Okay, all right,

Unknown Speaker  56:11
let's see this gets us closer.

Speaker 1  56:25
Um, we're still,

Unknown Speaker  56:35
we have any that are close,

Matthias Miller  56:40
yeah, once, once you get past

Speaker 1  56:44
let's so the EPO sub total is the EPO sub Total without tax. That's still wildly different.

Unknown Speaker  57:01
Yeah, ETS

Speaker 2  57:02
sub total is not wildly different. Here, it's 4426 here it's 4137

Unknown Speaker  57:07
I'm sorry

Matthias Miller  57:09
it's the similar minus 27 Okay, so we're doing minus a CRA we have the subtotal, we should not be taking off. We

Matthias Miller  57:31
should be taking out the CRA without tax, because the CRA subtotal went from with tax to without tax. So here on the left we had PPO septal With tax minus CRA with tax.

Matthias Miller  58:00
Line 39

Unknown Speaker  58:06
that goes

Matthias Miller  58:20
uh, well, this is something with the payoff already, or maybe not,

Unknown Speaker  58:38
the rent they overpaid. Rental.

Unknown Speaker  58:43
Think, or

Speaker 1  58:55
it'll be easier to read if I do that. I

Matthias Miller  59:03
Okay, so, yeah, the rental balance is coming out differently. Contract total, amount paid, rental balance,

Unknown Speaker  59:10
amount paid,

Matthias Miller  59:19
a minute. Contract total minus that is not that is not mapping. They already, somebody already did an EP, somebody already did a an EPO on it. Tell me you have a non of

Matthias Miller  59:44
this guy, yeah, exactly, they already did an EPO. So we're not handling we're not I mean, what do we want to show when somebody does an EPO? No.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:00
So that's not really add

Matthias Miller  1:00:01
a column for contract resolution. Or do we Yes?

Unknown Speaker  1:00:21
This one's off. That one

Matthias Miller  1:00:23
just looks really funky. But

Unknown Speaker  1:00:25
here's a here's 124.

Speaker 2  1:00:37
Earlier, we were adding the CRA with tax and subtracting it without,

Matthias Miller  1:00:45
if your subtotal comes out right, the same, yeah, we were subtracting it from the taxable with non taxable.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:59
17. Oh six point,

Unknown Speaker  1:01:14
1825, times.

Matthias Miller  1:01:18
Okay, so we have 1706 times, point of seven, 119, yeah, that's the that is the CRA tax amount.

Matthias Miller  1:01:36
No, it's okay. Here's what it is. Scroll up. Yeah. We need to add tax at

Unknown Speaker  1:01:51
an EPO. Add tax to the EPO sub total.

Matthias Miller  1:02:00
How do we get the non taxable amount?

Matthias Miller  1:02:11
Oh, this is all right. Well, you gotta go,

Speaker 2  1:02:15
yeah, yeah, this stuff is nasty. I think I commit it as it

Matthias Miller  1:02:21
is, okay, fair. That's fine.

Speaker 2  1:02:24
I don't like leaving massive wads of things half done well. It's chilling my systems, and if I find something else to change, it's hard to

Speaker 1  1:02:33
deal with, right? Understood? Okay,

Speaker 2  1:02:37
so I can pick it up again at top of the hour, if you want to, I don't know what your

Speaker 1  1:02:42
schedule is like. Yeah, I can do that. Let's do that. Okay, all right, awesome. Thanks.

Unknown Speaker  1:02:52
You're doing all sorts of things. I.
