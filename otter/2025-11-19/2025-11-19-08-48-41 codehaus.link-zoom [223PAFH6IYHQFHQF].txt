Unknown Speaker  01:33
Here you go. Hello, it's Hello,

Unknown Speaker  01:49
share. Sure, go for it.

Unknown Speaker  01:55
I don't know if we need to share. I don't know, but, yeah, man,

Speaker 1  02:02
you have my password for this silver Lin some more, just in case I'm going to get knocked off sometime. Yeah, just so I have, I think I have it in my drawer too, maybe. But I was thinking about that this morning, If you aren't here and I get

Unknown Speaker  02:41
Yeah, that is

Unknown Speaker  02:54
Matthew, no, George, well, I love one here.

Matthias Miller  02:56
I don't, I don't have access. You can't, you can't get it back out once you put it back in,

Unknown Speaker  03:03
I think I have it.

Speaker 2  03:16
Gs, all lowercase, lowercase. Gs, 2025,

Unknown Speaker  03:22
SP, SPC, lowercase,

Unknown Speaker  03:25
Yep, thanks, yep.

Speaker 3  03:29
With that burp this morning, Matt, is that something that's going to happen once in a while?

Matthias Miller  03:33
Or no, I'm going to fix it. It's, it's related to the rework that I was doing for sewing, tracking.

Speaker 3  03:44
And then the questions I had, what I had tagged you to my email me, and Merv figured that out yesterday, so we're good on those. What was happening is when I was cutting the gang saw and a couple of them pieces got slotted. I had everything in one cell on the items category, and I need to split it up so it shows up. What was doing. If we slotted two out of the 100 boards, it was showing up 100 boards on the slaughter for that's just an example. Got it go back in and make a separate line item in the items list. Now we should be good to go

Unknown Speaker  04:22
on that one. All right,

Speaker 3  04:24
I'll give the credit on that one, he figured that out.

Unknown Speaker  04:28
Oh, hey, go for some of us.

Matthias Miller  04:39
Some of us, some of us. You just look for that one week, one win, one win each week, and that's that's enough to fuel you.

Unknown Speaker  04:47
I'm happy anybody said to me in a week,

Matthias Miller  04:57
George, you have to stop being so hard on the guy. You.

Speaker 2  05:02
He's not hard on me, though, no, I know he's not. I will say that.

Unknown Speaker  05:08
Oh, good times.

Speaker 2  05:09
Can't say that about everybody, but you guys run man, I don't know what, what are we What's the main things you guys have

Unknown Speaker  05:20
there? I think it's more than I've had stuff.

Matthias Miller  05:22
Okay, okay, so hit timesheets on there. Well, actually, we don't have anybody in here yet. Hit, hit, hit new employee. And let's go put in a let's go put somebody in here. Let's pick somebody from sawing somewhere.

Unknown Speaker  05:43
Pick a pick somebody from sawing,

Speaker 1  05:45
yeah, Israel, for sure. Well,

Speaker 4  05:49
he's already in here. Yeah. Are we

Matthias Miller  05:54
going to need to have people in sawing and assembly both?

Speaker 2  06:00
Some of them. Okay, should I need a new employee? Should I pick somebody existing?

Matthias Miller  06:06
Oh, if you pick somebody existing, you're gonna need them in here anyway, if you know, if you don't, I mean,

Speaker 4  06:12
all right, here we go. There we go. Back to wait a minute. I

Matthias Miller  06:25
or we got see all these guys are flagged as assembly right now. Yeah,

Speaker 2  06:39
this guy is, that's let's see if I make him active. That puts him on John's list.

Matthias Miller  06:50
If you take him off, off assembly, he'll come off his list.

Unknown Speaker  06:58
Where is assembly?

Matthias Miller  07:00
Roll down, primary roll, yeah,

Speaker 2  07:02
beautiful, sewing, active that it

Unknown Speaker  07:09
should be it for

Unknown Speaker  07:10
now, save, boom, timesheet,

Matthias Miller  07:17
yay, go, yep, timesheets, I I'm so sorry this has been the bane of my existence.

Unknown Speaker  07:27
Give me a minute. Yep,

Speaker 4  07:35
we can go back. Can we have any new employee. Good all employees. Augustine Austin, Barry is he's on in at Oh, not active. Just got a call from Pro officer looking for Barry. Freaking guys. I

Unknown Speaker  08:03
It's dude.

Unknown Speaker  08:04
Now we sent Eric home for

Speaker 4  08:06
the rest of the week. Well, I know, but I know, but he's well, he needs

Speaker 1  08:16
more than just me. No, it's not here, so something, but on their tree talk to him a little bad man that talked to him a little bit. He talked to me this morning for a while for something. I seen him sitting we didn't have,

Unknown Speaker  08:31
I mean, it got to be seven or block, and then,

Speaker 1  08:40
so only all employees you have that are active and they're not all you have to physically put them in

Speaker 4  08:46
there, similar. CNI, yeah, I gotta see that's the problem. No there.

Unknown Speaker  08:54
Well, I'm looking right now.

Speaker 5  08:58
Okay, no, go ahead. I'm ready. Whenever you're ready. Oh, there's been sowing.

Speaker 2  09:05
I was just gonna go back and add more guys. That's fine.

Matthias Miller  09:09
Okay, time sheets, yep.

Unknown Speaker  09:14
Oh, come on. What am I? No, I'm gonna

Speaker 2  09:21
go back over. Hang on. I'm gonna go back wait. I'm gonna go back to

Matthias Miller  09:25
Oh, I know what's up. Hang on, yeah. Hang on,

Unknown Speaker  09:30
all employees.

Speaker 2  09:33
Benjamin, does this? Does this? Contacts employees list. Matt, can I have it tell us if they're active or inactive? It's, it's groups, it is, it is, I'm sorry, it is down there, yep, yep, yep. Got it. Ryan Diaz, Christian Jimenez,

Unknown Speaker  09:57
he's sawing Right? Or. Chris,

Speaker 4  10:09
when he comes in, does he do assembly, or does he work inside assembly? So to leave his name there

Unknown Speaker  10:19
now, Curtis is

Unknown Speaker  10:21
Kurt Lawson's.

Unknown Speaker  10:24
Oh, we got we got two.

Speaker 2  10:27
I got two of them. Wait, Curtis says, Curtis, why does Kurt say Curtis? That's weird. Why does that say Kurt?

Matthias Miller  10:42
Because we overrode the display name.

Speaker 2  10:47
There it is. Display Name. Well, I'm gonna delete this contact.

Matthias Miller  10:51
You're gonna want to, you want to merge it? Oh, merge it with the other one. So hit up, go up to the top, right that little arrow.

Unknown Speaker  11:02
Well, I'm gonna do this first.

Matthias Miller  11:04
That's not gonna let you because he's already in there.

Unknown Speaker  11:09
So top right, the

Matthias Miller  11:11
little gray arrow in the top right, nope, further up for the right. Yep. Hit, merge duplicate contact. Just refresh and discard your changes.

Unknown Speaker  11:31
Yep, try again and then

Matthias Miller  11:42
find Curtis.

Speaker 5  11:50
Yep, bad about a boom. Be good.

Matthias Miller  11:56
Okay, so the main, the main takeaway for me is we're gonna have to Okay, hit continue. I don't know if we have any employees at this point. Okay, there we go, here, here's, here's the sheet, and then it'll have one page per per employee. Yeah, yeah. I do have some questions on entry.

Unknown Speaker  12:33
When my my I was

Matthias Miller  12:38
going to try to have something better put together than than what I do, but

Unknown Speaker  12:44
I can kind of show you,

Matthias Miller  12:51
let me, let me share my let me share something on my screen and show you see, if I can show you a little bit of What I'm thinking. Uh,

Unknown Speaker  13:12
find it

Matthias Miller  13:40
all right, let me know when you're caught up and you can see my screen now, yeah, see it? Okay? So my thought was we'd have a screen where you can actually I was going to, I was gonna add something else on here. I think this would make sense to put in.

Speaker 5  14:13
Oh, come on, that's why. That's why I didn't do it. We're not

Matthias Miller  14:19
gonna do it. Okay, maybe show how many hours have been entered, but you select the employee on the you, you when you go in. First of all, you put in the date, which would be default to the day's date, or, or however we want to, or Yeah, or the last whenever put in the date, and then select the Hang on. I have these,

Speaker 2  14:43
are we entering data at the end of the day? Or what are we doing here?

Matthias Miller  14:48
That's the question. What do you want to

Speaker 2  14:50
do? Well, we have to print off the pages first, right? I

Matthias Miller  14:54
mean, I'm going to guess next morning, right? Tomorrow?

Speaker 2  15:00
Morning. When would you print off the sheets for the guys George,

Speaker 1  15:04
them separate sheets for each person. Yeah, whenever you want to, whenever you want to initiate it.

Speaker 2  15:10
But I'm saying you gotta do it the same morning, morning oak that day, like between six and seven, or you're going to print off.

Unknown Speaker  15:21
Yeah? What will be your process?

Unknown Speaker  15:22
Yeah, six and seven. So

Speaker 2  15:24
in the morning, want to print off the sheets for each guy, Matt, so what's that process look like? I mean,

Matthias Miller  15:32
that would be, that's going to be under the print. And if you just leave it blank, it'll run. It'll do all full time song and sizer employees for today, and it'll just print them off. I mean, it'll just give you a printout with the date.

Unknown Speaker  15:56
Okay, and that's done.

Unknown Speaker  16:02
Where do we do that?

Matthias Miller  16:04
On the menu, the print. There's a print time sheets on the menu.

Unknown Speaker  16:08
Okay, yeah,

Matthias Miller  16:12
so when you go to entering them, it would show up like a it would show up blank and and then you would just start putting entries in. Or that's how it is. Now we can talk about how this needs, that needs to happen. So you would, you would pick whatever. If they start with non sawing time you do that at 7am then they do Ben's. Saw, they start. Ben saw at at seven, they do, sorry, not seven. That's not gonna work. At 1010, 3012,

Speaker 5  16:56
yeah, that's nice. Two,

Matthias Miller  17:00
and and then, and then the end of day, like you put in when they quit, yeah, then that'll and then that'll calculate the break time. Okay, this one doesn't have break times in it, but, yeah. Anyway, we don't have to worry about that. But hang on, let me I need to pull up a thing where I can take some notes, so noticing a few things.

Speaker 5  17:31
Okay, print. Day of.

Matthias Miller  17:40
Uh. So there's a few questions with this. One is, do you want the end of day to automatically be filled into 5pm or do you want to fill that in every time?

Speaker 3  17:53
Well, we go up 430 there, but occasionally we've been stopping at lunchtime Friday, so we're probably going to need to keep Yeah, I would do 430 but have an option that we could change it to noon on Fridays if we have to,

Unknown Speaker  18:08
yep,

Speaker 2  18:12
default 430 but, man, if it's different, the guy leaves earlier, whatever.

Unknown Speaker  18:16
Yeah, you'll just ever ride. Yeah? I

Unknown Speaker  18:23
Yeah, that's simple. Man, I like it.

Matthias Miller  18:25
Okay, does this? Does this? Is this workable? And then you'll, you'll hit save, and then my plan is that will show the total sawing, and you'll see here, total sawing hours, right here? So this doesn't count, and this, this is just weird. We got to do that. But anyway, six hours spent in sawing, you hit save, and then it'll show over here, you'll be able to refresh and see the total sawing. Make sure you got everybody my plan to then is to give you a window where you can see the board feet by saw or something like that. Or, I thought it was maybe, or somewhere, we need a screen. Probably want some kind of screen where you can see all the, all the time, time by saw, board feet by saw or something. Just to give you an easy visual double check that you got, got everything

Speaker 3  19:25
now, now where you have, like, you have a drop down box each time you hit the open, a cell up Matt,

Speaker 5  19:32
like, when you're, when you're filling in right now, Yes,

Speaker 3  19:38
and it has a non stalling time category, yep. Or you can actually just do like, B, E, and then so I'll pop up, yeah.

Matthias Miller  19:52
If you just literally type in B, E, you don't have to drop it open. Just type B and it'll pop up and on these, on these times. Or. Using merge new, fancy brainchild. You can put in 1245, you can put in one for 1pm you can put in like that, and it'll, it'll read, it'll read just straight up digits like that. It'll read straight up hours.

Speaker 2  20:21
You I got credit for something today too. Oh, my days two days in a row. So

Speaker 3  20:30
if you put 154 with no punctuation, it'll, it'll, it'll calculate it

Matthias Miller  20:37
out, yeah, it'll say anything, anything five or earlier is PM, and anything one to one to 559 is PM. And then anything from six, you know, six on, it's a, you know, all right? Or if you, or if you literally put in, well, I don't know that there's any other, yeah. I mean, if you really have to have, if somebody literally does a midnight shift, you can put in here that one o'clock AM, it'll, it'll take it, but normally it'll think once 111's is a PM. And you can't have, you can't have identical start times anywhere. You can't anyway, it makes sure everything lines up for you.

Unknown Speaker  21:23
And this is just for one individual.

Matthias Miller  21:26
This is for one individual. This is for this is the employee name. It's just a silly name.

Speaker 3  21:35
So each employee will have in that where that same song will find right now, the employee's name is in there. You grab his sheet, and you upload

Unknown Speaker  21:43
everything to that. Yep.

Matthias Miller  21:46
And then I'll probably give you a button to my plan is we'll automatically create time sheets for all full time employees, active full time employees, and then give you a button to create time sheets for for part time or potentially even non where sawing isn't their primary role, and it'll just pop open in the list. And you can now

Speaker 3  22:07
hypothetical if I would send Curtis Nordstrom say he worked in the Saw Shop from seven to 12, and then 1230 he went over and helped John T in production. How was that fit into this?

Matthias Miller  22:21
Yeah, so you would go, we here, let's let's

Unknown Speaker  22:29
here, let's do this.

Speaker 2  22:30
Can we act? Do we need to activate him in both? Nope, hang on.

Speaker 3  22:38
Would overlap with John P's tracker.

Unknown Speaker  22:42
Yeah, some guys are doing both,

Matthias Miller  22:45
okay, but, but they're predominantly in one versus the other, or do some split jump, jump back and forth, a lot,

Speaker 4  22:51
one predominantly, okay.

Matthias Miller  22:59
So here, let's do this. Alright? So here we'll give you a way to do this. But right now, you can hit View All employees, and you can assign it to any employee, and then put in the date, which would be today's date, or whatever it'd be, it really, realistically be yesterday. And then what was your example that you gave?

Speaker 3  23:21
If he works like seven to 12 and sawing and like, Okay. And then T, John, T wanted him at 1230 and assembly. Then

Matthias Miller  23:34
you just put an end of day of of 12, and it just record four and three quarter sawing

Speaker 2  23:39
hours. And then John does his thing on the other side, on the track, on the other side, on

Unknown Speaker  23:44
the Yeah, yep, yep.

Matthias Miller  24:01
Does this seem okay? So then if you come back, sorry, if we come back here, I'm going to put him in as 11 one, because that's what we got open over here, if you would. So then if you come back here, you put him in, he'll show up in this list even, even if he's not because he's got a time sheet, even if he's not a

Unknown Speaker  24:20
normally, normally here you can anyway,

Matthias Miller  24:30
it's partially incomplete, so it's a little hand wavy at this point. But I wanted to get feedback, at least on on this much of it.

Unknown Speaker  24:38
No, I think it's

Speaker 3  24:41
I like how you can just type in a couple letters and it just shoots rather than you opening up that Dropbox. Yeah. Now in the this is going down another bunny trail, but when you're doing an item. Less than that big box of items that you're putting in. Is there any way that we can take it, that we can back up with the left arrow back, or do we have to physically use our mouths?

Unknown Speaker  25:12
You know what I mean? You mean. You mean here

Unknown Speaker  25:16
now, this would be in the item. This something totally

Unknown Speaker  25:19
different, okay, like here, yeah,

Speaker 3  25:24
just pick one of those. Pick that item, Okay,

Unknown Speaker  25:28
oops. Or go into the item, yeah,

Speaker 3  25:33
and then go down to the items, but, or the lumber, yep. Now say I usually always use my tab to keep flipping or keep moving over to the right. Yep. But is there any way, like if I'm say I hit the can size or the can't length, and I want to go back to the like the box prior to that?

Matthias Miller  25:57
Yeah. Hold down. Hold down. Shift and hit Tab, Tab goes, goes right. Shift Tab goes

Speaker 5  26:04
left. Shift Tab, where's that on? Shift

Matthias Miller  26:09
shift is right. The shift is right above the control underneath the caps lock

Speaker 3  26:13
right. So hit Shift Tab, and that'll shoot you back to the left.

Unknown Speaker  26:17
Yeah. So hit Shift

Matthias Miller  26:22
Tab, Oh, you do it on here because it's you're looking at my my screen

Speaker 2  26:25
all right. Shift Tab goes right, no, left. Left tab goes left. Tabs to the right, tabs, right. Shift Tab, left, left, right. That way you can just keep because the arrows don't work. Do they? Matt, like

Matthias Miller  26:41
the right arrows go inside of here. The down arrow goes down a row. Up arrow goes up a row. Okay.

Speaker 3  26:50
Now another one is, can you go back to that Items box again?

Speaker 5  26:59
Like this guy, yeah, can you open that one up? Yep.

Matthias Miller  27:14
Or sorry, you want me to do it,

Speaker 3  27:16
open up that item, and then get down to the items or the lumber box again, yep. Now say I'm working and I'm tabbing across, tabbing across, tab and I'm going, like, I already get to, like, sewing prep, yeah. And I want to open a new box, our new line right underneath that. I hit the I hit the plus thing down there. But it doesn't always go back to the whole way to the beginning. To put the quantity in there, I've got to physically scroll over there. Is that how I have to do that? Or is there any other speedy way?

Speaker 5  27:55
That was a great question. It's weird that

Speaker 3  28:00
it doesn't tab, tab, tab, tab, and it will go back to the left again. If I don't use all those sewing preps, sewing, one, sawing, two, sawing, three,

Speaker 5  28:11
if you do this, it stays on saw. That's crazy,

Speaker 3  28:19
but it doesn't go back over to the left, and then you physically got to go the whole way back, scroll or use your slide bar there to get back over to the quantity again.

Matthias Miller  28:29
Well, if you know, if you're know you're closer to this end, you can hit here. If you know you're close to the end, you can hit plus Shift Tab to go back up arrow, to go up a row, and then just tab until you get to the end and get to the next row.

Unknown Speaker  28:50
I mean, it is weird.

Matthias Miller  28:56
It's not exactly clear when you add a row what it is you want to do, which is probably why it stays on the saw All

Speaker 3  29:03
right, because I didn't know if I thought if you and then sometimes, if I do hit that, plus it does send it back to quantity. So I don't know if it's depending on where you're at in that.

Matthias Miller  29:15
Oh, if you, I'm going to guess if you are in here, saw one miscellaneous prep you hit plus, no, I don't know, I don't know when it would do that. I thought maybe if, if it's not editable on the new row, if we don't have a box there, if it would

Speaker 3  29:40
right, tell you that happens occasionally, and then I just didn't know, because it does take a lot of time to you. Don't mean to scroll back to the I mean, I'm getting used to it now, but I didn't know if you have anything up your sleeve. They you

Matthias Miller  29:56
may have to be quicker. No, the big thing I have. Up my sleeve is we really should figure out we should, really should fix these. Give you two rows of Heading, Heading rows, and fix these column widths so that they're not I mean, random width does not have to, have to take up the whole the whole screen. I

Speaker 2  30:25
Okay, I appreciate you sharing that, man, that's

Unknown Speaker  30:30
just a question.

Unknown Speaker  30:32
Yep, sorry, I

Matthias Miller  30:34
can't help you better. But yeah,

Speaker 3  30:35
no problem. I'm just feeling I just didn't know if it was something I was missing myself or

Speaker 5  30:42
or not. I Okay,

Matthias Miller  30:46
so then the other question I had was I wanted to make sure I was, let's see, sounds

Unknown Speaker  30:57
awesome? Yeah, the rates fell,

Matthias Miller  31:00
actually completely 100% clear on this. So we talked about changing the grouping on the sizers. That's awesome, where we would group by the can't size, can't length, and can't notes, as well as lumber. Thickness. We're all the same lumber thickness would be under the same canned, is that correct?

Speaker 3  31:31
Yeah, as long as it's the same length, our same thickness, same length, we're fine. But I was getting some like inch and a 16. Say it was inch and a 16, three and a half, 42 and I don't know what you want me, it was just two different lengths in the same inch and a 16 in that same color. And I didn't even try to open it up, just to see what it would do. I always moved the items. You only moved it to get it out of that, right? Okay.

Matthias Miller  32:06
But what about the width? So you want, do you want burying widths under the same one?

Speaker 3  32:09
Width would have to be the same thing too. Three. You know, me, if it's 1116 three and a half, it should be 1116 three and a half. I mean, I think, are you saying like, three and a half and five and a half together?

Matthias Miller  32:26
I mean, it's splitting out. It's looking at the full dimensions now to split it apart. I believe.

Speaker 3  32:32
Yeah, it's doing it. I haven't had any since we talked the other day. Okay, if you my grouping some of them together, I noticed there's a lot that's like spread out now that they're not, you know, mean, some are grouping and some aren't. So I'm not sure about that one. Can you?

Matthias Miller  32:56
Can you if you see stuff that should be grouped together? Um, do you want to can you, do you have any or do you have anything off from the last day or two that that were grouped too, far, too much part?

Unknown Speaker  33:18
No, I haven't. Okay when it happens. Off the Jot them down,

Matthias Miller  33:23
yeah, just, I mean, if you can just run a second copy or something and and scribble some notes or something, that would be happy, happy to fix it, that'd be the easiest way to get it done, right?

Speaker 3  33:38
And, like I said, if it had like 1116, 359, 1116, five and af 63 I'm just giving that example. I didn't actually go into the solace or hit solace to see, I mean, like hit Brewer and see what it would I didn't know what it would do if he had, like, two different lengths in the same I mean, it's going to give you two different cans. That is grouping them together. That's what I'm I should have did it just to see what I would do,

Unknown Speaker  34:07
what it would do. I didn't know

Speaker 1  34:11
if it was separated or not fans. It was two different lengths.

Matthias Miller  34:15
Let's see. I'm trying to remember this, this, this stuff is, I wish it'd be a little less complicated. I will just tell you that the

Unknown Speaker  34:29
so if we're

Matthias Miller  34:33
grouping text, group colors, grouping, now we do split them apart into separate groups in that case,

Speaker 3  34:46
yeah, and I haven't had any here since you did whatever you did Monday. So okay, but as long as I have that, if I that move

Unknown Speaker  34:55
box, move items,

Speaker 3  34:59
as long as that can. Things that I can do with domain manually. That's fine.

Matthias Miller  35:03
Okay, good. So then next, I mean, I'll also be adding a way for you to, I guess that's another question too. We should talk through a little bit as far as inputting the yield.

Unknown Speaker  35:22
Um, what would be? What

Matthias Miller  35:28
would be the most like, Would it be most probably would be most useful for you would be to have a window where you can go in and you can say, I want to input, yield for, or I want to input, yeah, I want to input yield for,

Unknown Speaker  35:47
for, you know, yesterday, whatever.

Matthias Miller  35:53
And it pulls up a list of all the scheduled cut list items. And you just go down through the list and put in the yield. And when you put in the yield, it marks it marks it as completed for yesterday.

Unknown Speaker  36:05
Is that you lost any okay,

Matthias Miller  36:11
sorry, I have one more question. Then I'll repeat my question. Sorry for jumping around. Are you when you enter timesheets? Are you going to enter those in the next morning, like, like, are you going to still do it the evening of most times,

Speaker 3  36:26
probably going to be doing it in the morning. Okay. I mean, I might be able to do them in the evenings later on, but for the feet wet a little bit, I'll probably do it in the morning. That

Unknown Speaker  36:41
way, it gives me a little bit more time. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  36:45
okay, so, so then when, when you're what we're we are, first, we're going to practice talking. So when we print these off, then we're going to start getting sheets back with yield for the prior day. So my thought was, we'd give you a way to say, I want to enter yield, and it asks you for the date, defaults to the prior day, and it shows everything that was printed on the cut list. And you just go down through and you just put in yield for everything that was done. And whenever you put in the yield, it marks it as having been completed for whatever day you're entering it for.

Unknown Speaker  37:29
And I'm entering that yield

Unknown Speaker  37:30
where

Matthias Miller  37:32
I'm going to give you a place to enter it.

Speaker 3  37:35
Also, it ain't like this sheets with the individual person's name on it. It's going to be a totally different. It'll

Matthias Miller  37:41
be a totally different because we don't care who, we don't care who did it, alright,

Speaker 3  37:47
yeah, that would be, you know me, yeah, I was still leaning towards this stuff. Had to go on the sheets with the guys. But if it's totally something different, now I'm now, I'm track. I'm tracking you now.

Matthias Miller  38:01
Okay, so then I mean it should be a fairly close mirror. If I did my job right on Monday, it should be a pretty close mirror to what you see on the cut list. So you should pretty much be able just to go down the list, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, put in the yield and, and, and wrap it up. And then my goal would be, like I mentioned earlier, give you some kind of a report that says, let's look at the let's look at the output in some way, just so you can kind of like, what was total sawing time? What was the what was the time for saw, what was the and maybe, maybe give you a little bit of a sense of, is there anything, anything we're obviously missing.

Speaker 3  38:51
Now, when I enter that yield, is it going to give me? What am I trying to say here, when I'm entering that yield, is it going to be for that, that particular job? Is that job going to pop up or, yeah,

Matthias Miller  39:10
it'll be for this particular

Speaker 2  39:13
I lost it. Wow, I really lost can't that just be the same, same as the print. Can he just fill it in the printout itself?

Matthias Miller  39:25
No, not. I mean, it'll be, it'll look like the printout, but it'll have, it'll be something I don't know how to describe it. Let me put it together for you, but it'll, it'll be something that looks a lot like the printout. Sure, like it'll, it'll be the same order and everything, but it's gonna be in this, this format where you can go through and enter it in

Speaker 3  39:49
gotcha program, whatever you can, yeah, hash it out.

Unknown Speaker  39:53
Seems good, yeah,

Matthias Miller  39:56
as long as I think, I think we have enough general agreement that I'm good. Are doing a first version of it. I don't think we're talking way past each other, and then we can always fine tune from there. Yeah, good. Your quantity, your quantity adjustments are working so anytime that you so when they change quantities, they show up in New orders. And let's see this one. For some reason, think something changed on it. I'm not sure what that one is. Oh, that's this is not the live system. Good, gracious. I um, let me see if I don't have anything in my test system anyway. But if the if the quantity changes, it'll show up in orange, and you can see what it it wants, it'll show the quantity that's been complete. So basically, when you send, when you send things over to the cut list, we never touch anything that was done. If you, if there's anything that was scheduled, then we'll update the scheduled one and redo that one. If there's anything that was that was unscheduled, we'll update that. But if you, if you did have and they doubled the order. Then we'll we'll add the those as the second. We'll add the second half that's needed.

Unknown Speaker  41:30
Like you,

Matthias Miller  41:32
you already sent part of the order to the gang saws, and they did it already. It's Mark done, and they doubled the order. Then it'll show, then it will and you send it to but you didn't do anything on the on the rest of the saws. When you send it across, it'll send half to the gang saws to complete, and it will update all the other saws to the full quantity.

Speaker 5  41:58
And that that's something that's just changed, yeah, as of couple days ago. All right,

Matthias Miller  42:07
so let me know how it works. I'm I'm, I feel pretty good about how it's put together, but I'm a mere mortal. So let me know if you run into these

Speaker 3  42:19
things, can you go over to Sage orders and open up the last 30 days? I mean, we're on live right now, correct?

Matthias Miller  42:26
This is not here. Let me, let me pull up the live system. Or, actually, you guys, you guys, want To start

Unknown Speaker  42:36
sharing we were, yeah, sure. No.

Speaker 3  43:31
All right. So the green 77 one away from Ollie. And now let's alright. So talk is there like, like when Tina puts the sage order number, if she takes one out, puts one in, is there? What do you say? That was it's like a 15 minute interval in between. When it sends it to that list or sends it to the system.

Matthias Miller  43:55
Yeah, up to 15 minutes. It happens every 15 minutes on the

Unknown Speaker  43:59
hour. Alright,

Speaker 3  44:01
alright. So it did it when she pulled it out and made it. But like I said, when you go like here with the 77 and a half, it's like showing that it's a like pale gray. Sometimes, if I hit that and send it back across, like, if she, if she moves the date, I can see it in here. And if I highlight it and go to send a cut list, you sure you want to Yes, it'll go through all this thing, and it'll say, what is it? The box says, No modified, nothing modified or something. Yeah. And then if I do it again, sometimes it'll do it, and then sometimes it won't. I think it's like if I put inventory in there or something, or something's partially done, like you were talking about five minutes ago. That's where it comes into a little bit of some craziness. Mm. Ah,

Speaker 3  45:13
okay. I mean, there's no rhyme or reason that that's the only thing I can pick up that if there's some inventory that was added to it, is that showing that partial of it is done, and that's why it's not allow me to send it back across. Would that

Matthias Miller  45:33
do it? Think so? I don't think it should.

Speaker 3  45:39
I know if there's an item done on, say, there's 10 items on the Items box, one of them's done, it definitely will not let you get the Senate across.

Matthias Miller  45:48
Well, it will, it will, if only one is done, it will, if the whole thing is done, it won't, right?

Speaker 3  45:57
I mean, starting now, if a partial is done, and that changed since Monday, when you did

Unknown Speaker  46:03
that, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  46:04
alright, alright, that'll be good. Then

Matthias Miller  46:07
I'm still a little baffled, why does it send the first time?

Speaker 3  46:13
Yeah, like I said, sometimes it'll zoom right through. And then when I see that, no, no, modify, I forget what the box says, Yeah, then I'll send it again. And then sometimes it just keep. Usually, if it don't go the second time, it's not going to go. So then I cut my sheet in half and and make a note on my tablet, and then handwrite that stuff in, because there's no other way that I can get it. You may generate to the cut. Let's really, yep. I mean, that's what I've been doing.

Unknown Speaker  46:54
Well, let's, I don't know.

Matthias Miller  46:58
I mean, as long as it's taken, eventually I'm I'm here. Let me check something.

Matthias Miller  47:20
Here we had a big, a big pile up this morning on the on some of our stuff, which is why the update didn't go live. But I'll make changes this item when Tina changes the item code. But then, yeah, if we as long as it's taking it, at some point I would still like to fix the issue and kind of,

Speaker 3  47:46
yeah, I'll definitely let me let you know, or shoot an email or print something off and send it to you. That's what I usually do to try and catch up to you. Yep, I like it good. There's any, any one other ask that I have, and it's, I have this sewing equipment open right now. My special guy loves the way you combined everything down at the bottom for him. But there's the slaughter saw, can we take that and move it down, like somewhere between single head and a chamfer machine?

Unknown Speaker  48:30
Do you care where, probably, I would say,

Unknown Speaker  48:32
right after the bevel cuts, if we can, is that the nine pages I'm sending, he's, I mean,

Speaker 1  48:42
he's, it's working pretty good. It's just a slaughter. Saw was the one that was still on the first page.

Speaker 2  48:52
Let's put that bit beside the Pantech.

Speaker 4  48:56
But you're using, you still use the slaughter and gear too. Sometimes the old slaughter sound, but

Unknown Speaker  49:07
he's mainly with Maine State,

Unknown Speaker  49:08
combining it with the canteen, awesome.

Matthias Miller  49:14
You know, refresh and see if you see if you like it.

Unknown Speaker  49:17
He should, he should.

Unknown Speaker  49:21
Saying, that he should

Unknown Speaker  49:29
looks good. Look at that.

Matthias Miller  49:34
Let me see one one more thing, let me just triple check that I'm

Speaker 3  49:40
now good. One other thing, the single head notchers, where I used to do my bevel cuts, so I definitely got to go into the items list and put change out to bevel cuts. Now, correct, do.

Speaker 1  50:00
Because right now, showing up on a single head notcher,

Unknown Speaker  50:03
yeah,

Matthias Miller  50:06
do you want a or

Speaker 3  50:10
we were taught me and Merv were talking about it, if it has bevels, can you produce your magical or your magical button to send everything that's single head bevel to bevel cuts.

Matthias Miller  50:25
We could do here. Let's, let's just, let's just throw something together.

Speaker 3  50:30
There's not that many that I have that you mean, I can physically go in and do it.

Matthias Miller  50:37
Okay, let's try this item, lumber, where lumbers

Speaker 1  50:53
that's gonna be cutting corners too, so it's not gonna see to that corner. So I think it's fit better for me.

Matthias Miller  51:10
You want, you want to start with the items of the single head. Not sure, right?

Speaker 3  51:19
Either have beveled or I have cut corners, but then I have cut corners on the P wall, chop cells, so too. So I would just need to go Matt, I can. There's only maybe a half a dozen. I have to do that too.

Matthias Miller  51:33
Okay, well, there's, there's like 120 that use the single head notcher in bevel, but not, not necessarily further in bevel, that'd be in miscellaneous prep,

Unknown Speaker  51:49
yes, let's do This right. Less than five

Unknown Speaker  52:00
you got two pounds saying us, think of any others? What

Unknown Speaker  52:17
about fastener systems? Are you going to look for?

Speaker 4  52:25
For boring machine, the ones with holes and then the ones with angle cuts

Unknown Speaker  52:31
or cut corners.

Unknown Speaker  52:37
This card, this guy wants to take off.

Unknown Speaker  52:43
I gotta pick up my summer home.

Speaker 4  52:49
Like you'll be here. You'll be already be here tonight. I know, aren't you, so that day

Unknown Speaker  53:02
I can go

Matthias Miller  53:09
All right, so we went bevel and miscellaneous prep.

Matthias Miller  53:22
Huh? Uh, what about Remy, where some get beveled?

Unknown Speaker  53:29
Yeah, that's the same thing.

Matthias Miller  53:32
I mean, I can fairly easily give you this might be the easiest way. There's not a really super here. Let's do this 20 I'll give you a link to report there's, there's like, 20 of them.

Speaker 5  53:55
You're gonna shoot me an email, and I'll shoot you an email with the link. All right. Do you need any other any other cleanup stuff? Not that I'm nah, not that I'm aware of

Matthias Miller  54:09
George bevels. And there's

Matthias Miller  54:17
one other question I want to make sure I was clear with. Wait, I

Unknown Speaker  54:33
buddy, yeah, it's everybody, two pieces of everybody. I

Matthias Miller  54:51
Okay, so then on sawing machines and methods.

Matthias Miller  54:59
Time for board. Foot per board foot, per board foot, okay, but then on the boring double cups chop saw chamfer and steak, we need a per piece counter.

Speaker 3  55:15
Well, we're we're talking about that too. With the boring machine, we might drill one hole, we might drill nine holes.

Speaker 2  55:23
That's for a hole. We need to track time per hole on the boring machine

Matthias Miller  55:29
so on the item data for certain like, how do okay without needing to I

Matthias Miller  55:49
it so on the on the is there a word that we can use without having needing to call it something different every single time, like per machine, is there a term that we could use, an item data that would apply?

Speaker 2  56:07
You're saying instead of calling it hole or bevel cut or angle cut or piece? Yeah?

Matthias Miller  56:15
But it makes the most sense to call it that, doesn't it?

Speaker 2  56:20
Yeah? It, but you're looking for it in the item data page. So, yeah, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  56:31
So,

Unknown Speaker  56:42
so we have,

Speaker 2  56:55
let's send sawing. So we have to look at, so whatever each saw is going to have its I mean,

Unknown Speaker  57:08
let's see. I'm not

Unknown Speaker  57:09
looking at that email right now. What are the,

Matthias Miller  57:21
what's the, what's the, what's the noun that you're tracking for the chamfer and the stake pointer?

Speaker 1  57:30
That could be board footage. In my bug, it's a piece of lumber. Sure you're not doing anything, but

Speaker 2  57:44
and the more the bigger the piece, the more labor there is.

Speaker 4  57:49
Yeah, it could be. We could keep that board feet.

Speaker 1  57:53
Are you talking about like you mean a point or earning pointing to one end chamfer, your chamfer

Speaker 2  57:59
and the edges. But, I mean, the heavier the piece the Yeah, because it should still be multiplied by the board footage, by board footage and, well, they're, they're going to get charged for board footage, because that's, that's in the price, but we're charging them for the specialty step. I mean, we want to there's a cost to chamfer in that piece of wood, right? But do we, do we? Do we apply that cost at a board foot rate, or do we apply that cost at a chamfer rate? That's the question. So then we have to track

Unknown Speaker  58:40
get paid for if he was doing well,

Unknown Speaker  58:44
no, I'm saying

Unknown Speaker  58:46
piece of ship lumber,

Speaker 2  58:48
no, but we're going to, we're going to charge them for the board foot cost of the of the lumber, right? But when we charge them for the additional chamfer, do we want to charge them by board feet for chamfering? Or do you want to charge them for each piece that is chamfered? That's the question, because if we track, I mean, the bigger the piece, the more handling there is. So we could track it at a board foot rate. Same with stakes, pointing six foot stakes versus three foot stakes, it's a lot harder. It's harder. So we could do that. So we could track pointing and chamfering at a board foot rate. Matt was that makes easier,

Matthias Miller  59:42
yes. So then we're just tracking holes or cuts, number of holes or cuts, or what, for boring bevel and,

Speaker 2  59:57
oh, the other three. Matt, yeah. So. For the other three. So we're getting interrupted here. Sorry, Joel, for the boring machine. Matt it, yeah. Some stuff has one hole drilled in it. Some stuff might have 10 holes drilled in it. I mean, there's more setup, call every hole,

Unknown Speaker  1:00:25
yeah. For now, just

Speaker 1  1:00:28
more work, something different. But for now, keep doing it.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:38
Yeah, just continue doing it. I

Unknown Speaker  1:00:46
she take care of that,

Unknown Speaker  1:00:50
probably, if she would have knew that, but she

Unknown Speaker  1:00:53
didn't know the answer was Cecil, no question.

Speaker 2  1:01:01
Which was, I mean, just saying that would be helpful, right? That'd be good. No. Matt, so boring machine, each hole is more work.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:13
Oh, sorry, I can't hear you. But

Unknown Speaker  1:01:21
are you talking to us? Man, I can't hear you one second.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:30
I didn't know he skipped out.

Speaker 4  1:01:37
In other words, if we're in a meeting like this. And Cecil's in Georgia, sowing, he takes care

Speaker 2  1:01:46
well, doesn't interrupt. That's you know, I mean every time you get interrupted,

Speaker 4  1:01:53
eliminates many interruptions. Sometimes do I mean, you asked Michael said, Can you leave your radio on tomorrow? No, he's got a wedding next. He might be able to go the last time or the third time, I'm not sure, but I asked him if he could leave this radio out of the management meeting. Anyway, that's who we've been in. In a sense, it's a but, like there's a guy in maintenance that's responsible. He knows Michael's in a meeting. He takes the call and Dave could do that he would do Michael saw, here would be very good.

Unknown Speaker  1:02:50
Alright, I'm back. Yes, sir. Boring machine, bevel with chop saw,

Speaker 2  1:02:59
so yep, start with the boring machine that's unique. But every hole, some, some pieces we've done have one hole drill. Some pieces have nine or 10 or whatever. Every hole, some, some pieces have holes drill one direction and then flip it on its edge, and it's another hole worth two drilled in that direction. Every hole is more work and all that. So yep, that helmets has to be tracked per hole. Yep,

Speaker 5  1:03:31
on Bell, sorry. Keep going. No, keep going. You're good three

Speaker 2  1:03:38
well, on bevel. There's some pieces that'll have a bevel cut on one end. Some pieces have a bevel cut on both ends. So I'm not sure how to get around that difference without tracking the the how many bevel cuts. Rick,

Speaker 2  1:04:03
then chops all same thing. Some pieces may have one angle. Some pieces have four angles on the corners. Yep, 123, or four. So,

Matthias Miller  1:04:21
oh, that's, that's fair enough. It simplifies it. I mean, I think that's good enough. I think number of holes, select cuts or something, we'll just call it that and, and that'll,

Speaker 2  1:04:33
yeah, that's good. Matt hole slash specialty. We could say special. You could call it specialty cuts. I mean, a hole is a drill. Cut is a drill cutting through the wood, a bevels, a cut and a chopped angles. You could call it specialty cuts, if you want to throw everything in one category. But then, how do we in the. Item data like we, you know, somehow we need to relay

Matthias Miller  1:05:08
that numbers, number specialty cuts.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:11
I mean, if you want to categorize it all in one, is that fair?

Speaker 3  1:05:16
George, well, could you do that drop like we have the drop box on the each individual. Can you have a drop box that has that has them items in like, holes, holes per or not, holes, holes, bevels.

Speaker 2  1:05:34
So in other words, if I would pick boring machine, wherever it is here, do here, oh, there it is, fellow pick, boring machine.

Speaker 2  1:05:56
Could we? Could we have a category, a subcategory? First? Could there be a subcategory there? Matt, with the quantity it'd be, it'd be three. I it'd be the boring machine, the the bevel cuts and the chop saw. That aren't that are that we wouldn't charge at a board foot rate.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:30
Yep.

Speaker 2  1:06:39
And then back to chamfer and pointer. We will have the board foot data already, but the fact that it's chamfered or pointed adds additional cost. So we have another separate rate, a separate board foot rate for chamfering and a separate board foot rate for pointing separate from the other. Yeah, the separate cost,

Unknown Speaker  1:07:11
right? And

Speaker 2  1:07:17
yep, well, and then notching on the Keystone. We already have the size on Keystone and the time and the guys working on that, but notching that piece of material, that piece of lumber, is additional cost, which we can also charge at a board foot rate, but it has to just it's like chamfering. It's like pointing. It's another cost at the board Foot rate, sure I

Unknown Speaker  1:08:33
Okay, I

Matthias Miller  1:08:43
so that we will need to, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:08:57
well, I think the only thing that,

Unknown Speaker  1:09:08
I think the only thing we need to change that needs to be changed in the

Speaker 2  1:09:16
for sawing, In the item in well, in item data is just, was it if it's boring machine or bevel cuts or chop saw, we need to have subcategory to for the num for the number of holes, the number of bevel cuts, the Number of angle cuts on each of those, but then chamfering, pointing and notching is the information's already in here, right? Yep,

Unknown Speaker  1:09:49
yep.

Speaker 2  1:09:50
You don't need anything else. It's just when you when we're doing the as for a pricing tool, we're going to have to add a another. Category of cost when it's chamfered, appointed or notched.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:05
Yep, makes sense. Yeah. Do you

Matthias Miller  1:10:18
at what point would you like

Matthias Miller  1:10:27
to there's there's no rush here. I've got plenty to keep my head occupied today, but I thought it might be good if you get time before Monday to drill deeper down. I don't know. I don't even know if it's necessary, or am I even going to get there by then,

Speaker 2  1:10:47
Friday. I can Friday. I can Matt, okay, anytime Friday at this point.

Matthias Miller  1:10:56
Okay, well, maybe we should just plan on.

Matthias Miller  1:11:07
What have we just planned on? First thing, whenever is a good time Friday morning for you to start on that

Speaker 2  1:11:21
Friday morning. Yeah, yeah, alright, let me check my calendar.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:27
Are you ever seeing? Who's ever seen the lunch

Unknown Speaker  1:11:36
about I'll let you so you

Speaker 2  1:11:42
want to run with it. Oh, what's your birthday? Your mom wasn't going to do birthday. No, I don't

Speaker 6  1:11:46
want your birthdays watch. Yeah, your shirt things. Or am I just putting around the shirts can be another well, they gotta get done.

Speaker 2  1:11:55
Sorry, no, but you can hand it in there. Well, I can say something, but who's Matt? We better jump off

Speaker 5  1:12:00
here. Okay, just text me. Thank you, sir, see ya. Yep, bye.
