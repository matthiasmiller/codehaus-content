Speaker 1  00:37
Okay, here I am, hey, sending another craft report for zoom because it keeps crashing. Whenever I join a call.

Matthias Miller  00:46
You like to know why adjust your times for the Zoom crashes. I'll be there in one minute. No two Exactly.

Unknown Speaker  00:56
Got a pattern estimate

Matthias Miller  00:59
exactly what? Exactly double our times. Okay, so

Unknown Speaker  01:07
EPO, we take the the

Matthias Miller  01:10
reason is that

Matthias Miller  01:23
I think what needs to happen. See, here's where I'm not

Speaker 1  01:27
if you're in the office here, then you could have some Dr Pepper and a goblet.

Matthias Miller  01:32
Oh, look at that. We used to have great fun having our green tea. Well, green tea, green tea. It always okay. You know, a little bit more interesting, exactly. That's funny, Dr Pepper in a goblet. Sounds great. Actually, get some goblets. Why not? Actually, sorry, add moment you started it. We want to get branded merch for the podcast and the big glass, like beer steins, is one of the things. Oh yeah, glass edge.

Unknown Speaker  02:10
Anyways, that's cool. So, so we take, well,

Matthias Miller  02:22
okay, it's part. Okay. There's two issues. One is early, okay, no, this is an early payoff issue at this point. So the rental balance. Why is the rental balance negative? I Where are you on these? No, we're not. We're looking at this year, right? Never mind. Or 4238 we're in the CRA sorry, okay, okay, so we take the taxable subtotal.

Matthias Miller  03:05
I minus the non taxable CRA, give us the payment amount. Let me see if I can find his EPO thing. Copy, proposed copy. A Dwayne Burke,

Unknown Speaker  03:30
posed EPO. EPO I

Unknown Speaker  03:43
we have the

Unknown Speaker  03:53
EPO mock up.

Matthias Miller  04:05
Okay, we Okay, the CRA, the 4000 that you pay, is the full amount less, and the calculated CRA is less tax, which is what we use to determine your effective payment,

Matthias Miller  04:30
I'll understand so you have the EPO sub total without tax.

Speaker 1  05:00
So in our old calculations, we applied tax before subtracting the subfield without tax. So we're including tax for CRA, which maybe that's what you were saying, but I'm catching, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  05:13
yep. Was that right?

Speaker 1  05:19
I think so. But this sounds intentional, but I don't remember why

Matthias Miller  05:22
it is intentional. See if I can articulate it.

Matthias Miller  05:35
I mean, okay, so first of all, we look at the

Unknown Speaker  05:37
taxable, yeah,

Matthias Miller  05:40
okay, I believe so. I mean, because, okay, when you make a $4,000 carry payment, you'll have, you'll be able to apply 3687 to your to your rental portion, to your contract,

Matthias Miller  05:58
and then you but here's where the taxability, the weird taxability stuff, comes in, because

Matthias Miller  06:13
it feels like you're Double paying taxes. But I know it's not true. Um,

Unknown Speaker  07:09
should we be applying tax

Speaker 1  07:15
to the EPO sub total and then subtracting CRA?

Matthias Miller  07:22
Well? I mean, that's how we get it to match. But then what's the without tax amount

Speaker 1  07:31
plus the EPS subject launch, still subtract CRA or is that wrong? I

Matthias Miller  07:49
Oh, I get what you're saying. Is that right? So you're saying you would take the subtotal, you would right here, do that. Could add an EPO subtitle with tax, if

Unknown Speaker  08:06
it's tax, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  08:22
I keep doing that, I

Matthias Miller  08:30
wish I could rationalize it better. I'm really not very happy with my rationalization of it.

Speaker 1  08:35
I'm just remembering these confusion over this before, but that's not very helpful. Like, oh, that's not a parameter course. And then payoff amount without tax is this? Payoff amount with tax in this world is some V, E, P, O, subto with tax minus, minus CRA, without, right.

Unknown Speaker  09:21
And then

Matthias Miller  09:31
with taxes that

Matthias Miller  09:38
minus, I mean, that should just work now, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  09:47
might have a tiny bit of noise. So if we get away from early payoff,

Unknown Speaker  09:58
which might take some doing.

Unknown Speaker  10:01
Oh, I saw one. I thought, yeah, this is

Matthias Miller  10:11
something else, 39

Unknown Speaker  10:20
the rental fee balance is pretty different,

Unknown Speaker  10:23
right? That's weird.

Speaker 1  10:32
We have, oh, this is gonna, it's right here, this part of it probably 27 I think we're summing I think we're double counting stuff in here.

Matthias Miller  10:47
Wait, I wonder we had unpaid What did I contract? Fee, balance, total, tool tip. Oh, that's why i

Unknown Speaker  11:12
Why i

Matthias Miller  11:30
I'm added 02 on your string when I paid fees. Please Online, 17.

Unknown Speaker  11:49
Unpaid for

Unknown Speaker  12:11
sure,

Unknown Speaker  12:20
temporarily, sure.

Matthias Miller  12:38
Wait, what is the we shouldn't have added other fees back in the contract balance fees. Balance is showing the total balance other fees is. But where is the there's another. And why is that? 2x Damage Waiver fees? I

Unknown Speaker  13:05
Yeah, the damage waiver fee balances

Matthias Miller  13:09
is 920, times two is 1840 why?

Unknown Speaker  13:15
How is there more overdue? That

Unknown Speaker  13:20
makes no sense,

Matthias Miller  13:22
more I would do than not that's probably worth seems a worthy question. Um,

Unknown Speaker  13:54
into the relevant events I will do As of

Unknown Speaker  14:21
event due date is less than and the event, I don't know why we want that, and check there if the due date, oh, it's for late fees.

Matthias Miller  14:36
Maybe future entries. Well, I mean, if you want to, you want to ignore future entries as of historic i of

Unknown Speaker  14:44
historic, yeah, yeah. But where's the

Unknown Speaker  14:51
Okay? Let me just.

Unknown Speaker  15:01
Are you Timothy?

Unknown Speaker  15:33
I bet it's actually that, yeah, no, because We're after 913

Matthias Miller  15:41
though we Are after 913 we

Unknown Speaker  16:03
be Right

Matthias Miller  17:20
I mean that should be 920, yeah, it's

Unknown Speaker  18:35
What it's missing a row. It's not getting the paid row.

Unknown Speaker  18:52
Okay?

Unknown Speaker  19:00
The due dates blank. That changed recently?

Unknown Speaker  19:06
No, no, it shouldn't be blank. It, no, it's what

Matthias Miller  19:17
Jonathan not stomping it incorrectly.

Unknown Speaker  19:20
This is you all think, maybe not.

Unknown Speaker  19:35
I mean, do they technically? I mean, shouldn't we be looking at

Unknown Speaker  19:47
how does it work to look at paid rows?

Matthias Miller  19:51
Technically, you should only look at the due date for incurred rows and then look at payments regardless of the due date. Do. Yeah, right.

Speaker 2  20:22
I well, But it's very good. I'm going

Speaker 1  20:46
to figure out which syntax is easier to understand we

Matthias Miller  20:59
have to match based on periods, if

Speaker 1  21:07
it's incurs, not, if the entry date is less than or equal to, as if they can

Matthias Miller  21:17
What If you pay for a different period, and

Unknown Speaker  21:22
if you future, don't we automatically incur rows or not?

Matthias Miller  21:28
Oh, but then Yeah, but you're not going to include the incurred rows, right?

Unknown Speaker  21:42
So how do we do it? Then,

Matthias Miller  21:44
seems to me like we should get we should look at all incurred rows and do a secondary look at payments towards those that fee type in period.

Unknown Speaker  22:05
This is where you almost wonder if we should go back to periods, fracture, stuff.

Unknown Speaker  22:32
Know, I need to completely rework this whole structure there. Yeah,

Speaker 1  22:46
I think the records I was looking at, the imported records, all had the due date stomped on them,

Matthias Miller  22:53
right? Well, we can say it needs to. I mean, I don't know if that's a problem, and just process whereby you clean it up.

Unknown Speaker  23:12
I mean, then it's fairly simple, right? Yeah, then we can do what I was doing, then you can do what you were doing.

Speaker 1  23:34
I would I had changed it to only be required. It's incurred.

Speaker 1  23:44
See, what do you do with like a security deposit? Does that have a due date?

Speaker 2  23:50
No, I

Matthias Miller  24:09
Okay, so

Matthias Miller  24:16
isn't it basically true that for any increments you're looking at the due date, and for anything else, you're looking at the entry date. It's a little weird, but if you forgive a fee,

Unknown Speaker  24:34
no, though,

Matthias Miller  24:37
if you forgive a fee prior to it being due, do you want to show a credit until it's due? No?

Unknown Speaker  24:59
Do we have. To have an effective date,

Unknown Speaker  25:04
macro or something, maybe cash, but

Unknown Speaker  25:12
where you do special stuff like that or not,

Matthias Miller  25:16
like basically, where when it a macro or something that says when it hits the balance, yeah, which is basically the period due date.

Unknown Speaker  25:29
Is it just a period due date? Well,

Matthias Miller  25:34
for rental fees, period date for other fees, it's the date it was incurred. For prepayments, it's always the date it was incurred. For post payment, it's the date the payment was made. For security deposit, it's the defective date. CRA, if

Speaker 1  26:01
someone, if someone goes and pays ahead, I guess we just say their balance is zero, with a future, a much more future. Well, I

Matthias Miller  26:28
seems very messy. Why is it so complicated? Seems like it should be dropped dead simple. That's what I thought.

Speaker 1  26:42
That's what I was I had it dropped dead simple. I was just ripping through the RG. I wasn't thinking about future payments and stuff.

Matthias Miller  26:56
Well, maybe this would be a good time to call it a day. Well, actually, no, it's just 430 there. Maybe it would be, maybe we should just table it and come back to it.

Unknown Speaker  27:06
Yeah, I wonder

Unknown Speaker  27:09
if we can, if, because, I mean, that's

Matthias Miller  27:13
a fundamental design question. If you prepay, should you show a negative balance? Yes or no? Yeah. Um, Dwayne, where are

Unknown Speaker  27:26
you? Do we ever

Matthias Miller  27:30
want to show a negative balance on an account if someone prepays or overpays, do

Unknown Speaker  29:14
that was literally Matthias, Sure,

Matthias Miller  29:19
but in a normal case, when they pay

Speaker 1  29:35
Balance, meaning balance, not contract, balance, right? Thank you.

Unknown Speaker  29:51
That's where all these terms get confusing.

Unknown Speaker  29:55
Yeah, yeah, so we want to.

Matthias Miller  30:00
Yeah, so we want to show a Okay, so let's break it down very simply. Here are the rules, prepayment for any fees.

Matthias Miller  30:20
Well, CRA and security deposit are effective as of entry date, pure and simple. I

Unknown Speaker  30:44
there's the entered date,

Matthias Miller  30:47
yeah, well, or the or the payment date, I don't know. I don't know exactly how it works, but basically, when you put money in, you get money out. That's very simple. Should be theoretically, yeah, and I think it's typically the entry date. All other fees are tied to a period and are incurred and are never, never, never reported in the balance. It's the later of the due date or the payment date, so prepayments never hit the balance. Otherwise, prepayments would take it negative, right?

Speaker 1  31:39
Well, you could theoretically have weird things where you paid one fee and not another, and like, if you pay forward a fee and another one's unpaid, then your balance should show the unpaid fee,

Unknown Speaker  31:54
right? Huh?

Matthias Miller  32:04
So that's why making the basis be the

Matthias Miller  32:14
be the due date of incurred fees, and then go looking for what was paid or forgiven off of that, as of the ADS Update.

Speaker 2  32:35
You remember that again, said, If wasn't quite tracking

Matthias Miller  32:41
to me, very simplistically, if we're leaving a security deposit and CRA out of the table, off the table. Go find all all periods. Go find all, all fee types and periods that were incurred, that are due on or before the as of date. And then for each of them, just look for payments made, payments or forgiveness on or before the effective date, and subtract this out, and that effectively handles prepayment. I mean, the alternative is go build a string table of due dates and

Matthias Miller  33:27
Okay, so there's always good.

Unknown Speaker  33:31
What's hitting us is that,

Unknown Speaker  33:34
like here?

Speaker 1  33:39
Well, this one would be fine. But we're we're deciding what row this pays based on period date. Which is that always the same as due date, not necessarily?

Matthias Miller  33:55
Or should it wait period date? Due Date? Yeah, probably it looks like it is here. I don't know if it's supposed

Unknown Speaker  34:12
to be typically it is. What

Unknown Speaker  34:18
happens if you shifted due date is the period date change.

Unknown Speaker  34:22
No, okay,

Matthias Miller  34:26
your next one will, unless it's a due date override, which is a whole other beast.

Speaker 1  34:35
Well, that's what I was wondering. Oh, I I'm not sure this is good for 30 Okay, stuff, I'm just stalling.

Matthias Miller  34:52
Okay, let's pick it up. So main thing that we have is there anything on the assist side? Oh, there was one thing from Mark do. I don't think this is any better on the stalling side, he was wanting, wondering if there's a way we can ignore stripe payouts prior to that. 114, one, 124,

Speaker 1  35:20
see, I'm having Sean good a job to make the undeposited funds report. Do that. That's not going to be hard. I think it's essentially

Matthias Miller  35:40
but Why would he need to do

Unknown Speaker  36:21
that's a slow

Speaker 1  36:27
Yeah, that's better. Was it? It was at like 1.7 million, yeah, that's a little better. I mean, it's essentially just this, which I want. We need to nuke as soon as the other one goes live,

Matthias Miller  36:45
right? But he wants to tie it into the dashboard stuff.

Speaker 1  36:49
Yeah, I'll send this to Nick and tell him to use, use this in the dashboard. Is that fair? Yep, that's fair. Awesome.

Speaker 2  36:59
Okay. Thank you, sir, Yep, thank you, yep, bye.
