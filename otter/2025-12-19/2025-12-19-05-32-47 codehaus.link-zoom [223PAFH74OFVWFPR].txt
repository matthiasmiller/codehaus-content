Speaker 1  01:48
Yes, sir. Hey, yes, sir, good morning. How are we good? How are you Well, sir, how's your salt and pepper look going on there?

Unknown Speaker  02:02
Linda, yeah. That's all I got,

Matthias Miller  02:05
if I let it grow out, it looks, if I got, like, a good light behind me and I let it grow out a couple weeks, it looks, it can look really white.

Unknown Speaker  02:14
So that's go for it, man, I want to see that.

Unknown Speaker  02:19
Do the beer. You need to do the like, I can't.

Matthias Miller  02:23
No, I'm not a my brother in law had good words for it. He said he's got a beard like a basketball team. He's got five on each side.

Speaker 1  02:37
All right, well, all right, and

Unknown Speaker  02:41
it's a neat, unique thing, jeez.

Speaker 1  02:46
All right, well, what do you want to do? We had some things hanging out there, didn't we a little bit yesterday?

Matthias Miller  02:57
Yeah, we did. And I, I was, I Yeah. I mean, the big thing in my mind is, can we get we get something together for The CNH pricing, and that's going to inform we can get a spreadsheet together that's going to inform what we're looking for in the system for calculating pricing.

Speaker 1  03:27
Yeah, yeah, um, had it. We met So Rick and I just finished up again. Met yesterday for a while yesterday, yeah, and we kind of was starting to get a little we were trying to going around with the overhead and whether we have a different, different price point for assembly versus, sorry, For hand versus machine. Right now he has a different he has a different labor rate on 504 a, it's a couple of cents difference on 504 B and on hand. It's it's less, and I'm not sure something like it's but again, we're catching the labor with our system, and so the overhead, what he's done is he's taken he's historically, he's taken out assembly labor, lumber, fasteners. You know, the materials out of the income statement, what's left was overhead. But the way he covered that. Was taking assembly. So he figured out a percentage, so then he would take assembly. The assembly wages times four was his overhead

Unknown Speaker  05:16
second. So

Speaker 1  05:29
which, I know you had a method. There's a method to it, but it's then, when I said when there's a an item, that's when there's a non assembled item, how do we calculate that overhead? And he didn't have an answer. Because, why? No, we're not doing a lot. I don't know. It's not a I think everything's been priced on a case by case basis. I know he has a I know he has a sort of method to it.

Unknown Speaker  06:17
But anyway, so

Speaker 1  06:23
come away from that, Rick. And I was like, let's look out how. Let's look out how the spreadsheet's going to work out the numbers and see what we have. I said, Rick, do you have a ballpark spitball number that we could start with as an overhead calculator. He's like, Yeah. He said, If you're taking sawing out of overhead and applying that directly, then he would say, maybe three times assembly labor would be a good overhead number i don't know i i think there's a better way, but I'm but we're going to have to come up with it.

Unknown Speaker  07:13
What do you think? I mean,

Unknown Speaker  07:18
what's that? I

Matthias Miller  07:19
think you're I think it's really great.

Speaker 1  07:22
I mean, just take because labor costs is going to vary, like labor cost is, in other words,

Unknown Speaker  07:34
assembly cost

Speaker 1  07:40
is a it varies based on fasteners, how much lumber, how many carts, overall item size, like those are all variables.

Speaker 1  07:55
And so in other words, some one item can have more board footage, but cost less because it's less complicated to pull. I mean,

Unknown Speaker  08:08
I'm sure, yeah, I would think that

Matthias Miller  08:14
broadly speaking,

Speaker 2  08:20
I broadly

Matthias Miller  08:34
speaking, probably what would make sense is to have a I don't know could make sense having a song overhead, like assembly overhead and then non production overhead,

Unknown Speaker  08:52
and calculate it

Matthias Miller  08:57
as a percentage on top of cost. So

Matthias Miller  09:13
when you could reduce it then to two numbers, you could take the overall overhead and share it between sawing and assembly or, I mean, just look at what is, what is a sign overhead relative to sign, I don't

Matthias Miller  09:34
know. You just need to, you need to figure out how to you need to figure out how to distribute that. Then

Unknown Speaker  09:57
well. If, if we know,

Unknown Speaker  10:05
like, if we, if we take,

Speaker 1  10:13
I mean, if you don't mind, like, look at that, that picture, that picture that I that scratch, chicken scratch, I did you mean that? Well, it's not great, but it's something like so overhead, occupancy, admin and mount did some research to come up with thought I covered it pretty well. Rent, tax, utilities, obviously, admin, non production staff and office cost, insurance, liability, workers comp, health, property, technology, it sports, cyber security, hardware, software, phone, ministers of all encompassing look at it, and then let's have a budget for technology. Man, let's create a budget for this stuff, because it's 2025 right. Marketing and Sales, let's have a budget for that. Let's have her and bake it into our overhead, yeah, advertising, website, promotional, trade shows. We don't do hardly any of that stuff. We did invest in a website two years ago. Employee costs, benefits, PTO training and development, training development, not investing in that. Transportation, fuel vehicle maintenance should be handling these come out of there, because that's, well, no, it doesn't handling and handling and forklift is overhead, unless we want to do it differently, but that's we're not catching that. Does it make sense?

Matthias Miller  11:47
Yeah, I mean, how are you going to Yeah, I would. I would tend to agree.

Speaker 1  11:58
So forklift and handling, we have, I mean, yeah, we have, I mean, yeah, we have to have some nasty overhead forklift handling. I mean, either way, we have to throw a number. We have to add a number on top of everything. So, yeah, it's a overhead, depreciation asset, wear and tear equipment, machinery. I mean,

Unknown Speaker  12:30
I guess I'm saying if, what if we would come up with a number

Unknown Speaker  12:37
for all of that.

Unknown Speaker  12:43
And then come up with our,

Speaker 1  12:50
let's say our overheads 2 million, and our sales is 10 million. How would we then apply overhead to products, to pricing. If overheads 2% of overall, 20% of overall sales,

Matthias Miller  13:16
then you just take, you take the whatever cost you come up with, and you divide it by point eight.

Unknown Speaker  13:25
You're saying

Unknown Speaker  13:29
cost as in,

Speaker 2  13:34
okay, you're saying what cost that you come up with. I mean, you would take material and labor, yeah, divided by point eight,

Matthias Miller  13:47
and that gives you 20% I mean, if your overhead covers everything that's not material and labor or not material and productive, production, labor,

Speaker 1  13:59
I think, what so? So Matt, the other lumber is typically 50 to 60% of the price in our application. Remember, we were looking at and we're like, hey, let's get it down to, you know, whatever. Let's get it below 50. Yeah,

Speaker 1  14:33
I mean, we could start, we can use, well, do you want to throw together a spreadsheet of the things that we have of cough,

Matthias Miller  14:44
let's, let's go ahead and just use this guy.

Speaker 1  14:47
Can I? Can I ask a couple questions on on reports, if I look at kind of screen share, if that's all right, I. Um, okay, did you see my text about this?

Matthias Miller  15:12
Na, Hey, I saw your text and I got it late last or I saw it late last night and I didn't was that lumber?

Matthias Miller  15:35
No, it's something that doesn't have a I machine.

Matthias Miller  16:02
Jeannie, need an answer now?

Speaker 1  16:06
Um, no, no, but I was,

Unknown Speaker  16:11
I mean, what if good?

Matthias Miller  16:15
Let me, let me shoot a note to myself.

Speaker 1  16:18
Okay, and let me look into it. Um, I'm looking at end of year today. I need to give Rick the my final end of year additional bonuses for guys on the floor. And I was trying to find, I was digging around, trying to get some report that gives me accurate data. So if I looked at, I looked at like this, for example, this was all the all the guys in assembly. And if I go by dollars per hour, um, Zach is very much like three hours. I don't know how, but he, I mean, he's, if he'd be there full time, he wouldn't be at the top. This guy's part time. Jesse, Eric was a new guy that we hired. Barry was a good worker, but he's a city kid that didn't make it. Austin Kelly, he's been there for a couple months. Steve ballers, part time's got a landscaping business. We'd like to get him in here more. Edwin and editor aren't here anymore. Mickey's the mainstay. Jerry's the rock star that fills in, runs the forklift, not stuff. So he's got 163 hours there, but for whatever reason, his scores down here. Man. Dan King's the old guy that helps out. Augustine's a forklift driver that helps out. LEO I M's on there all the time. And then Alejandra, Michael and Tyler aren't here anymore. Julio doesn't work on a machine. Usually hand work. Mel's a fill in. Yuri was didn't make it very long. Dave Miles is here four days a week. He's old, and just as you can tell, it's getting slower and slower, Curtis is a young guy that's struggling. Walter doesn't work here anymore. And then you go down to Steve real. Steve rose doing all hand work. So then down here you got your handwork guys. So I'm like, I can't, you know? I mean, here's the old, same thing. So, I mean, I I know, I know what the guys are. I talked to John T I talked to George. I can figure out that into your bonus without this. And it's pretty good. I just this helps, but it doesn't. So then I, when I looked at that other page, this guy, I'm trying to get a little more context for hand versus machine, and I'm seeing this Na, I was like, Wait, is that? Should that be part of hand station is that lumber items? That's where all my questions coming from. This one here was

Speaker 1  19:15
the same thing, different. Anyway, one was machine, I guess this was machine only, yeah, this was machine only, so the other one was wall of assembly. Yeah, it's kind of hard to it's hard to Yeah, hey, can you make another note? Um, board. Fee? Well, first off quantity is that the total amount of pallets that these guys get credit for because it's divided among however many guys work there. Yeah, hours downtime. Do. Board feet. That's total board feet allotted to their quantity. I guess. I don't know why there's hand fasteners showing up in some of these. Is that because they're also doing hand work? Or,

Matthias Miller  20:18
yeah, I would guess, if you would group it first by or, you know, group it add another grouping either first by employee and then by assembly method, or vice versa, you would get, you probably should have split.

Unknown Speaker  20:37
What's that?

Matthias Miller  20:39
If you would, if you would either group it first by assembly method, then by employee, or first by employee, then by assembly method, if you group it by both, you would probably see what's going on. Okay.

Speaker 1  20:54
Ploy first then assembly method. Okay, parts. This is adding up. I don't know that's kind of a weird one, but we'd have to get back to the score thing to really clear that up. And score dollars is that the dollars allotted to the quantity, so then dollars per hour? Yep, lumber is a percentage of price. 41 It's low. It's really low. All right. I just yeah, okay, was curious about that. There was also you sent an email, Matt, just to clear up before. I just want to make sure I get these cobwebs off my mind. Let's see you sent one about

Speaker 1  22:12
timesheet, pretty numb, oh, you caught some things that recently. Orders from November, right here, this guy, Matt, yeah, what did? What was your you just, were you just looking around and saw that? Yeah, and these are not reconciled properly, right, right. So that means John's still not catching everything.

Matthias Miller  22:49
I mean, that's what I would infer. I mean, probably we could take a deeper look.

Speaker 2  22:58
Yeah, this, well, let me go back here.

Unknown Speaker  23:08
If I go to I

Unknown Speaker  23:28
251, I'm sorry I went too Far. What's today? The 19th, 96 rows. One resolved.

Speaker 1  24:02
Should shouldn't be any on there. So, all right, what's that?

Matthias Miller  24:09
Yeah, I mean, you're right. You wouldn't think there would be, but

Speaker 2  24:17
yeah, all right, I have to walk through that many more resolve.

Matthias Miller  24:29
Well anyway, resolve is not going to fix this issue.

Speaker 1  24:37
Well, resolve to fix the issue. What's your prescription? Do you have a prescription? I mean,

Matthias Miller  24:50
fish make bad tree climbers.

Matthias Miller  24:59
Would you say? I said, fish make really bad tree climbers,

Unknown Speaker  25:07
yeah, fair enough.

Unknown Speaker  25:15
All right,

Matthias Miller  25:22
well, all right, you wanna take a look at this.

Unknown Speaker  25:25
I'm hitting it. I'm hitting it head on today.

Speaker 1  25:32
Yeah. Does it matter to you how I handle bonuses and wages and things like that?

Matthias Miller  25:46
I can't imagine that where you're at with it is going to be a big difference from where I'm at with it.

Speaker 1  25:53
So yep. So would you how much bonus or pay increase would you give to a guy like John When he's making all those mistakes?

Matthias Miller  26:19
What did you say, Well, I mean, I think it's been clearly communicated what the expectations are, right? I think it's I mean to me, well, there's been no initiative here to fix it or figure out what needs to be fixed.

Matthias Miller  26:51
So I can probably go I could probably go both ways, but if you strictly look at the facts of the situation when I don't

Unknown Speaker  27:09
know, it's just not it's

Matthias Miller  27:14
just not working. I mean, there's a lot of there's a lot of talk, and very little, little leaning in and taking the bull weather horns and fixing it and like, whether, whether, I think it's very likely, it's just, well, there's a combination. Okay, look here, here's, here's here's the question I would start from, what makes a good a player. It's self motivation and drive, which you can't teach. They have to have some of that ownership or whatever, like something, and ideally, there's, there's a skill set there, or it can quickly be developed. Obviously, there's a cultural fit, and there's also, you know, right, right seat, right right person fit.

Matthias Miller  28:32
I don't see a lot of the drive, or I don't see the initiative and the commitment to doing what it takes to get it done. There's probably values questions, and there's definitely a skill set question, and that's just and there's also a right seat, right role.

Speaker 1  29:05
Mismatch, yeah, you said the qualifying things right, which is self motivated, strong, yeah, drive, skill set. What else did you say about culture or fit? Just values fit. Values fit. Yeah, that's a big one, and then it's

Unknown Speaker  29:28
great seat. So

Speaker 1  29:35
values was never, I mean, none of this stuff was ever talked about, and so they're pushing it the resistance is, to me, leading.

Unknown Speaker  29:47
That's the resistance,

Speaker 1  29:53
including dad, including dad. So, you know. Well, I think there's still an idea there with these guys, that, because dad's still in the picture enough, they can still stick to the old ways, and the old ways might actually be better than what MERV is trying to do. And so there's still that tendency, Old habits die hard, right? Yes, so, but, um, there's a lot of pride. So like with John, he is self motivated. He does have drive. It's a ton of pride his identity. This is his identity, and his identity is so wrapped into it that he doesn't want to change because it, it, it, it feels like an attack on his identity when, like you ask him to come off the forklift more or manage differently. It's like you don't appreciate. It's never enough. But you know, so there's there is motivation and drive, there's just not skill set, you know, question definitely skill issues. Values, some issue there, but people, when people don't know what they don't know. So all I know is, this morning, I was sitting on a trainer like just like realizing that I gotta quit. I have to quit looking for anybody else's approval, and I have to I have to stop being disappointed when my dad lets me down, which he does on a daily basis.

Speaker 2  32:02
I yeah, I just have to. I have to stop.

Speaker 1  32:08
I don't know. Somehow I have to, I don't know what it is. I don't know what my problem is. I don't know why I can't I mean, I just, every once in a while getting this point, I'm just like, Darn Dad, why can't you just support me? Why can't you just, you know, validate me and voice support in front of everybody else and like, you know, but why? Why do I need that? Matt, what? Why do I need that?

Matthias Miller  32:38
Well, do you do you want the do you want the full dose? My full dose, undiluted opinion, yes. So I think we as people are habitual Idol, idol makers, and fundamentally, for whatever reason, and I don't There's nothing. There's no judgment with it. There's no whatever. It's just, there's a place in which your dad, you've turned to your dad to get approval that you can only get from God. And I think the invitation is not to stop seeking approval. I think the invitation is, what does it look like to stop turning towards for you, to stop turning towards your dad, for it, and in those moments when you're breaking down and you just won approval, what is it? What would it look like just to take a few minutes with God and lay it out in front of him? Um, and so that's that's thought number one. Thought number two, then, yep, was this? Is this? This has been a very frustrating part of my journey. But what does it look like to lean into forgiveness of all the all the things that he has legitimately, I mean, for whatever reason he missed. We're not saying why. That wasn't what may not, often not intentional, all of these types of things, but there are things that he's he missed. He's not doing. What does it look like to cultivate I don't even, I don't personally think, I think forgiveness is oftentimes a journey of finding our way towards a place that we live so that we can live in a place of forgiveness. But what does that look like

Unknown Speaker  34:53
in this context?

Unknown Speaker  35:16
What are your thoughts

Speaker 1  35:18
a journey to finding our way to a place where we can live,

Unknown Speaker  35:24
right? So it said,

Matthias Miller  35:25
Yeah, live, live, yeah. Like, I think forgiveness is almost more to me. Forgiveness is almost more like a journey to a place of abiding in forgiveness is not, it is not a singular act. It's a, it's a dying, I think it's a what? It's a dying diet, dying, D, y, I N, G, dying, yeah, you're gonna have to, daily, pick up your prize, daily, choose to forgive and yes, there will be changes that you need to make. Not saying that

Unknown Speaker  36:07
right, but yep, yep, yep.

Matthias Miller  36:22
And I would also note, I don't think there's anything wrong with you. You're just at this point of this journey, and this is where God has you, and he's he's using this opportunity to shape something in you, shape something and the people around you. I don't think there's anything wrong. I think it's

Speaker 1  36:47
just what feels wrong is that I'm praying and asking for God to bring in the right people. And I'm like, I have ideas. I know people. I know guys that could come in here and, like, just, we'd have a blast, and they'd like, I, in my mind, right, that they're the kind of people that would fit, but they're all, they all have other things, or they live other places, or they're, they're just, it's like, there's nobody else that's designed to be here right now, all the people that I wish I would like, I hear people talk about, man, once you have a team, once you have people that, like, you know, where the other guy is thinking, like, once you have that, oh, it's a blast. I'm like, That's what I want. Like, that's what I want. And for whatever reason, I'm, I've, I've, not. That's not where God has me, and that's that's hard for me to accept. Some days, really is, really is,

Unknown Speaker  37:53
yeah, yeah,

Speaker 1  37:55
yes, nothing. What is there something about the Christian journey? Well, obviously, why did Joseph have to be in prison all by himself? Why did David have to be out on the fields all by himself? Why like Isaiah and Elijah and these Jeremiah and all these people like Jesus, I mean, like just alone, like physically alone, humanly speaking alone.

Speaker 1  38:38
I guess the I know why. I mean, I know why, but it doesn't, I can't, because, you know Jesus. Everybody knows Jesus. Everybody knows about Jesus. So Jesus knows everybody. So Jesus was a community guy, right? Like he had, or, you know, all the David. David had all kinds of people around. He had his mighty man. He had wives, he had, you know, it's like, Hey, man, they weren't alone, right? That's kind of like, in my, in my imagination of these individuals, you know, Joseph, he was like, the top dude in the dude. He wasn't a dude. He was a man. He was the top. He was the top, whatever. He was a leader in Egypt, like, so you're like, Okay, he was like, he had good things in his life, you know, he had a family, he had like, life was probably whatever. He wasn't lonely, right?

Matthias Miller  39:36
Well, there's, there's a difference between being alone and being lonely, yeah, loneliness is dependent on how well you know the people around you and how well they know you.

Matthias Miller  40:02
I think, I think if, even if you know in your head that all of the greats, all of the greats, went through dark seasons that were very low, very where they were very alone in some, some way, I think all of us need I know I do. I think it's true. All of us need people. Nobody else can walk that journey, but we all need people around us to to keep giving us courage to keep walking the journey.

Speaker 1  40:42
Have she? Absolutely so. So loneliness is a result of

Matthias Miller  40:59
most times I would say, not not being known, yeah.

Speaker 1  41:13
See, the thing is, I mean, what's crazy then, is the guys that are out here, like I was going across that list of guys and saying, you know, this guy's struggling. That guy didn't make it. All these young guys and like, get him in here, and you see a smile on their face, and you see life. And you're like, you see potential. And I have fun with interviews and things, and then they're out here, and I don't interact with them much, and it's just like they all go down this like not all, but most of them just kind of, they just fade. They just kind of die. It's almost like, it's almost like their life is they're bored. And, you know, like, they almost, like, all of a sudden they don't even, I'm like, Man, how you doing? And like, there's just no like, and I'm like, what are they mad at me? Like, do they feel like I'm not, like, I don't care about them anymore, or, like, how are they feeling? And they're just like, there's just, like, no life there. There's like, no energy there. They're just putting in time. And I'm like, and it bothers the crap out of me, man, because I know that's the very thing that they're dealing with.

Matthias Miller  42:40
You. With so is that because, okay, I heard somebody say, there's a story of this person who worked in accounting, she was a bookkeeper or something, and somebody was talking to her, and it's like, Oh, I'm so sorry. Like, that's got to be the worst job. Like, you're just dealing with numbers all day, and she's like, No, there's never a dull moment. Like there's so much interesting stuff that goes on and which is unfathomable to most of the world. The question that we have with these guys, the person that you want working back there. They should be very hands on, not an abstract thinker like you don't want somebody who's who's constantly, I don't know, daydreaming or whatever. You want them to live now in the present. They should be somebody who who enjoys routine and consistency and like, that's what makes them come alive. And you do kind of want the person who, I mean, hopefully they have they can set their ego aside, and they know when change is uncomfortable and and when they have to learn. But they just, they just and to do things better, but they really do just like showing up at the same time every day and doing the same kind of thing. And my question would be, in your interviews, are you, if you're strictly hiring based on how well you connect with them, then you're likely to pass by some of the people who would do really well at the job.

Unknown Speaker  44:30
Like, just a thought.

Unknown Speaker  44:42
Yeah, that's interesting. You don't

Matthias Miller  44:47
have to agree. I mean,

Unknown Speaker  44:50
no, it's good thought.

Unknown Speaker  44:54
Yeah. So well.

Speaker 1  45:02
I've kind of, I've kind of, like, tried to bring in people best, like people that I that seem like they can get work done. And, you know, have some energy and, you know, have some talk to them about values and some of that. But then again, it's like, I don't, I'm not the guy that's teaching them. I'm not the guy that interacts with them here. And it's like, it just feels like I'm kind of a bridge, and then they're and now they're over on the other side, and you know, they're their experiences now, based on how the supervisors and the other workers interact with them, it's kind of out of my control, and I know that it's Not what it could be, it could be, it could be much better. And so then I'm, I want to, I want to work on the making that better. Because I can't chase I can't chase them boys down hardly. I do try to interact. And I do interact with them. I try as much as I can, you know, just small little ways and stuff. But, and I do some of the I jump in on some of the things that the guys aren't, the supervisors aren't doing, like, just in a small way, but just Yeah. So starts with the leaders, man and I, that's where we're at, and this is where we're at with this whole situation here too.

Unknown Speaker  46:50
So all right, Thanks for looking. All

Matthias Miller  46:58
right. You want to take a look at this? Yeah, would you do more on any of this stuff here?

Unknown Speaker  47:07
What's that is, George, cleared up. Do you know I need to

Matthias Miller  47:14
make the changes that we talked about yesterday? I think I mean, whereas I from my state, for my state, manage point, I think so, yeah, but I mean, we still need those adjustments from the lumber versus can stuff,

Unknown Speaker  47:33
yeah. So,

Matthias Miller  47:41
can you see my screen? Yeah, maybe.

Matthias Miller  48:10
Is this the 55 cent number?

Speaker 1  48:15
So Rick's adding five cents. So he's at 58 right now. What?

Matthias Miller  48:22
What's why the five cents? What's that? Why is he adding five cents? Why the five cents?

Speaker 1  48:32
So he's adding five cents for curve,

Unknown Speaker  48:39
which is not enough.

Matthias Miller  48:45
Do you want to we started talking about this when we left, but or yesterday. But, do you want to calculate curve more specifically, or just want to do curve overall? I

Unknown Speaker  49:04
to be a lot easier to do it overall,

Unknown Speaker  49:12
yeah,

Speaker 1  49:21
if we do it overall, though, percentage see, well you but remember how we talked about like, curve is the is the width and the thickness of The lumber, the length needs to be calculated by the increments that we can get out of 810, 1214, 16, well. Well, we can add the curve. Yeah, we can add the curve as a one time. A fell swoop.

Unknown Speaker  50:03
Wait, but doesn't this

Matthias Miller  50:08
doesn't, doesn't sizers. Don't. Sizers account for this, like we already have these calculations of what comes out of where.

Speaker 1  50:19
I mean, yeah, if you go by, the cans, like we talked about yesterday, if you go by, then you have the curve.

Matthias Miller  50:33
So then we can just do the straight lumber cost. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  50:51
how is you've given me a 55 cent number, or 58 cent plus there.

Speaker 1  51:00
Well, our lumber cost, yeah, we, I think 55 is a good starting point, if we catch the curve, if we use the can size and not the lumber size, you know,

Matthias Miller  51:22
now there is, here's the one issue with that is that really, to get accurate pricing, though, on the can't size, you need an average order quantity, because you might, if you build 100 you're going to use, You're going to have, likely to have less waste than if you go one,

Speaker 1  51:54
right? So sorry, but say you say that one more time if

Matthias Miller  52:01
we we need to calculate for the average quantity, or, you know, the average quantity that we're going to be producing if we want to use canned board feet. Because if you the can't calculation currently is going to say Not, not, unless we come up with a can't price per linear foot, because the can't calculation literally is how many cans do we need to get these, this specific pieces of lumber out

Speaker 1  52:35
and right? But I guess I'm saying, use the board foot cost as the calculator, and instead so like the 11/16 where you get seven out of a six inch, then you calculate it as such. You know,

Unknown Speaker  53:07
like, I mean, like,

Matthias Miller  53:10
so you use these calculations to come up with a curve, but you don't literally, you don't literally calculate the can't, number of cans times board foot per can't. You calculate

Speaker 1  53:25
you're saying to get the total board footage right? No, you just I calculate the lumber plus the curve that is in each piece of each item. Right? So like, for example, inch and 1/16 by three and a half, they're right below the can't measures three and a half by six. So you calculate it as three and a half is the full height dimension, but inch and a 16th, I'm going to get five of those out of a six. So that's a 1.2 count instead of a 1.0625

Unknown Speaker  54:13
Yeah, that makes sense.

Speaker 1  54:16
Now, if you if we bake it that way, we have curve covered. And then if the thing measures 45 we call it 48 and that covers the can't cost now, now we're passing the full lumber cost to the customer. Now we could go back and say, what is the what percentage of lumber overall IS curve and to that point, yeah, I don't know. 13/16 we get six out of a six out of a six inch. So we lose a. Lot there. I need to get that. I was trying to find that paper. I have a paper with those numbers on it. Just not it's got to be in here somewhere. Yeah, yeah. I anyways. I

Matthias Miller  55:23
um, I mean the bottom line is, this is, this is, this is lumber board feet with curve.

Unknown Speaker  55:34
You mean that 55 number?

Matthias Miller  55:36
Oh, I mean this number here we need to get the Yeah.

Speaker 2  55:42
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

Speaker 1  55:49
Now if we or it'd be easier, you know, just to go by the item data, and excuse me, add curve to the thickness as a percentage, what's that? It's

Matthias Miller  56:08
divided by Hang on, I almost have it

Unknown Speaker  56:19
minus one. I one. What are we going to on this first one?

Matthias Miller  56:26
845, 845, yeah. So if you take this with, if you take the can't take the count the board feet of the No, it's, it's like, well, that's all the same. Anyway, take the take a one. Really. Take the thickness times width of the can't divided by the thickness and width of the lumber divided by the quantity of the can't to get the percentage, the curve percentage,

Speaker 1  57:14
well, you don't have to multiply can't, like multiple cans. You just have to look at a one.

Matthias Miller  57:23
Well, I mean, there's five going, what I'm using is there's five, five of the lumber going into the can't I mean the other way to do the math, or there's two ways to get to the math.

Speaker 1  57:42
If you go to the that spreadsheet you have with dimensions, I can give you the curve number that that happens on all of these thickness. The curve is on the thickness. It's not on the height,

Speaker 2  57:56
on the height. Gotcha now,

Speaker 1  58:01
like, yeah, the two and 13/16 there. Sometimes that'll come out of a three. There you go. There's your, oh, you have it right there. Yeah, you have it right there. Man, does that look great? Yeah, heights and width of the can is height and width of the lumber, or what we call thickness and width. Yeah. What am I saying? Yeah. So go back. Sorry.

Matthias Miller  58:28
Sorry. I want to, I want to turn into a percentage. Go ahead. I just

Unknown Speaker  58:31
want to look at that again. Then why is there? Can't quantities there?

Matthias Miller  58:39
Because this is you can get 213, 16, three and a halfs out of a three and a half by three.

Speaker 1  58:47
Okay, but why is a curve percentage, 84 in that situation?

Matthias Miller  59:00
Well, because 13 sixteens is less than I mean, you should be able to get three, and we're saying you can get two,

Speaker 1  59:10
we don't have three and a half of threes. I'm not sure where that's coming from. I

Speaker 1  59:24
Where does that three and a half by three dimension come from?

Speaker 1  59:32
Is that a job? Somewhere? I

Unknown Speaker  59:50
This guy. What is it?

Matthias Miller  59:53
Sorry, publishing a c2 palette,

Unknown Speaker  59:58
okay, oh. Um, this guy,

Unknown Speaker  1:00:08
that's not, that's a mistake.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:12
What the What should it be? Three and a half by six.

Speaker 1  1:00:23
Yeah, that would you want? Well, yeah, yeah, sorry, I don't know. That's just a typo.

Matthias Miller  1:00:30
So and then in that case, we don't, we just

Unknown Speaker  1:00:38
Okay, so I see this

Matthias Miller  1:00:40
guy, so this guy doesn't, so then we don't need this guy. We can delete this guy.

Speaker 1  1:00:43
But that can't quantity. Matt, I'm not what is the why is there a number? There of quantity of can't

Matthias Miller  1:00:51
lumber, number of, okay, we're mapping from here's the can't. If you have a can't size of this and a lumber size of this, how many pieces of lumber can you get out of the can't

Speaker 1  1:01:02
exactly, so yes, I got you. So if it's a three and, yeah, that should be a three and a half by six. But yes, makes perfect sense.

Matthias Miller  1:01:10
One of the this realistically would be three. I mean,

Speaker 1  1:01:13
yeah, well, let's get rid of that guy that's like, and then that other one's like, an eight by three,

Matthias Miller  1:01:21
okay, but an eight by three, it says you can get a five, three by eights out of that. Well, that's, I don't know how you're doing that, what?

Speaker 1  1:01:28
What's, that's a weirdo too. That's a typo, too. What I don't get?

Speaker 1  1:01:42
Oh, we're not using it all right. Get rid of it. Eliminate those things. Let me

Matthias Miller  1:01:54
should I go through and

Matthias Miller  1:02:02
basically, could also be on work orders

Speaker 1  1:02:05
in six by four. I don't know what, where that comes from, either. It's just weird, six by four,

Unknown Speaker  1:02:16
New Holland that's just by four,

Speaker 1  1:02:25
six by four? Well, it needs to be four by six, at least. We don't use six, but, I mean,

Unknown Speaker  1:02:34
we have, I mean, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:02:36
that needs to be changed to four by six.

Matthias Miller  1:02:40
Why can't I do? Why is it not letting me do? Because we don't have a we don't

Matthias Miller  1:02:57
have a two by four out of a four by six,

Speaker 1  1:03:02
which should that be? Well, I guess that is a full two inch by four inch, I guess is what they're trying to get there for that one job. Apparently it's a go up there. What's the item? Again, it's just a lump. It's a non assembly item, is that right? Yeah, but why is it coming out of a four by six by four? Why can't it come out of a four by six?

Matthias Miller  1:03:32
Because we and Matt on a four by six, need to say that a two by four,

Unknown Speaker  1:03:41
it should be a, can we change that? Like that?

Speaker 1  1:03:50
Oh, thickness was four and width was two. Is that? What it was?

Unknown Speaker  1:03:55
Thickness is two, yeah, width is four, fine. I don't know why,

Unknown Speaker  1:04:03
why it's coming out of a six by four.

Matthias Miller  1:04:06
I mean, we can switch it to a four by Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then we can get rid of, yeah, yeah, just double, triple check, okay. And then we can get rid of the six by four.

Speaker 1  1:04:19
We're getting hung up here in these weeds. But, man, that's weird. I don't know why that these what? That's just weird.

Matthias Miller  1:04:27
Okay, two by six, one for one, yeah,

Speaker 1  1:04:32
three by six. Wait, you can't get two, two and threes, but three and a half out of a three by six. What is that about?

Speaker 2  1:04:40
I It

Unknown Speaker  1:04:44
doesn't make sense either. Can we look at that item? Jeez.

Matthias Miller  1:05:00
How important is it to get the CNX pricing today?

Speaker 1  1:05:11
I don't know. I don't have a quick answer. Well, this is the last one that I'm seeing. I mean, three and a half by six is what we use a lot of

Unknown Speaker  1:05:20
Did you well?

Matthias Miller  1:05:23
It's Armstrong and not alone.

Speaker 1  1:05:33
By six, two and three by three and a half, three by six. What's it? What's the out here? Let me write that down. What's that item number? Matt AR, 508

Matthias Miller  1:05:48
a or 508 what's the other one? Met one. Metal. Yeah. Metal. One met 1m, E,

Speaker 1  1:05:58
t1, okay. Got it? Okay. Let's go back to that. So, yeah, the curve is so now I'm okay, Matt, the curve as a percent, 45 is not an accurate number. Like, I'm sorry, but what is 45 45%

Matthias Miller  1:06:15
Curt, no, that's no, that's so how do you know? Because sometimes we invert the length and the width, right? So if you,

Speaker 1  1:06:30
how do you mean, invert the length and width? So this, this here curve. The percentage of curve is three and a half times six, whatever that measure. So 3.5 times six is 21 right? And then the next number is 3/8, which is point 375, times 11 is 4.125 Wait, yeah, 4.125, that's not right, not right, that's not Right. Point 375, times 3.5, 1.3125 times 11 is 14.44. 18.44

Unknown Speaker  1:07:25
So Mike, the curve is, how did you come

Matthias Miller  1:07:29
to that? 3.5 times 11?

Speaker 1  1:07:33
No, no, no. 3.5 times six is the can't dimension. Yeah, square of square inches, right 21, square inches then 3/8, 3/8 times 3.38 times 3.5 is point 375, times 3.5 which is 1.3125 now if they get times 11, because you're getting 11 out of that, so that adds up 14.44 squaring inches. And the can itself is 21 square inches. So now I got to take 21 minus 14.44 equals 6.56 divided by 21 my curve is actually point three 1% it's actually 31% okay, you take the

Matthias Miller  1:08:29
you're basing it off of kerf is a percentage of the can't, not a percentage of the lumber, or is it a percentage of the lumber?

Speaker 1  1:08:36
Kerf is percentage of the curve, is the percentage of the can that does not end up in lumber form. Got it

Matthias Miller  1:08:47
that makes sense. So and,

Speaker 1  1:08:52
and some like, they're inefficient. Like, there was the one there it said three and a half by five. Well, you're cutting a three and a half by five out of a three and a half by six. So we both know that we're losing one out of 6.375,

Speaker 1  1:09:13
but that, um, yeah, there's a lot of kerf on a three eight. There's a lot of curve loss when you're cutting 3/8, on a gang. So Holy Moly, and the 7/16 is point six. Anyway, point 437, 5.4375.

Matthias Miller  1:09:37
You said point 3125, is that what you came up with?

Speaker 1  1:09:41
The one you just did point 375, is three eight.

Matthias Miller  1:09:45
No, I meant the third percentage that you just echoed.

Speaker 1  1:09:49
I forget what it was, something like that. Yeah, I think so, 6.56 divided by 21 Yeah. Point 31245, yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:10:00
Yeah, yeah, yep, okay, so

Unknown Speaker  1:10:04
yes, Yeah, makes sense,

Matthias Miller  1:10:07
yep. So then here we got one where it's like, I

Matthias Miller  1:10:20
I guess we could turn This into a percentage then,

Unknown Speaker  1:10:32
well,

Unknown Speaker  1:10:41
yeah, point two, seven,

Speaker 1  1:11:07
Matt that curve, that that percentage,

Matthias Miller  1:11:16
that's a lot, yeah, some of the if You do this, I mean, this one's just wrong, whatever that thing is. But you start looking at these,

Speaker 1  1:11:31
well, I don't know, we don't have eight by three. I mean, that should be three by eight. I don't know what that's about. That's a typo to

Unknown Speaker  1:11:38
Hello, hey.

Unknown Speaker  1:11:44
Yeah, just take a message. Okay.

Matthias Miller  1:11:48
Well, I have to, I need to drop, I need to get to the office for, okay, recall, man,

Unknown Speaker  1:11:59
we keep running into this.

Speaker 1  1:12:03
What's that? Um, where do I look at that? Man? I want to look I don't know if I can. Yeah, sorry. I have other stuff to do to let me know

Matthias Miller  1:12:17
what's good for you. I've got some flexibility.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:21
Well, I was figuring on 10 o'clock again. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:12:25
sounds good, yeah, I'll try

Speaker 1  1:12:28
to, I'll try to wrap my head around. We need to try to get through this a little bit. But dang comment, chucks, yep, all right, Matt, thank you. Yep. Bye.
