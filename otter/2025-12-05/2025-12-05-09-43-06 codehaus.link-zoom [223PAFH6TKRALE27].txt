Unknown Speaker  00:44
Morning Matthias.

Unknown Speaker  00:50
Morning frozen Matthias,

Matthias Miller  01:22
Okay, now let's try that. Let me try switching over. Oh, there you're

Unknown Speaker  01:28
Did you see my signal message?

Matthias Miller  01:36
My frozen face?

Unknown Speaker  01:38
Yeah, now it's

Unknown Speaker  01:40
it is really glitching in and out.

Matthias Miller  01:45
My camera is not connecting.

Matthias Miller  02:01
There we go. So random tidbit, that little monitor stand was my latest addition. It was my latest that was my Cyber Monday purchase from my office, one cord and open desk space looks looks cleaner. It's actually at a usable level. If I want to throw something on there. Is dumb that $40 can create so much peace, joy and happiness. But anyway, that's great. I've been obsessed over simplicity and decluttering and organizing, and it's just been wonderful. I should have you

Speaker 1  02:43
deal with my desk. Actually, I should just have my wife come and clean up my desk. I just get it gets messy.

Matthias Miller  02:52
Yeah, yeah. Anita has been slightly shocked at the types of cleanup I've been doing. Who is this man and where has he been all this life?

Speaker 1  03:09
Good, okay, I'm thinking, what's gonna be most productive is just quit going through making sure we have product changes. I was working on that some, but I think I was seeing a couple made yet. And then we can look at the ones that I was thinking were priority and make sure they actually are, yep. So I was just on the contract record. It looks like so cash and check refunds, we're saying are January right?

Matthias Miller  03:37
Cash and check refunds are, yes, I believe so well, I thought we did we see? Was it December? I kind of think it was December. But the truth is, in the proposal, it says, it says January, January deliverable.

Unknown Speaker  03:53
Does that mean?

Matthias Miller  03:55
Well, what does that mean? Yes, that's right. No, that is January. That is correct, because, okay, December street only, yes.

Speaker 1  04:04
So I'm going to just drop that down here. The January section is going to need to be cleaned up at some point. It's sort of, yeah.

Matthias Miller  04:11
I think basically, as soon as we can get everything tidied up in December, we turn around and start ranking. Yeah, exactly.

Speaker 1  04:19
So this is cash and check refunds. This isn't really a To Do, SAS kiss it.

Matthias Miller  04:34
Which one is that it's just like, that's still the cash and check refunds. I mean, we need to, well, I think we need to you, and I probably have to talk

Speaker 1  04:41
through a little bit how to design it. Okay, I'll leave that on. Be a tag for us to look at it. Yep, I don't want to get into it right now. If we're

Matthias Miller  04:50
not needing, no, it's not No, it's not

Speaker 1  04:53
other fees. I wasn't quite understanding what you're going for here. Okay, like it felt like we went on a tangent. Basically, we're not needing to add other fees.

Matthias Miller  05:05
Well, I mean, not, well, not for December. Anyway, you can only add the bottom line is, the only fees you can add are the explicit fees, fee types that you've set up, and you might need to add those at some point through next 30, right? I think it's documented somewhere that was arbitrary fee, right?

Speaker 1  05:22
Okay, that's what we were, that's what I was asking about. How do we add those other the fees from the contract definition?

Matthias Miller  05:29
Ah, it's an X, I believe it has to be an X 30 button that prompts for the fee and the period and and the and the amount, and

Unknown Speaker  05:43
we only allow adding it to existing periods,

Matthias Miller  05:50
assuming we always have one in the future, I would think so. I mean, I mean we basically should,

Speaker 1  05:57
yeah, I think so. I think as soon as we cross the end of like, if we're on nine four, I don't know if we'll create another one. We need to figure out when we do that. But for sure, if we hit nine five, then we create the 10 four row.

Matthias Miller  06:12
Yep. So this is January, though,

Unknown Speaker  06:15
yep. So that go. I'm

Speaker 1  06:34
right? So that's out of our hair for now. Overriding due date Nick has. Nick just added a field for number of days. Oh, I should. I might want to reword that, but it's if it's non blank, then the due date will be why is the due date?

Matthias Miller  06:59
It'll be incremented. Yeah. Great. Now we can push quote, quote, free cash to accounting. Good, awesome,

Unknown Speaker  07:08
does day Inc was a, we need this guy

Matthias Miller  07:16
an A to zero. Yeah,

Speaker 1  07:20
I'm gonna just, I'll add some test on there. I'm not going to just, we'll fix that then. X, So forgiveness is something I don't know that I have written,

Matthias Miller  07:32
but we don't need that until January. I know we've written up forgiveness somewhere as a as a PC, oh, not as a PC. I'm sorry that was yeah, okay, okay, but it's, it's January, okay.

Speaker 1  08:04
Okay, overriding due date is that also a January piece?

Matthias Miller  08:11
Well, that's pretty cool, though. The only hesitation with no, I think we only hesitation is import them. Yeah, we're almost going to need it to sync up due dates. I don't know what happens if they Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  08:24
I think when you want

Unknown Speaker  08:27
it, why are you crashing?

Speaker 1  08:33
Oh, because I was trying to demo a crash for Janelle, and that's why, and I didn't prefer it. That's funny. Did you know that if you have a field on a that's on the detail screen, but is not a valid field, catalog update crashes

Unknown Speaker  08:58
instead of just Bailey, yes, yes. Oh,

Unknown Speaker  09:01
he said it's been that way for a long time. To fix it or not.

Unknown Speaker  09:09
That's funny. That's cool.

Speaker 1  09:11
So that was interesting. Find yesterday by Nick he was so confused. I he also had forgotten about broadcast at txt, so he was afraid his system was toast as like, Well, did you delete that and say, Oh, no, perfect.

Matthias Miller  09:26
So I felt like exactly.

Speaker 1  09:33
The funny thing was, literally, like, two hours after he had it. I've never had it crashed before, like that. I did it myself by accident. That's funny, the odds are not high, okay? I think we want the next due date,

Unknown Speaker  09:52
yeah, word. I think so

Speaker 1  09:54
January, or for December. Where's my sane? I. I have way too many tabs

Unknown Speaker  10:06
on tracks. So what I'm

Speaker 1  10:12
going to do is I'm going to at least set a end date of 1231, or target date, and then we can, I can get them, and then we can prioritize from there. I like it contracts play next to date on Main Street, that gives me enough to put it on that sky. Do? Do I've been doing to do Kansas sometimes, I don't know if that's wise, but makes sense. Overriding due date is basically done. We need to handle this part. Do you want to handle the override for earliest paid only, for earliest unpaid period now, or does that happen later only?

Matthias Miller  11:10
Well, how do you manually override at this point? What's the human process?

Speaker 1  11:17
See, and I guess I don't even know for sure if Nick has built a way to do it humanly, or, if it's just you, we need to add an import. Yeah, probably, yeah. I think we need to add an import yet.

Unknown Speaker  11:32
What should the process look like?

Matthias Miller  11:35
Well, wait, why do we have to only allow an override for the earliest unpaid period? Like, why couldn't we?

Matthias Miller  11:45
Why couldn't you just arbitrarily choose a period and you defer that in all future ones? What am I missing? You could if you have late fees,

Unknown Speaker  12:01
what do you do with them?

Unknown Speaker  12:05
Do you just forgive late fees if you move a due date?

Matthias Miller  12:09
Well, why wouldn't we just say? Could we just do the earliest one without any late fees? Well, see, I'm not convinced you have to do the earliest one. I'm not sure why I said that. Just add all periods and then just have the x 30 fail or something fail if it has late fees. And say you need to remove the late fees first before moving the period the due date.

Speaker 1  12:37
So overriding a due date affects all future periods as well.

Matthias Miller  12:42
Yes, yes, you should update all future ones. And then when we add a new period, we should copy from the latest period. What the override is,

Unknown Speaker  12:55
make sense? I'm sorry, you're gonna turn that by making,

Matthias Miller  13:01
well, whenever we add a new period row, we need to grab, I mean, we need to set that to that value to whatever it's been, which value the num days overrides. Oh, okay. Otherwise, it'll reverse. The next were you thinking it's increment? Ah, you think it's yes, Delta.

Unknown Speaker  13:27
I was thinking, if you say the upcoming period is due

Speaker 1  13:35
due tomorrow, the sixth of December, then you override that period to be do the 10th of December, and then the next time we just come through and we calculate our next period date by the last due date plus payment terms.

Matthias Miller  13:50
You just need to make sure that when you do a negative to move it back, that you can't minus it less than the thumb coming out to zero. Yeah, that makes sense. You can't, you can't move it forward three days, but you need to be able to move it back three days, but not four. I mean, you can move it forward three days, but then in the future, you can't, you can move it back three

Unknown Speaker  14:18
days, but not for Oh, I see. So in that way, then it would be simpler to use the number of days until due,

Matthias Miller  14:29
like, every period, it would just say,

Unknown Speaker  14:35
like, we have this many more. Or whatever it's

Matthias Miller  14:52
I'm not sure if I care that much about

Unknown Speaker  14:58
which way it works.

Matthias Miller  15:03
In some ways, it would show for each period. I mean, it's a little weird. Well, okay, it doesn't matter how it's stored. You can always create a macro to get the opposite value right.

Speaker 2  15:23
Make sure that they can't be moved prior to what the auto calculated due date.

Unknown Speaker  15:42
Then and are you thinking we just have a button

Matthias Miller  15:47
to move it? Yeah, X dirty button

Unknown Speaker  15:50
again and just in here. Or do you want a main screen?

Matthias Miller  15:58
I'm gonna I was assuming that we would have it on the main screen that for things like forgiveness and moving due dates would just be buttons on the main screen. You don't really care how it works. You just need it to work.

Unknown Speaker  16:09
I thought into main screen would it be move current due date or change current due date,

Matthias Miller  16:23
adjust due date. Maybe. I don't know if it has to be that. Like I said, I don't know that it has to just be the current one.

Speaker 1  16:30
Well, then how do you select? Are you thinking? You just select from a drop list of periods that aren't fully paid?

Matthias Miller  16:39
Yeah, or an upcoming period

Unknown Speaker  16:46
which would but can you change your due date on a period that's been paid?

Matthias Miller  16:51
No, no, we're, I'm sorry. You're, I misunderstood. You're correct.

Speaker 1  16:55
Select from droplets of incurred, unpaid, unpaid can partially paid, partially

Matthias Miller  17:02
you could have you can move it on, partially paid.

Unknown Speaker  17:15
All periods following the move.

Matthias Miller  17:19
Period must also be mixed. Be missed.

Matthias Miller  17:34
Do decide whether you always store

Unknown Speaker  17:42
or tell store number days until due or

Unknown Speaker  17:45
update period or story later period.

Speaker 1  17:59
Okay, so this one I have tagged for 31 so we'll for sure get that time.

Unknown Speaker  18:10
I also tag now.

Speaker 1  18:27
Right? We've got those guys the to do permissions. Do we When do you want the damage waiver? Well, we can talk about that when we get to it. Actually, I have it actually, I have it listed somewhere else. Oh, I think I might. I

Matthias Miller  18:47
mean, we don't need to move Damage Waiver stuff until January.

Speaker 1  18:59
Sales tax. That's sales tax. Do we need the liability? RG, for the liability? RG, functioning for December.

Matthias Miller  19:21
Probably the liability being what we paid the state, what we owe the state, or owe the state, yes, independent of the events. RG, correct. I don't believe so. I'm assuming for December, we'll be filing based off of RTO Pro.

Unknown Speaker  19:42
Okay, so then this guy should be January, I think. So

Speaker 2  19:59
let's. Be so we've got a Do we have sales tax to suit somewhere else?

Unknown Speaker  20:14
Yeah, here we have it for

Speaker 1  20:22
January. Do remaining functionality we have the RG there, it's just not doing anything yet, functionality for liabilities, RG, reporting or filing taxes.

Unknown Speaker  21:00
Who's allowed to edit sales tax fields? I

Unknown Speaker  21:03
think probably specifically these ones.

Matthias Miller  21:07
Everybody for December figured out in probably February, we're running wide open.

Speaker 1  21:17
Yeah, I'm going to put the note in the in the January sales tax one for now, and we can bump it down then I've left. Or are you leaving to do permissions in January, in December,

Matthias Miller  21:31
I was just too lazy to clean them up. But, you know, I'd be, I'd be very happy if Sean would go through and move them all down later. I mean, I I've just been ignoring them because I've been lazy.

Speaker 1  21:44
Okay, okay, sales tax, we're good on I think macros. There's a couple for Sean to add. I just had to just start listing macros, because you keep asking for them. I thought it'd be easy way to keep track of them. Yeah. Well, again, due date calculations. This is not, this is January. Yeah, right,

Matthias Miller  22:03
the floating due date calculator. I mean, I would, I would make this, call it floating due date calculations. And yes, that's a January, or, actually January. I'll put

Unknown Speaker  22:12
it in January for now, and we can, let's move it.

Speaker 1  22:22
Okay? Then EPO calculus. This is documentation which we need to clean up EPO some stuff yet.

Unknown Speaker  22:33
Here's a job for Sean that I think I have

Speaker 1  22:37
targeted on this one linking events to auto pay. Are we doing auto pay in December

Speaker 3  22:50
in any form? No, no. We could have just bumped the whole thing out, but

Speaker 1  22:56
we've got a lot of it developed now. So that's worth something. Yeah, it's, it's not, yeah, it's not at all wasted. Yeah, I'm

Matthias Miller  23:07
gonna bump the priority as well.

Speaker 1  23:10
And I'm going to just straight up move that down. This is largely, I think, largely in place we need to. What we need to put in place yet is the actually incurring the payments. Or, I guess incur is not the right word, but you know what I mean. I think

Matthias Miller  23:31
triggering, yeah, yeah. Payment.

Speaker 1  23:49
That's a picky little thing I can go clean up if it's wrong, linked invoices and linked contracts we need yet.

Speaker 2  24:00
Yeah, that'd be good.

Unknown Speaker  24:07
Wait, we don't support paying invoices, do we?

Matthias Miller  24:11
No, actually, we don't. So that could be,

Speaker 1  24:14
what about contract payment rows that we might want?

Matthias Miller  24:18
I would assume, if we're importing that, we're going to be able to say, hey, what were you paying on here? Although, conceivably, it's a diagnostic tool that would probably be useful, but

Speaker 1  24:33
essentially just a filtered Well, we're not, I don't remember if we have the linking working right.

Unknown Speaker  24:42
Payments, yeah, yeah.

Matthias Miller  24:44
It's, it's not, it's not a difficult it could be a useful diagnostic report. That's the bottom line. We can pull up the view payment, or we should be able to pull up the payment. Whiskey, yeah.

Matthias Miller  25:08
I'm going to just move it to change. That's fine, and we'll add it easy at it

Unknown Speaker  25:15
exactly. I'm

Unknown Speaker  25:30
this is happening?

Speaker 1  25:42
Are we wanting to manufacture the paid manufacturer premium amount is this December, January?

Matthias Miller  25:50
I would say January. December. We're only looking at read only access January. We're looking for editability. We will probably gonna have to start splitting January into and these timelines are actually more phases than anything. But, yeah, but I would almost like to have a, I don't know, first half of December, 2 half of December, or a early January, late January. Display.

Unknown Speaker  26:26
So I'm Going to add I'm

Unknown Speaker  26:45
Action Can

Unknown Speaker  27:20
I Have

Matthias Miller  27:39
that a between a mouth and products.

Unknown Speaker  28:00
Okay, I'll go clean up. So

Unknown Speaker  28:14
what are you thinking for cash collected section?

Unknown Speaker  28:20
You mean for timing,

Unknown Speaker  28:23
or timing? Well, both.

Matthias Miller  28:35
I mean, you can ignore the 1020 comment. Yes.

Unknown Speaker  28:45
But is the rest of this? Then,

Unknown Speaker  28:50
where is the rest of this?

Matthias Miller  28:54
I think it's man. I hope I'm not being too aggressive with this stuff, but I think it's January. It's not like you have to, not like we have to be able to see this. Now I think we're going to have a fair bit of work mapping RTO PRO data into, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  29:12
that sounds right.

Matthias Miller  29:16
That's actually going to eat up a lot of design time for me. Probably, yeah, I would think so,

Speaker 2  29:23
okay, good, yep,

Matthias Miller  29:31
we should have a I don't

Unknown Speaker  29:35
know what this should be. I don't

Matthias Miller  29:41
know where all we need this. Maybe I should wait. We're going to need RP source linking IDs on our core records. Yeah,

Speaker 2  29:54
makes sense anyway. That'll be soon.

Matthias Miller  29:59
That'll be soon. In some ways I'd almost be nice to so we need it on I mean, we need it on customers. We need it on products. We need it on on contacts contracts, instead of not customers, products, contracts. And what I'm not sure

Unknown Speaker  30:23
on contacts other than customers,

Matthias Miller  30:28
potentially, employees, potentially, but I can't remember importing them or not. I'm not sure about what I'm not sure about is event rose, probably we should add it to event rose, and potentially depreciation rose, I don't know if we need depreciation rows. No, that doesn't that doesn't have to happen. We can link that. I think we'll just link that off the parent and then payment records.

Unknown Speaker  31:07
You said you don't need depreciation risk. I don't think,

Speaker 2  31:14
well, no,

Matthias Miller  31:22
it would probably be easier if we did, if we let's just add it, and if we don't need it, we don't need it. And then the question I would have is, my instinct would be to tie it to so we have a silver LOD or something on these records and use that as a linking field. Is there any response? Right? Why not? No. Otherwise you have to do it. NDX, yeah, exactly know

Unknown Speaker  31:49
that I like that good Link. RP, source records.

Matthias Miller  32:10
This, I'm going to leave that. Let me just spec a little more for Shonda code.

Unknown Speaker  32:27
This is probably a fairly

Unknown Speaker  32:31
soon I'm going to guess, ideally,

Speaker 1  32:36
it'll make it much easier to work on that stuff. Okay, payment, product. It's like one or two tiny things for me to do. Well, there's a question about resale, buyback. We don't have this built out in any form. I don't think so. Should I move that section, or do we need it?

Matthias Miller  33:07
How do we Okay, currently, what will do we have on there? We've got method commission.

Speaker 1  33:15
Actually, I think we might have a bunch of the fields question mark, but we haven't built them out, or haven't we hit them?

Matthias Miller  33:22
We definitely don't have commissions. I would. I'm afraid that we're if we're going to import any kind of buyback or resell data, that we're going to run into trouble. But I don't know what if we did A i

Matthias Miller  33:47
A mission, dollars override,

Matthias Miller  33:56
target amount

Matthias Miller  34:02
I've think we need method

Matthias Miller  34:13
and we need amount off of the potentially we don't need target amount. We need method and an amount paid that pulls it off the invoice and

Matthias Miller  34:37
and a new invoice, or a new slash view invoice. And I would start by that, and I think,

Unknown Speaker  34:50
can you have a new invoice if you're already linked to an invoice?

Matthias Miller  34:54
Possibly, I mean possibly, if you

Speaker 1  34:58
I mean, first off, no, but in the future. Your potentially right?

Matthias Miller  35:02
It seems, seems unlikely that you would need it. I don't know why, but why does the why do we care? The only reason why we care about, okay, on the invoice, don't we have options for a reseller buyback? We're going, we're going to, what I'm wondering,

Speaker 1  35:34
move that to it's for here.

Unknown Speaker  35:38
I think, I for

Speaker 1  35:42
product, purchase, premium and expense.

Matthias Miller  35:45
That's a bill. That's where we're getting it. Wait, that's bill, so for a manufacturer. So here's my instinct, actually, on this now that we're wandering around the the bush, but the, I think the invoice, I think instinctively, I would say that we don't need to store the method that we need to show the buyback, the buyback value, the buyback The target buyback amount and the target resell amount with a new invoice between each one, the buyback would always go to the manufacturer, and the resell would leave it blank, or potentially default to the current customer. I don't know what makes the most sense, and potentially to be determined, we might want to indicate on the invoice whether it's a buyback or a resell, and we will probably end up needing to, but it makes more sense to denote that on the invoice, to say what, what are you doing to it than it does,

Unknown Speaker  37:01
I guess

Matthias Miller  37:04
maybe I don't know enough. But the bottom line is,

Speaker 1  37:16
I guess here's the other question, go ahead in the voices when we're asking someone else for money, correct? How does that work with buyback? Because how is buyback not a bill?

Matthias Miller  37:31
Is the buyback not a manufacture? Your does that your data? I'm kind of doubting myself, but isn't it a manufacturer buyback so it gets repoed or something, and the manufacturer says, Oh, I'll take it back and we'll resell it somewhere, and they might sell it for cash price. Gotcha.

Speaker 1  37:50
Okay, probably I was just trying to figure out so it one product will either be a buyback, in which case manufacturer just takes it back and pays you, or a resale where you re put it and now you're gonna probably start another RTO contract. I guess we don't know for sure,

Matthias Miller  38:10
but probably right, probably, but it would have to be. The biggest difference is when the manufacturer by the back, they get it at a better price than when we sell it to a customer. That's, I feel a little out of my league, but that's, that's what I think, deeply enough so. But the biggest thing we need for December is to be able to record purchases of it, and we have ways to tie invoices to products,

Speaker 1  38:40
which I think we really need to look into to make sure they're mildly sane, right?

Matthias Miller  38:50
Well, what do we have right now? We have a cash sale revenue account, but that's on the selected row.

Unknown Speaker  39:00
I mean, it's like a transaction,

Matthias Miller  39:07
cash sale revenue account. I doubt that the cash sale revenue account should actually be we should literally put the account on here. I would think it should be something more like, Hey, thank you. I think it should be something more like,

Matthias Miller  39:29
you know, buy back or resell, like more like a category. Oh, awesome. Sorry, 2475,

Matthias Miller  39:48
I think, I think, I think that I'm not convinced this should be, I think the cash sell revenue account should potentially be.

Matthias Miller  40:05
It's weird to tie this straight out to an account here, but maybe I'm just being

Speaker 1  40:09
I think we just told. Did what we were told, but maybe we just misunderstood. No, you

Matthias Miller  40:16
did not misunderstand. Okay?

Unknown Speaker  40:24
Yeah, this is what we did,

Speaker 1  40:28
list of income accounts. So you're thinking it should not be an account, not a literal account,

Matthias Miller  40:40
right? I'm thinking it should be some kind of revenue category,

Speaker 1  40:51
gotcha that we map across from the accounting company. Then, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  41:06
do we have any? We

Matthias Miller  41:09
don't have anything like this. Okay, it'd be on a product, or it'd be probably under the product. You'd have,

Speaker 2  41:22
um, I even know,

Matthias Miller  41:35
well, it's almost like the what was the list that we had that was resa versus buyback? I It's almost like that list that we expect out.

Unknown Speaker  41:50
Not sure if we actually have it anywhere.

Matthias Miller  42:00
Product, resell methods. It could

Matthias Miller  42:09
almost be like a product revenue type or a okay,

Unknown Speaker  42:15
it's literally a list of resale and buyback. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  42:31
I think does not exist. Yeah, or product invoice type or product I don't know.

Unknown Speaker  42:56
Okay, I'm getting stuck.

Unknown Speaker  42:58
So where do we need this for?

Speaker 1  43:02
What do we need to field to make the data coming in from RTO pro say,

Matthias Miller  43:18
we don't know. I it Okay, let's do this. The only thing we care about at the moment is we need to be able to indicate that a building is no longer in our inventory by some form or fashion. So where should that be on the contract? No, not really, because you might sell it to some it to somebody who's not on the contract. Great, but that was easy. You store it on the product record and say, this thing's been sold. Actually, I think that makes sense. So this is going back to where we were, and so really the only thing that you need is, I think you could almost, if we never invoice anything for building except for the sale of it, then I think, I think you could just nix the financial account for the for the time being, put it in its own child job, in case we want to get ever Get it back quickly and I have a field on it, or where you have a building, a sold date, which then requires a method, which is the buyback versus the buyback versus resale.

Unknown Speaker  44:48
Method, buy back, resell.

Matthias Miller  44:53
Okay, first you have those a sale, a sale date they're sold on, which is a date that makes everything else visible.

Matthias Miller  45:08
Method which becomes required. You have a you have a well, not now down the road we have a target resell and buyback amount, but then you have a sale amount field,

Matthias Miller  45:35
yep, and then you have a

Unknown Speaker  45:41
so not tight invoices for now.

Matthias Miller  45:43
Well, then, then you, then somewhere, I think, have an invoiced amount that's calculated off of invoices,

Matthias Miller  45:58
and a view and a new i And technically, the news only needs to be visible if there's a non zero balance,

Unknown Speaker  46:14
as in the sale amount is not equal to the invoice amount. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  46:36
This is what we're going to go with for

Unknown Speaker  46:39
now. Yep, awesome. I love it.

Speaker 1  46:44
What do you call the section? Because it says to label based on on method. What do we call it for now? Or if you don't have specified you just leave it as resale slash buyback, either we have

Matthias Miller  47:02
purchase financials. Well, how does this not go into cash collect? Oh, that's going to be cash collected, sale of product. You

Unknown Speaker  47:18
want to just keep it called that.

Matthias Miller  47:20
Just just call it resell buyback. You don't have to differentiate, okay, or whatever it says, And then everything else can be figured out. At least in January, we need to rationalize anything

Speaker 2  47:39
else. 31 for Now I

Unknown Speaker  48:03
this we have already

Unknown Speaker  48:24
Okay, so that gives us

Unknown Speaker  48:27
That for products.

Unknown Speaker  48:35
And then We're going to add bypass, you

Speaker 2  49:13
I hate how glitchy this gets. We were talking

Matthias Miller  49:18
with starting with Ellis yesterday about switching these out into separate records, one per section, oh, with a dashboard to navigate two sections at a time, S and then copy, paste, move, move, save, save, boom, done.

Unknown Speaker  49:33
Oh, man, that'd be amazing.

Matthias Miller  49:39
Good. Okay, well, there's a rabbit hole, but that was a rabbit hole. Depreciation.

Speaker 1  49:48
Nick has started on how much of this needs to be in place. Good. I think he's got a fair bit of the structure. He doesn't have the logic for the different something else.

Matthias Miller  50:01
Think as long as we have the structure, I think this can be January,

Speaker 1  50:05
getting the logic needs to add the RG for depreciation amounts, because we're going to cash when you set depreciation, we were going to cache the rows, yep. So he needs to add that, and then the maker's schedule as well, I think he needs to add.

Matthias Miller  50:23
But for the import, all that we're looking for is read only with

Speaker 2  50:33
Sure, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  51:02
and get the did the

Speaker 1  51:10
Did you talk with Duane about renaming product to asset?

Matthias Miller  51:14
No, but let's bump into January. It just doesn't it has no functional

Unknown Speaker  51:21
benefit at the moment exactly, and I

Matthias Miller  51:25
would even argue it could potentially go further down than that, because the only reason We need it is for asset management and accounting. I

Unknown Speaker  51:53
Wow, it's so slow,

Matthias Miller  51:57
it's and it's not getting better.

Unknown Speaker  51:59
Now it's gonna get worse.

Unknown Speaker  52:20
Um,

Speaker 1  52:27
I think I'm gonna, can I just move this whole section down here? Not quite sure what? Because I think we have the structure basically in place. I don't want to just copy paste this and not sure. I want to wade through figure out what's what. It's fine.

Speaker 1  53:02
Yeah, I mean, s3 setup needs to happen too. Is that a that actually December,

Matthias Miller  53:10
very likely, because we'll likely be importing, or we will be, I have to check with him, I think we might be importing the I

Matthias Miller  53:25
uh, sorry the I can't speak attachments from back.

Unknown Speaker  53:44
Message Nick about that job. I'm

Unknown Speaker  53:57
going to create an s3 I'm

Unknown Speaker  54:04
whose plate is, would that

Unknown Speaker  54:06
be on? That would be, that would be

Matthias Miller  54:09
Josh's. It would go to Josh.

Unknown Speaker  54:13
Okay, and I can we want a PC for that.

Matthias Miller  54:22
No, just shoot an email. We do this. Josh, do

Speaker 1  54:56
okay, I mean, we have a. If you get him that email sent that I have all the jobs

Unknown Speaker  55:04
that, not that we need for December, think I mean more things might come up.

Matthias Miller  55:16
Alright, so can you, can we now take a look at this project management Do we have a project management report we can look at now? I can

Speaker 1  55:23
look at now? Yeah, I think we want

Unknown Speaker  55:27
the best way to look at it. Is it the

Speaker 1  55:32
hierarchy or by I want to get it to the point where we can look at it by target. I think I might need to add a couple target dates to because this one Dwayne said he doesn't care if we have yielded but not supported features. So,

Unknown Speaker  55:55
hey, so

Speaker 1  55:56
dwf in events, RG gets bumped to January, right

Matthias Miller  56:08
now when we need ASAP.

Unknown Speaker  56:15
And these are all dates on so we can, are we

Matthias Miller  56:21
able to use priority for could we put everything in January? You went 26 January?

Speaker 1  56:29
I'm dropping to, can't edit from here though. I've been dropping to three or four, good, because I don't want them here. I would think this is a keep accident entering one, 125, and it doesn't want

Unknown Speaker  56:53
me. This guy's

Unknown Speaker  57:02
guys have three,

Unknown Speaker  57:10
and that one's

Unknown Speaker  57:16
that I need to spec. All right, so now

Speaker 1  57:21
we have some dev started ones we need to wrap up then. So wonder if I could, I wish I could edit the estimate for how long it takes, because that might give some sense.

Matthias Miller  57:36
It's just why people always do save as

Speaker 1  57:40
exactly, actually, is there any chance there's a

Unknown Speaker  57:46
what's dev estimate?

Speaker 1  57:50
Oh, there's also a PC priority, editable.

Unknown Speaker  57:56
Look at that. Where did I you? It was status. Yeah, it's instead of status.

Speaker 1  58:17
Why does it have to be available to all it does? It does uncheck

Unknown Speaker  58:27
There we go. I think I'm gonna actually just nuke status, and it doesn't give me as much detail, but that's all I need, really,

Matthias Miller  58:44
yeah, hey, Dev as estimate is editable, nice,

Unknown Speaker  58:53
which, what is it?

Matthias Miller  58:56
Is that? Is that not the,

Speaker 1  59:00
I don't know, yes, estimate hours. I mean, that looks perfect, if we're using this report,

Matthias Miller  59:08
exactly what we're looking for.

Speaker 1  59:12
Okay, so this is entry types on bills. I can't do a partial hour, fine, it's

Unknown Speaker  59:29
one hour. I mean,

Speaker 1  59:33
how should we should I be expecting hours like for my time? For what do you think? Um,

Matthias Miller  59:45
I would what if we did like Nick hours, which means could be more than you and less than Sean? Yeah, I. It's useful to have a general basis at least. Yeah, that will

Speaker 1  1:00:13
be a few that would be a little bit, because it'll take figuring out exactly how to display it, but I think we just pull think we just pull from the events. RG, be selling, buy back.

Matthias Miller  1:00:28
It's actually pretty simple. This is just fields. Well, it's fields and some reporting.

Speaker 1  1:00:34
Yeah, I'm gonna say two. Okay, do you think that's what do you think?

Matthias Miller  1:00:39
I think two is a little bit, I don't know. Okay, well, three, but

Speaker 1  1:00:43
I'm gonna fly through and put stuff on and then we can go back Seth's wrong.

Matthias Miller  1:00:47
Well, I don't care if Seth's wrong or not, I'm gonna do budget low. Okay, go ahead. Sorry. You're gonna do it. I'll probably, you're probably right. I'll tend to budget a little low. I am also disconnected from the day to day, so that doesn't help. What were you gonna say? Let's just keep going and well I was gonna say. What I was gonna say is that if we can actually compare, if we can compare actual versus versus estimate, then yeah, it'll help

Unknown Speaker  1:01:23
you, this guy,

Matthias Miller  1:01:30
contract entry process. I mean, that's not your job. Paper contract values. That's That's our job to fit through. I'm not sure about that. It doesn't this. I would

Speaker 1  1:01:48
this is where this is a job I created when I was getting scared.

Matthias Miller  1:01:53
Okay, you should, but all this stuff is design stuff, not development. I would argue you should close this out, put in the proposal for us to deal with.

Speaker 1  1:02:01
You want them. I mean, I think most of them, well, not all of them. Like this one is actually development, but I have a PC for

Unknown Speaker  1:02:07
it. Okay,

Matthias Miller  1:02:11
this one's you, we've done that already. We've done contract entry. I mean, you can check, you can say we've did it, paper, contact, contract values, yeah, we need to do future values frozen at the perfect time. That one probably actually is

Speaker 1  1:02:27
you, not us. That is me. This is, I think this is essentially done. It's contract definition stuff,

Matthias Miller  1:02:36
balloon payments. I don't know.

Speaker 1  1:02:38
Balloon payments and down payment are both in the air.

Matthias Miller  1:02:43
But I think down payment is in our court through contract entry that you could, you could take off. It's, it's actively in the section right now,

Speaker 1  1:02:54
and floating due dates is future. I mean, I think you're right. I can just viewed with Matthias. Five parts are handled or written elsewhere. Design items are

Speaker 1  1:03:15
so this is written, these we both know about, and they're written up paper contract values. Do we?

Matthias Miller  1:03:21
Do we have? It should be in the

Unknown Speaker  1:03:24
Sure, perfect, sure, and this, we have a whole theme for as well, good.

Matthias Miller  1:03:38
I like not having this open ended, weird do something or other.

Speaker 1  1:03:50
Link to Rp, source records. That's going to take a little while between the different ones. It's not

Matthias Miller  1:03:56
but not terrible, just adding the fields,

Speaker 1  1:04:00
oh or No, report links to open them.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:05
Is it screwed down?

Unknown Speaker  1:04:07
No, it's I need to spec it.

Speaker 1  1:04:14
Okay, so I think it's going to take me 30 minutes and then it would, it probably wouldn't take Nick two and a half hours, but something, you need to add fields, and then you need to add auto push reports. This guy's really just the placeholder job. I'm gonna drop it to

Unknown Speaker  1:04:35
us. We have, like, a workflow of placeholder or something. I

Unknown Speaker  1:04:46
because all the child jobs are, they have everything,

Matthias Miller  1:04:53
okay, literally, okay, let's go. Can we go through dev started? Yeah.

Speaker 1  1:04:58
So this is Jonathan. And Customer Portal, I think, is pretty static right now. Take a payment. He's just chugging away on, I mean, okay,

Matthias Miller  1:05:09
external user authentication. This is barely care about,

Speaker 1  1:05:12
really, yeah, framework, Nick said he put that at the top of his to do list. He's close to them. There's just a few pieces to clean up.

Matthias Miller  1:05:21
And then is he? Is he deferring calculations? Or does that also get us calculation?

Speaker 1  1:05:26
No, that's not calculations. I told him that we just need framework for now. So how many written up?

Unknown Speaker  1:05:33
Can we put hours on it

Matthias Miller  1:05:36
like he has point three hours now? Three, six days.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:40
That's days, so eight, three hours so far.

Matthias Miller  1:05:53
So we think, okay, yeah, I don't think there's much left. Basic reports is basically done, isn't it? I think so.

Speaker 1  1:06:01
Let me just paint Sean. Sean basic reports are, is that job done? I'm going to just mark it ready for review.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:13
So I'm trying to keep the queue clean. And if you find one that needs to be added yet, just do it then import. Where's imports? At?

Speaker 1  1:06:31
Imports he's working on, and he's having trouble with some of them, so he's going to pull Jonathan in to look at it. Okay? This is my placeholder job when I find random things to fix while I'm okay. So I will just leave this guy open calculations. We should review that together. I think getting closer automatically adding event rows were close again. I just making some changes with sales tax, and

Matthias Miller  1:07:04
we should consider we're automatically adding event rows. We should consider having a date where we never add event rows prior to the system switch date. Oh, yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:07:23
And then this could technically be referred to January, okay, or later in December, okay.

Speaker 1  1:07:37
So, I mean, I think I could, I I mean, I already did some work in here, but you're saying most of this we don't need right now, right? So I'm going to contracts automatically add event rows. We're going to have this as a three with a 131, 26 for now, and I'm going to make this the parent to this guy. You want the system switch now? I think it'd

Matthias Miller  1:08:15
be useful so that we could start importing without getting it cluttered up.

Speaker 1  1:08:18
I'm going to create another child PC contract. I think I'll just do a fast code in myself, add systems which keep from adding automatic demand for those. And I'll do that

Unknown Speaker  1:08:40
early next beginning of next

Speaker 1  1:08:43
week, unless I spec it out and send it off to someone. So then this guy, like, close, I

Matthias Miller  1:09:08
think it's time to set up the deploy system

Speaker 1  1:09:15
to Okay, so I got that guy out of my court, but we decided it's time to work on that stuff again. Tax.

Matthias Miller  1:09:22
One question, yeah, is RTO or is RTO pro in a separate catalog? Yes, awesome. Love it. You need the import. Pull the catalog the way it goes.

Speaker 1  1:09:34
Yep, we have see. Oh, I mean, if you pull the import, then you lose all the records. I mean, pull the catalog. Oh, it's fine. Once we have it in, then we're fine.

Matthias Miller  1:09:45
Once, once you're live, you're good, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:09:49
yep, no, we have that.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:56
I have a few things with tax handling. X amount for forgiven rows.

Matthias Miller  1:10:06
Can we just look at the contract record a little bit? Can

Speaker 1  1:10:23
so right now, what I'm what we're doing is for cashing tax amount for the paid rows and auto calculating for the incurred rows. And should we be displaying? We should probably display the rates for Pedro's,

Matthias Miller  1:10:43
I would only display the rate if it's consistent, and I would show overflowed or something similar, if it's maybe I'm overthinking if it's if it's inconsistent or multiple

Speaker 1  1:10:55
you're saying so I'm sorry. Are you saying to not show it? Were you talking about incurred or Pedro's?

Matthias Miller  1:11:05
There, incurred? Well, what? Sorry, were you talking incurred? Rose, I

Speaker 1  1:11:11
was talking Pedro's. Oh, I'm not. We are not storing the rate on Pedro's, and right now, I'm not displaying it in any way,

Matthias Miller  1:11:21
because the payment is calculated off of Okay, hang on. How are we?

Matthias Miller  1:11:35
We are calculating the okay. We're calculating payment times rate and then saving that value, right? So the individual payment is the source of truth for how much tax. I mean, it seems saying to me that we would show the rate, well,

Unknown Speaker  1:11:55
isn't it actually saying to literally cash it on the

Unknown Speaker  1:11:58
row? Yeah, it is. What do we well,

Speaker 1  1:12:04
no, because what if they change? What if they realize it was wrong? Then, okay, yes, we paid the wrong amount of tax. But we need to have a we need to auto calculate for liability purposes, right or no? We calculate liability based on incurred no

Matthias Miller  1:12:21
payment. We're saying that we calculate it based off a payment.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:26
I mean, but if it's wrong,

Matthias Miller  1:12:34
technically, that's a case where you should say, I still paid the same grand total. Well, no, but the customer, if you told the customer, I know. No, this is where, this is where we get to. If the tax goes up, we just eat it, and if the tax goes down, we give it to the state or the Yeah, if we, if we tell the customer, it's tax, and they pay it and we owe less than that, we can't give it to the state, or we can't keep it or keep it to ourselves. Yes, we have to give it to the state. Have to give it to the state. If it goes up, then we just eat it. Is the idea.

Speaker 1  1:13:10
Yeah, what should the frame? I get confused on what the actual fielding should look like then,

Matthias Miller  1:13:25
okay? For reporting purposes, we need to know that as of this date, we incurred this amount of liability in this jurisdiction at these rates for this amount. Right? So?

Speaker 1  1:13:43
So that we store that's linked out it will be cashed into here,

Matthias Miller  1:14:02
and because we do it on save,

Unknown Speaker  1:14:06
we're not doing it yet, we're

Matthias Miller  1:14:09
going to infer jurisdiction based on the the event date. And what I was,

Speaker 1  1:14:14
yeah, and if so, I was thinking the paid row. We don't cash anything other than the amount of tax we paid.

Matthias Miller  1:14:23
Wait, you are cashing the jurisdiction on here, on a

Speaker 1  1:14:27
Pedro I am on a row because we don't have the RG right now. We have a zfp style

Matthias Miller  1:14:40
eight fields. Why on the why not cashing it on the paid

Unknown Speaker  1:14:51
we had this whole huge conversation

Unknown Speaker  1:14:52
about it. I'm sorry.

Unknown Speaker  1:14:56
I thought, if I can find it, i. Are we chat?

Speaker 1  1:15:05
GPT agree that tax rate is based on when the payment has incurred, not when the payment is paid. Okay?

Matthias Miller  1:15:10
Thank you. No, that makes sense. Fine. I got confused between flip flopping that yes is sounds correct. Okay. But what is the issue? I understand what the issue is. I'm sorry. I'm feeling very obtuse at the moment. We're storing,

Speaker 1  1:15:29
restoring tax. What I'm what I'm doing right now is I store the jurisdiction and rates on the incurred row, which is what we had agreed on, right and then on a paid row, I don't store anything except the dollar value of what I of what tax we collected.

Matthias Miller  1:15:50
And we're assuming right, because we're assuming that the rate is the rate of the incurrence, which is absolutely correct. So, yeah, I guess what's, what's the issue now, yeah, it's

Speaker 1  1:16:06
the only thing that I'm not sure on is we talked about doing, being able to go in and change the rates on an incurred row,

Unknown Speaker  1:16:16
in which case

Speaker 1  1:16:18
we just, we would just update the liability and this row. Are we fine with this row staying the same? The dollar value, if they would look at the incurred row, wouldn't really make sense.

Matthias Miller  1:16:30
You would have to. What you'd have to do is, what I would

Unknown Speaker  1:16:36
probably do is the

Matthias Miller  1:16:38
like, is there a way we could I can't figure out how to structure this so it's not weird, but you would, you would have a paid rate or tax tax or paid tax rate and paid tax amount, and then to the right, you would have a calculated tax or actual tax rate, actual tax amount, and then you would have a discrepancy, tax discrepancy, or tax underpayment. Slash overpayment.

Speaker 1  1:17:12
Okay, and the paid rate? Do you want to cash the all the jurisdiction details when you pay? Or can we just cash the total rate.

Matthias Miller  1:17:25
Well, I don't even know if you have to catch the rate. Maybe you don't even need to do that rate. I suppose. I suppose it would make sense

Speaker 1  1:17:35
to freeze that. I think it does that number. I'm afraid if you try to reverse calculate, then you're going to get weird, off weird.

Matthias Miller  1:17:46
Okay, that's fine by cashing it, but we do not need to cash jurisdiction, I

Speaker 1  1:17:50
don't believe just cash, just cash, the sum combined rate correct.

Matthias Miller  1:17:56
Now, okay, let me know. Let me know when you're ready for a frustrating question,

Unknown Speaker  1:18:02
no, not until next week.

Matthias Miller  1:18:07
Well, I mean, genuine, genuinely, we can defer it. But the question is, what happens when, when we well, when we calculate the tax, do we need to handle any kind of rounding

Unknown Speaker  1:18:27
such that

Matthias Miller  1:18:31
when we get to the or, Okay, hang on, when we when we calculate the tax amount? Are we summing all rows to get to that tax amount. So that rounding is cumulative, or are we rounding each individual payment, which means that if you have multiple payments, you'll end up with a with a discrepancy.

Speaker 1  1:19:02
I was thinking we're try to handle it similar to what we're doing now for zfp. So when we calculate liability, we sum all rows for that set of O, oh, that's hard.

Matthias Miller  1:19:20
So the options are one, when you go to file, file based on the actual paid amount for paid periods.

Unknown Speaker  1:19:37
Option two

Matthias Miller  1:19:39
is, have smart logic in your tax calculation, such that you look at all historical payments plus this payment. Well, you group payments together by rate. So look at all the 7% payments and all the seven and a half percent payments. Get the totals on each one you. And then take the take yourself out of it, and look at the difference and apply that tax to yourself. No, it's simpler than that. That's kind of dumb now that we think about it.

Speaker 1  1:20:12
Go ahead. Do you need to, don't we need to know jurisdiction,

Unknown Speaker  1:20:20
right? So all

Speaker 1  1:20:22
that, it's fine to just pull jurisdiction from the incurred row, though. So when we create our rows and we just for a payment row, you say, Oh, my row, the jurisdiction is this, and this is, that's very simple. No, it's

Matthias Miller  1:20:43
pull all paid rows,

Unknown Speaker  1:20:46
yeah, jurisdiction rate,

Matthias Miller  1:20:51
just the rate is all we need, the active current rate.

Speaker 1  1:20:58
No, I think you need jurisdiction because if, if they change the jurisdiction,

Matthias Miller  1:21:04
we need to know, because the period is all under in one jurisdiction.

Matthias Miller  1:21:19
If you change jurisdiction, you're changing the entire periods jurisdiction, right? And we're and we're saying, If you collected it for the wrong jurisdiction and the rate changes, that's your fault. So so you don't have to worry about jurisdiction, you just pull all payments, plus the new one.

Speaker 1  1:21:40
Okay, when you're saying all payments, you're saying all payments for the period. Sorry, for the period. Get the all the payments for the period, plus this one. I'm sorry. Okay, that makes sense,

Matthias Miller  1:21:51
times the tax rate equals subtotal. Take yourself out of it, all the historical payments, times the tax rate, and then up to use that as the as the taxable amount, yeah, and then, okay. But then here's the weird thing, if tax rate drops when we go to report liability, effectively, what we need to do is we need to include all customer overpayments

Unknown Speaker  1:22:28
in our liability.

Matthias Miller  1:22:41
That's weird. I know I'm a little worried, because how do you represent that?

Speaker 1  1:22:55
I don't know, because you can't really set the taxable subtotal there. You're just saying we have, we over collected tax. That's

Matthias Miller  1:23:09
not a problem to solve now it's, it's a problem to know. Yeah, exactly, yeah.

Speaker 2  1:23:33
It's tax. Do

Speaker 1  1:23:42
think figure out design, or when

Matthias Miller  1:23:53
a rental company over collects tax. I

Unknown Speaker  1:24:05
Okay, so there's some things for me to do here, to change.

Speaker 1  1:24:18
Well, no, it's going to be pretty simple. I I have logic here where I'm splitting it out. I can have a stored field already. I'm just gonna display that as the paid amount, yeah, display the Calculate, yeah. We do need to start calculating the paid or start cashing the paid tax rate. I have not been doing that, sure, but that's that's pretty simple, and I'll just fill it in to Evan for everything. I think, well, I'll do a little bit of stuff, but not much. Yep, make sure it's some a. Semi sane. Okay, okay, so adding a couple columns here. This isn't going to take me long. It's going to be okay. We're not handling it for free. I haven't done stuff to make it work well for forgiveness, but we don't cash a tax amount for forgiveness. We just show a calculated tax amount, right? And that just updates based on that's saying, that's easy. It'll be automatically handled. It will be automatically handled. This is also SPECT below. Boom, I like it. Okay, so I had spent point one seven hour and a third that's going to go up to two hours.

Unknown Speaker  1:26:11
Okay, calculations I have how much time on this job. This is one

Speaker 1  1:26:19
that we need to just wade into at some point. I Okay. I have some work I can do to clean up balance. I think we might want to just look at it and say, what are the macros we want to be using, and how do they work? I just get myself some of the future stuff. I was getting really confused. Yeah, yep, this guy's whatever working on.

Unknown Speaker  1:26:59
Just throw that on there for now, I'm not sure I don't care about Jonathan's here,

Speaker 1  1:27:19
because I think I have work left here ready for review. Is there might be a couple dev inputs on those. They might take a little longer, but shouldn't be bad. Okay, so we have the

Speaker 1  1:27:38
bills to the menu. This is probably not hyper urgent, but it'd be nice to have. I mean, we want it for Yeah, you should prioritize the big pieces and then fill in from there, probably

Matthias Miller  1:27:59
bigger urgent. Yeah, well, yes,

Unknown Speaker  1:28:03
entry types. Do we actually need this for December?

Matthias Miller  1:28:14
It's manufactured, potentially reporting product purchases and premiums. Yeah, we need that to show

Unknown Speaker  1:28:25
this is more work than I gave you credit for.

Speaker 1  1:28:29
So, so that's one of the bigger ish pieces. Is four hours something. It's this field, it's not terrible.

Matthias Miller  1:28:43
No, it's not terrible. You're missing the accounting company changes.

Unknown Speaker  1:28:52
What were we wanting? Company? I

Unknown Speaker  1:28:55
thought there were two. I

Matthias Miller  1:28:58
thought there was somewhere I had spent. I thought I expect out either product, purchase, expense account

Unknown Speaker  1:29:06
or a talked about it today. I don't know that we remember seeing it anywhere.

Matthias Miller  1:29:17
Is it for sure, an expense account if you buy a product, not necessarily it would be an expenser and asset account, probably.

Unknown Speaker  1:29:34
You just have it be,

Matthias Miller  1:29:38
just have it be an account, and don't filter for now.

Unknown Speaker  1:29:44
Oh, we did talk about the you did talk about it. You just said based on the accounting company. So we need to add.

Matthias Miller  1:30:03
If premium, we have a we have a premium expense account, we have an inventory or in a rental asset account. We just need to notate that. So, okay, do

Unknown Speaker  1:30:23
product purchase.

Unknown Speaker  1:30:27
So you're saying that's the rental assets account? Yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:30:43
let me close manufacture. Okay,

Speaker 1  1:31:13
inactivating contract definitions is that fairly key?

Matthias Miller  1:31:18
Seems to me it's adding a checkbox, changing some reports and help, changing helper list. It seems simple to me, but you know,

Speaker 1  1:31:35
so which of these are you thinking is going to be big?

Matthias Miller  1:31:40
Well, I would I wouldn't go big. I would go, what are the urgent ones? RP, sync.

Unknown Speaker  1:31:50
I had that set for next Monday,

Matthias Miller  1:31:52
resale, buyback, potentially overwriting, due date. Ad system, switch to keep from adding events

Matthias Miller  1:32:10
and entry types. I

Speaker 1  1:32:15
want to just clear there's so many due dates, it's okay. So you said resale, buyback and RP source and then system switch to keep from adding event rows. Yep, that's one I can knock out pretty quickly. Overwriting due date, I

Matthias Miller  1:32:35
think we'll need, and I

Speaker 1  1:32:36
put that at mid week next week, that's going to be a that's gonna take a little more work in design

Matthias Miller  1:32:45
and build entry types.

Unknown Speaker  1:32:59
Okay, so that's, that's

Matthias Miller  1:33:03
what I need. But we look at, it's 22 development hours. Do you know what, where we've been averaging?

Speaker 1  1:33:15
I mean, Sean is pretty booked yet with import stuff for now. I'm not sure how much that'll take him yet. Oh, last week was slower because of thanksgiving. This was a we were hammering it more this week. Jonathan's booked on whiskey, so can't use him. Nick has been lower on CRT. He's He's planning to ramp it up.

Matthias Miller  1:33:40
But like, even you guys are averaging maybe 15, conservatively, if you refresh your report, we got 22 hours of work for to wrap up for December. We could literally have December work wrapped up by Thursday.

Speaker 1  1:33:52
Well, okay, it's 23 here. Plus, what do I have? I think this is going to be a good chunk yet. And this is another hour, maybe not public by not

Matthias Miller  1:34:04
an hour, okay, but you only have a one, three hour job on this, plus specking. So again, I'm not saying this is true. I'm not saying this to push you. I'm saying based on the numbers that we have and how we've estimated it, we should still be able to you're gonna, you're gonna struggle to probably get all your stuff done, and maybe to spec what you need to but as far as development capacity, yeah, there's a theoretical possibility what needs to adapt in my expectations and thoughts.

Speaker 1  1:34:34
I think you're probably right. I know we always end up having more other jobs coming through than we expect

Matthias Miller  1:34:42
is what it feels like other from us or from no

Speaker 1  1:34:49
elsewhere, yeah. So I think we I need to keep learning how to just say we are budgeting this amount of time. Nick is taking more of a design role. So that's taking. Making a fair bit of load from him, so he's been lower capacity. Yeah, I think we can push. I mean, I think you're right.

Matthias Miller  1:35:09
Okay, so let's, let's make it comfortable. Okay? There's also this understanding that insight is coming, like end of year is, is pushed by definition, it is. They got stuff, they do have to get it nailed down before the end of the end of the year, yeah, or one two, as much as possible. And early next year could be crazy too, but we could conservatively say based on the workload,

Speaker 1  1:35:34
I mean, at the worst two weeks, at the worst two weeks.

Matthias Miller  1:35:40
And so then we're, we're into Christmas

Speaker 1  1:35:42
then, yeah, exactly. And I'm out the 15th, driving to PA. Should be working 16 through 19, okay, but then out Monday, Tuesday, but that's like Christmas week. So Christmas

Matthias Miller  1:35:58
week, all right, so here's what I think we can send Dwayne a message.

Matthias Miller  1:36:15
Okay, so Seth and I believe that we can reasonably get, okay, there's the zero, the imports the RTO PRO data, getting it in, which is good bit on me, but get the December list done in the next two weeks. Focus for you and I are wrap up the last details in the spec for December. Figure out how to map RTO PRO data across and spec out the imports and actually probably just mock up the endpoint, wrap up the last details here, across the mock up the imports, and then what was the last thing? Oh, I

Unknown Speaker  1:37:38
good. Do you agree? Okay,

Unknown Speaker  1:37:53
yeah, I think so.

Speaker 1  1:37:57
And I want, I think we're going to want to do something like this as we get close to wrapping up December, then to get a ballpark or game plan for January. Yes, stuff like this helps a lot. Man, I can do it. I should keep learning how to do it more on my own, probably. But no, it feels like it's easier to do a call like this, yep.

Matthias Miller  1:38:24
Well, I would, I would I? There's so many different philosophies on this type of thing, but I know there's a lot of stuff. It's a combination of things. So lack of gaining experience, sometimes it genuinely is helpful to have somebody else bounce things off of I have context around priorities that you don't have, so it's not just any one factor. All right, okay, so it is lunchtime, yep. Do you want to break and what do you want to do for investor tools, stuff,

Speaker 1  1:39:10
we should probably circle what? How much time do you have before

Matthias Miller  1:39:13
that call? I mean, I'll just be if I'm not working with you, I'll just be working on other stuff.

Unknown Speaker  1:39:19
I would take, like a 20 minute break, and then

Matthias Miller  1:39:22
could hit it. Okay, let's do that. Okay. Sounds good. Okay, stay in 22
