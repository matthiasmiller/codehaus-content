Unknown Speaker  01:01
Or that you those? All right,

Matthias Miller  01:06
let's start in. I've got a static export of my first of all backup, yeah, I think we're supposed to hit the 60s day, and I can't. I stepped outside and I could, let's go.

Speaker 1  01:18
Yeah, no, that makes sense. I'm in PA, and it is about 30 degrees. There's still snow on the ground. It was beautiful when we came in and you came in. Thankfully, we had no snow, except for the well, no snow on the roads, except for the last like 10 miles, which was amazing. Otherwise it could have taken much longer than it did.

Matthias Miller  01:45
No kidding. Well, my parents in law stayed home from church in Delaware because of snow. So I don't know how far west it went, but yeah,

Speaker 1  01:57
I mean, there was only, there was maybe a half inch to an inch here, it was enough that it covered everything, but it wasn't lots. It's already largely melted.

Matthias Miller  02:05
Largely melted. Offensive means it's slightly better prepared than Delaware,

Unknown Speaker  02:10
I think, but that's fair. Oh, good fun.

Speaker 1  02:17
Okay, all right. Mark just emailed me, said he and is telling me that they have a Harris Sparrow at their feeder, which is something that I see 10 of every day in the winter in Kansas, but it's like a bird that there's like one or two of in the state of Ohio every winter, like it's rare, and he's got their eight year old son noticed it at their feeders when he was hunting house sparrows. He's like, there's a different Sparrow. And he went and figured out that it was a Harris' Sparrow.

Unknown Speaker  02:50
But anyway, but that's cool. That's cool. I

Unknown Speaker  03:03
Okay, okay, the s3 setup.

Matthias Miller  03:08
We're going to start with standard, well, we don't need permissions yet that can bump out into March to spring. The only thing really left,

Unknown Speaker  03:21
oh, this is okay, that's still December. I see,

Matthias Miller  03:24
yeah, detachment info, macro is really the thing that needs attention.

Speaker 1  03:29
Okay? And you said, add it wherever it's spec. I'm not. Do you mean contract, contract and contacts?

Matthias Miller  03:42
Yeah, we don't have any RGS on contacts currently. I don't believe so the, sorry,

Unknown Speaker  03:52
the track s3 stuff. Or

Matthias Miller  03:56
do we wherever we have s3 RGS? I think it's specs for contacts, but I don't know if we added

Unknown Speaker  04:05
it. I have no idea.

Unknown Speaker  04:07
Let me see. But let's just,

Matthias Miller  04:11
what I would do is, let's just catch up attachment info to where the records are, where the RGS are, and if we're missing our G's anywhere, then let's wait until we need them.

Speaker 1  04:28
So I mean, what I'm seeing in the s3 setup notes is that we need s3 for contract attachments and driver's license R, G on contacts. Is that right?

Matthias Miller  04:40
That sounds right. So it wouldn't hurt to add the if the RG, if we don't have an upload RG on the on the contact record, we should probably add one

Speaker 1  04:52
on the contact hadn't we decided we only wanted a single field?

Matthias Miller  04:58
But how did we do a single field? With, with attachment uploads.

Speaker 1  05:05
I don't know. I don't think I've ever really worked with attachment uploads.

Matthias Miller  05:09
So, I mean, we could have a hidden RG and then just show the most recent one with an ellipsis to view history.

Unknown Speaker  05:30
I'm just looking

Speaker 1  05:41
your your concern is that if you you upload one, then you upload another, you should be able to see the past ones. Probably you need some way. Well, I mean,

Matthias Miller  05:53
yeah, yeah, technically you

Speaker 1  05:55
don't want to just replace or can you, I don't see, I don't really know how s3 works.

Matthias Miller  06:00
S3 only expects for a in RG to exist. So you basically tell it, here's the RG, here's the underlying field that it stores its identifier in. Then you add macros for tell me what the file name is, and if you want to store creation date and time you have on inits in there, and then you have a view link that gets generated off of that, and a Delete link that gets generated from that, and you have a separate Upload link that comes from wherever.

Speaker 1  06:37
Okay, well, I think we do not have an RG on contact?

Unknown Speaker  06:43
Do we have one on contract?

Matthias Miller  06:45
Yes, we do on contract. I did see that one. Okay, okay,

Speaker 2  06:53
okay, so we should add one for contacts.

Unknown Speaker  07:00
And then do the attachment info.

Matthias Miller  07:05
Yeah, we are eventually going to want them on invoices and bills and possibly even payments deposits at some point. But if I care. I

Unknown Speaker  07:26
mean, I don't think I really care when we do it.

Speaker 1  07:34
I think our mantra has been to just build it when we need it. I would, I wonder if we should keep going with that so we can. I'm happy with that things out. Yep.

Speaker 1  07:54
Okay, so that gives me roughly what I need for s3 Should I have? Do you know, has Jonathan worked with Fs three stuff? Wonder if I should have him do it, although most of it's, it's not stuff. It really isn't. Nick, could,

Matthias Miller  08:14
I mean, if you respect that just a little bit, there's no reason why Sean couldn't do it. Yeah? Nick, can figure it out. Yeah, I would keep it on the component side.

Unknown Speaker  08:26
Yeah, okay, sounds good.

Unknown Speaker  08:35
Okay, and then what are NSS non

Matthias Miller  08:37
sufficient fund check returns. So backstory is, you can deposit a check and you can actually get partial credit, temporary credit, for the check, and then you get a reversal a couple days, a day or two later when it doesn't clear. So my proposal is that on the payment record, we can stomp in an NSF date, or NSF return date probably would be a better term, and it probably will need a more like an X 30 to record an NSF. And basically what it needs to do is do reversals on

Unknown Speaker  09:25
everything every

Matthias Miller  09:27
Well, when I say reversals, or is there an create NSF, correlating NSF entries and link it to the payment with the return date as the payment date. Do,

Unknown Speaker  09:47
a country date.

Unknown Speaker  09:50
That's the entry date. Yeah,

Speaker 1  09:52
so the events are G you record a new row or say this is. Rental fee, $100 rental fee year create that they paid ended well they didn't have the funds for then we add a row for the due date, for the period, plus the rent, plus a event type of rental fee or rental, and then an adjustment, a new adjustment type is NSF, which is not a credit, yep, and now, and that'll automatically reset balance stuff, Yep,

Matthias Miller  10:38
okay, and there's a bizarre hypothetical scenario where you could end up with a historical unpaid period and like, if you, if you, let's say, your check, they got the check in the mail, I don't know, late, late Tuesday evening, and then they record the payment and deposit it, and then You make a credit card payment that night, you could theoretically then have paid December with an open balance on November and whatever somebody's just gonna

Speaker 1  11:15
check if your check bounced, but your credit card Didn't, your credit card was fine. Yep. I mean, yeah, I'm not terribly worried about it. It's like. I don't think it's gonna it's weird. And I think if we need to, we can always manually go in and clean stuff up.

Speaker 2  11:36
Yeah? But I don't, I don't

Unknown Speaker  11:40
think it's going to cause that much trouble. Should the whiskey will just, I mean, we, we expect that you pay it in order,

Speaker 1  11:52
but we don't do the whiskey just gets all Not really. The whiskey gets whatever rows need to be paid yet, and our balance is all just calculated based on the balance for each period.

Unknown Speaker  12:11
Yep. So, yeah, I think it should be fine.

Matthias Miller  12:16
The tricky thing is that we'll need to prompt if there's multiple contracts on the payment, we'll need to somehow prompt which contract gets the NSF fee.

Speaker 1  12:37
So if you pay, you have two open and you, you try to pay both of them, makes sense, and then we only record one NSF fee

Matthias Miller  12:47
yep on the selected contract. Yep,

Unknown Speaker  12:50
right. Okay,

Matthias Miller  12:55
and we do nothing good

Speaker 1  12:57
when there's an when there's an NSF non sufficient funds. Does that mean it just straight bounce like there's we can't pull anything. Is there other times we get part, part of it?

Unknown Speaker  13:08
No, okay or nothing, okay?

Matthias Miller  13:17
And if you're a frequent really dicey. If you're a frequent violator, then you'll get your name written on a little sticky or little taped down sign at the cash register at Glen's block food to not accept checks from your from you. We had a few of those.

Unknown Speaker  13:41
That's crazy. We could automatically create notes. And then when someone goes to take a check at the at the quote, unquote register, then they could look view a list of people that have that frequently NSF,

Matthias Miller  13:59
put their put their name in there. I mean, you could, that's the nice thing about a check scanner. You could theoretically have it tied. In an ideal world, you just have it tied to a check scanner and check whether this account has bounced, you know, more than x number of times X time frame, and it does morning. Sorry, again, it's not processing. Can you pay cash, please, or card,

Speaker 1  14:23
you just automatically have all the red lights in the building go off,

Matthias Miller  14:27
yeah, and wailing signs. So conceptually, it's pretty simple. I mean, you could have the prompt for the NSF if you wanted to. You could have that be on the payment record or or you could have a sub pane that shows. Associated contracts and then have that sub pane drive the Ask prompt or something. I don't know. I don't know that it has to be a it shouldn't be a terrible workflow, but I don't know that has to be bells and whistles fancy

Unknown Speaker  15:22
with your with your spec. You said

Speaker 1  15:26
the main looks like the main report would prompt for customer and contract, and then a sub pane would also prompt for contract. Yeah, the idea, does it make sense? I don't. It gets a little dicey to prompt for contract. If there's potentially multiple contracts, doesn't it or not?

Matthias Miller  15:58
I thought was that somehow the sub pane would know. Are you

Speaker 1  16:04
just thinking that something would then know which con? Well, can we do that? Though? I don't.

Matthias Miller  16:13
I can try. Well, okay, let's take two, two giant steps back what we want to do. What would be ideal, would be on the customer or the contract, be able to say, have like a link to record an NSF, which pops up in this report, and you select the payment, and if you wanted to, you could even have payment subgroup to buy contract. You have it, have it be a contract level report grouped by payment of height. Well, we have not thought through invoice NF or invoices,

Unknown Speaker  16:52
which you probably should,

Matthias Miller  16:54
which we probably should, but let's bump it down the road.

Speaker 1  17:00
I mean, should I be creating, should we create a contract level report for now and just say, well, we'll cross that bridge when we get because we can knock it out as a contract report really easily right now. Yeah, future, I assume it's just going to be a model repeat list report, probably, or what,

Matthias Miller  17:22
yeah, or if it's on an invoice, you have to,

Unknown Speaker  17:26
I don't know, I guess.

Matthias Miller  17:38
I mean, I mean it's, you have to go find the invoice and do it from the invoice or something don't know, or a sub pane with invoice only payments, or alter right pain with invoice only?

Unknown Speaker  17:59
Yeah, oh, we'll cross that bridge when we get

Unknown Speaker  18:01
there. Yeah, we

Matthias Miller  18:02
don't even know where we're gonna record the fee, so I would, I would knock it out like this.

Speaker 1  18:06
First record the fee. What do you mean? I mean, if you want an invoice, where do you Yeah, oh, that's fair. Just add it to the invoice.

Matthias Miller  18:19
I mean, it seems reasonable to then,

Speaker 1  18:26
are they issuing paper invoices? Is it weird to Yeah, invoice when you've already sent a paper invoice, it

Matthias Miller  18:35
would probably make sense just create a subsequent invoice for the NSF fee. Probably require them to pay both.

Unknown Speaker  18:42
What if you pay an NSF fee with a check that bounces?

Matthias Miller  18:49
Well, I don't know how often that continues. I

Unknown Speaker  19:02
Which reminds me that it's fun to search for recursion. Have you done that? Have you seen what

Matthias Miller  19:11
Google does? Oh, in Google, yeah. It's been a minute. I've tried it before. I remember what

Speaker 1  19:16
it does if you search recursion, then it always says, Did you mean recursion,

Unknown Speaker  19:23
it's, yeah, it's fun,

Matthias Miller  19:30
yeah, I mean it seems people, I would say, just handle it here for now, And

Unknown Speaker  19:37
we'll cross it bridge when we get there. I

Unknown Speaker  19:45
Yeah, sounds good. And

Matthias Miller  19:48
then can you make a note for like, well, put a note at the top for NSF, for invoices, maybe they can talk about

Speaker 1  19:59
it note at the top. Is in that design, PM, plan, yeah, or add a new, okay, well, at the

Matthias Miller  20:11
Yeah, the very, very top of this, of the of the proposal, there's a group of items that like contract entry

Speaker 2  20:16
and yeah, contract tools and stuff, yeah. So just add a new, yep, Nero, perfect. Okay, I'm now tracking.

Unknown Speaker  20:36
Wow, this is slow.

Matthias Miller  20:38
It is. It's gotten 10 times worse in the last little bit, yeah,

Speaker 1  20:44
we're gonna need to do something. Is it just all the rows being added? Yeah?

Matthias Miller  20:49
I think so, and all the memos and all this other kinds of fun stuff, yeah?

Unknown Speaker  20:55
Yeah. Okay,

Speaker 1  21:02
so this is clearly top priority I see, or this in s3 Yeah, we think, we think it's the RTO PRO data stuff.

Matthias Miller  21:12
We think this is probably necessary to model RTO PRO data, which is why it's so high on the list. Makes sense?

Unknown Speaker  21:21
Okay? Probably

Speaker 1  21:25
record. We're doing guessing, I'm guessing our code, the NSF stuff. Does that sound right? Some of it's pretty simple, so I can maybe delegate parts of it. But once we're getting into the events. RG, I just get, I'm kind of protective,

Unknown Speaker  21:45
yeah, just because I have

Speaker 1  21:50
an instinctive sense of what's working and what, what will cause problems.

Matthias Miller  21:55
I think what probably what could make sense you could probably get is the point of you implementing it in the event surgery, and then specking out the report in The X 30 and the links, yeah, that's fair. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  22:24
A so

Speaker 1  22:25
renaming product to assets, that's going to take a bit of time.

Matthias Miller  22:30
I don't feel like I would not push that. That's not that piece itself should not be early January. That's a, that is a, I think, I think that's a go live thing and, and it's not like, in my opinion, it's not going to take substantially more time or early that's a back burner, like a rainy day.

Speaker 1  22:53
Yeah, it's perfect for Sean to do at some point. Yeah, when he needs work. Yeah.

Speaker 1  23:14
Set that as a three and throw it in his queue, and you can do it at some point. I Oh,

Speaker 1  23:28
we're probably gonna have to name it like only asset or something, because we don't we have assets

Matthias Miller  23:36
or a, well, it's not even necessarily a rental asset.

Unknown Speaker  23:40
Yeah, yeah, only asset is fine.

Matthias Miller  23:56
Okay, I think purchase financial should be fairly straightforward.

Unknown Speaker  24:05
It's done.

Unknown Speaker  24:07
Oh, it's done. Okay, great, even better, yeah,

Speaker 1  24:13
that was one of the first things we knocked off from January when we sort of ran out of

Speaker 2  24:17
December. I um,

Speaker 1  24:26
yeah, let me just plot that job ID, the Rename job ID in there.

Speaker 1  24:46
I'm trying now. I'm thinking about mostly sections is, if there's no red to do by it, then it's probably, I'm trying to mean that it's done.

Matthias Miller  24:55
Well, if it's done, though, we should move it down into the then we have a. Pleated spec section.

Speaker 1  25:01
Oh, you know, then what do I do with December? Because most of the December things are done, we've done there.

Unknown Speaker  25:10
Okay, so go in. Okay, okay, perfect. I'll get that done. Then it just make a note,

Speaker 1  25:24
so I'll make a task. I'm using C less tasks more and more.

Speaker 1  25:42
And should we go ahead and consolidate, like, spec for contract and stuff? Well, there's pieces where it's partially complete and partially not. I do start merging it,

Unknown Speaker  26:02
I don't feel

Matthias Miller  26:08
I would Okay, instinctively, I would have the most comprehensive spec be the part that's complete, and then just have segmented specs, or like, partial specs for things to be done, right? Because most of that, but like, as we or what,

Speaker 1  26:24
as we finish pieces of December and then January, should I move them down into completed and merge them into the spec, so we have a spec going forward that's not all fragmented? Or how do we think that should work?

Matthias Miller  26:41
I think so you can drop the section. I think for contracts, contracts are complicated enough. You don't want it

Unknown Speaker  26:47
in a single memo. No contracts, you don't.

Matthias Miller  26:52
I don't. Okay. The main thing that we need, I think that's a you question on your management side. The main thing that Dwayne, I need to know it is somewhat useful. Well, it's not been an issue at this point. Basically, at that point, it's in your court. You do what you want.

Speaker 2  27:12
Sounds good, perfect. I

Speaker 2  27:23
A collected

Matthias Miller  27:33
this requires some invoice changes, or it might be done. Yeah, no, so it should maybe go down after the invoice.

Unknown Speaker  27:52
What are invoice where invoice changes, like

Matthias Miller  27:54
early January, somewhere for

Unknown Speaker  28:06
Yeah, what's happening?

Unknown Speaker  28:27
At fully slow.

Matthias Miller  28:28
It's horrible.

Unknown Speaker  28:49
This depends on just two

Speaker 2  28:59
initiation Oh, you want, we

Unknown Speaker  29:04
need depreciation calcs live so that you can vocals in it.

Unknown Speaker  29:10
Basically, yeah,

Speaker 1  29:15
I don't, yeah. I need to look at it with him. I think trying to work through a very vague speck was getting

Speaker 2  29:23
to be a bit much. He

Speaker 1  29:29
despises trying to work through vague spec if he can. If he doesn't quite have an eight, doesn't really know where we're going, then it's just terribly

Unknown Speaker  29:37
hard to push ahead. Yep. So

Speaker 1  29:42
I think, you know, I'll probably sit down see if we can make some headway, and if not, then we might loop you in or something.

Matthias Miller  29:48
Okay, it's very straightforward in my head of what needs to be done, whether my head is right or wrong, but if you need anything going down, yeah, okay. Do.

Unknown Speaker  30:01
Um, Bill record, attachments are on as one thing. I think attachments are the only thing that are left here.

Matthias Miller  30:14
Yeah, there's this weird section down the bottom that's just kind of like, I think it's just babbled.

Unknown Speaker  30:22
But do we need to think about it?

Unknown Speaker  30:31
What is it? We do need to think

Matthias Miller  30:34
through conversion to CRA to deposit.

Speaker 1  30:39
Well, there's a you have a big section for that somewhere,

Matthias Miller  30:44
don't you? Well, I moved this from another section into here because it was fairly closely related. I think the we will also need a way to record payments in that

Unknown Speaker  30:54
mid January. CRA conversion, okay.

Matthias Miller  31:01
Well, in this stuff, could any notes? Here? Could be any CRA related notes? Good move there.

Unknown Speaker  31:24
Why is there discussion about refunds?

Matthias Miller  31:30
Do we handle refunds

Unknown Speaker  31:32
or bills?

Unknown Speaker  31:39
That'd be someone refunds, invoices.

Unknown Speaker  31:49
Okay?

Unknown Speaker  32:11
I'm moving all the series stuff out and

Speaker 1  32:39
so Dwayne's replying to some question, I don't know what, but saying he thinks you're referring to someone having more than one contract, and the refund is a move from paying one contract to another.

Unknown Speaker  33:00
I don't know why this is in This section.

Matthias Miller  33:14
No, it shouldn't be. I I usually think should happen, everything down through the from the we will also need down to the natural line needs to go into

Unknown Speaker  33:36
history,

Matthias Miller  33:42
the the of contract closure,

Speaker 1  33:47
I moved the only thing I have left. I moved most other things to CRA Okay, the only thing I have left is Dwayne's comment on 11, five, one, that's up to history that you talked about.

Matthias Miller  34:00
Just move the move that into move it somewhere up in that top section to think about, okay.

Speaker 2  35:00
Then, for bills, you also have a

Unknown Speaker  35:06
view for accounting impact stuff.

Unknown Speaker  35:13
You should handle that. Where should I note it?

Speaker 1  35:20
Who owns, are you owning accounting impact for now

Matthias Miller  35:23
at this at this point, for now? Yeah, okay.

Speaker 1  35:30
How do you want to make changes like that? Do you should I assign product changes to you,

Matthias Miller  35:38
or I'm I'm gonna miss product changes. Bottom line, I'm not in CLS enough, yeah, move it to, I mean, just probably the easiest, the, I mean, the easiest way for me is like keeping it on the radar, and then whenever we get past migration and design to go do it, or it's a we really need this. Okay, just in time. Okay, so you just leave a section to say that we'll be doing it. We'll just leave it wherever it needs to be. That's good.

Speaker 1  36:27
Auto pay. We need a way to run auto pay. So payments need a check box.

Unknown Speaker  36:44
The date and time

Unknown Speaker  36:46
that it was run,

Matthias Miller  36:49
is that not story that would be on the payment? Anyway, we just need to know the payment somehow tied out to the fact that it's an auto pay payment, which I was assuming we'd have something like that.

Unknown Speaker  37:00
Anyway, okay, yeah, I'm pretty sure

Unknown Speaker  37:14
if we don't cash a payment date and time now we

Unknown Speaker  37:19
we can add that

Matthias Miller  37:23
but I guess the other question is, how do we really, realistically want to trigger this? Do we want to maybe this is a Josh question. I

Matthias Miller  37:46
and also, why is it running at 11pm instead of like 1am or something like that?

Unknown Speaker  37:59
I don't know. I let me,

Matthias Miller  38:05
let me

Unknown Speaker  38:06
run it earlier today. It

Matthias Miller  38:08
seems to me like the nicest way would be able to be able to have some kind of way, in the whizzy world, to set up a cron or something that runs at a specific time or, I mean, the only other way to do it really is a scheduled task that triggers an external I mean, configure it. Yeah, I have a trigger that triggers the whiskey. But, like, why not just, I don't know. Let me check with Josh, see if he has thoughts for

Unknown Speaker  38:58
you to talk with him.

Speaker 1  39:05
I think auto pay is roughly in place. We need to link to link by row ID to the event search. G, yeah, I think is about and then adding it, adding it to actually run. And I wouldn't be shocked if we run into some more quirks with scheduling. We've done a fair bit of work trying to make it right, but it's just kind of complicated, yep. Okay, so you'll talk with Josh on the best way to have it automatically run

Unknown Speaker  39:44
track record.

Unknown Speaker  39:47
Need to refactor from assist.

Unknown Speaker  40:03
Like I had, I'm pretty sure product change for this.

Speaker 2  40:13
We talked about it, yeah, we talked about it while I was at Fairview Service Center.

Matthias Miller  40:21
Thank you. I'm slightly worried. I mean, we might may need to add a config system switch on how to handle the total setting.

Matthias Miller  40:41
There's basically we're sitting,

Speaker 1  40:43
we're sitting on the exciting company. Wait, is that on check, or are you looking at deposit? Oh, I'm sorry.

Unknown Speaker  40:49
Never mind check. Okay, okay, yeah. Well,

Unknown Speaker  40:52
checks, I just need to look at again to see,

Unknown Speaker  40:55
let me see how much I had specked in that job. I

Speaker 1  41:04
What's scary is the migration for zfp, making sure that works, right?

Matthias Miller  41:10
I mean, but renaming the what's the migration? Renaming the record type?

Speaker 1  41:16
No, that's fine. It was the layout stuff. So that is printing, which you said could be delayed, right? It could be delayed, yes,

Unknown Speaker  41:26
okay, why don't we

Speaker 1  41:30
break that? Because that's where you'd wanted to add, like, a new lookup level and stuff for layouts that's just going to take work to get right.

Matthias Miller  41:42
That's right because you conceptually need a separate layout for RTO company, don't you? Yeah? For accounting, yeah, yeah, let's defer that.

Speaker 1  41:52
Awesome. I like it. Okay, so where will that? Where should I put that for now, spring, Oh, perfect. By the

Matthias Miller  42:12
way, I'm gonna have to hot drop in 15 minutes, sure. I mean,

Unknown Speaker  42:16
this gives me a bunch of stuff I can spec and get us working on.

Unknown Speaker  42:19
So that's good. Awesome.

Unknown Speaker  42:23
Now I just need Nick to have time to work On stuff exactly.

Speaker 2  42:38
Support, chat, support, different layouts.

Unknown Speaker  43:00
Layouts,

Speaker 2  43:18
okay, so that's checks I have that put in spring for the layout stuff, deposit. You were saying that.

Speaker 1  43:35
Are you thinking the total should be a field or only? But how are you going to handle it for

Matthias Miller  43:43
well, okay, here's the way it is. Now CFP does not have a field. It's auto calculated, and that means that deleting, deleting, if you could delete a payment with a deposit or you had a deposit record, then total changes. Now we could, there's a few options. One, we could go to zfp and say, hey, well, we really think you should put a total in and match it up and match it up. And if they say, Oh yeah, yeah, that makes sense, then, well, we're fine, great. If they say no, then theoretically, we're in a world where we need to say, all right, some cases you calculated off an entry field, some cases often off a calculated total and basically you would have a you have a deposit total macro, you have an entered total amount, and you have a calculated total amount, and then your macro, yeah, either the accounting switch per system switch or something, and says, figures out which one.

Speaker 1  44:50
Yeah, makes sense. Okay. I mean, this also isn't mean. It's just. A little bit of dancing to check with to make it pull it out of CFP, but it shouldn't be bad

Unknown Speaker  45:06
at all. Yeah, I don't think so.

Unknown Speaker  45:15
Should we ask them now?

Speaker 1  45:18
Or when do you want to talk to them about the total stuff? I have a

Matthias Miller  45:25
feeling it's going to be really hard to explain through an email that you will understand. And so that sounds, I feel, I feel like we should move it as it is now, and have a mid January, moving towards the end of January, early January, whatever that is to actually apply that

Unknown Speaker  45:49
impact work.

Unknown Speaker  45:51
Put it on the agenda

Unknown Speaker  45:54
to move this, the whole deposit record, to No, no. Move the, oh, just the total stuff.

Matthias Miller  46:00
Just To further the total stuff, okay, okay, I'm

Speaker 2  46:25
then your virtual energy of all undeposited payments. Checkbox to add or remove from an underlying RG,

Matthias Miller  47:00
okay. That same Jiminy. I mean, I think we could use indices to make it not be terrible. Any thoughts on that?

Speaker 1  47:17
So, basically, it's a virtual RG concaten any payments in the RG and any undeposited payments, yep. I mean, that seems sane, with validation in place, in case they have the record open and change something somewhere else and come back and save here, right?

Matthias Miller  47:41
Something like that, yep, yeah, you can't double

Unknown Speaker  47:44
deposit. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  47:54
Okay, hey, we have the green light to proceed with project management. Hey, let's go nice.

Unknown Speaker  48:17
Hey, what next?

Unknown Speaker  48:25
Yes cash and check refunds. So

Matthias Miller  48:51
we think it can be relatively manual. I think the payment portal probably practically has to handle it for credit card refunds. And I think when you refund, if it's a partial refund, you have to say, I don't know what it is. I think in some ways, what would be nice would be going to edit the payment, you adjust the differences down, and we'll accept. Which payment do you edit? And keep in mind you may have multiple Oh, yikes.

Matthias Miller  49:36
This feels like something that you and I should

Unknown Speaker  49:40
may need some work. Let's

Matthias Miller  49:43
defer that, and let's set up a time. No, let's, I mean, let's, I'm very skeptical. Well, let's get back to me early January, and let's design it. Okay, do.

Unknown Speaker  50:09
Sounds good. Payment portal

Matthias Miller  50:19
refunding could go up in the other one that we

Matthias Miller  50:26
did in the portal forgiveness is entered in the

Unknown Speaker  50:31
yeah on the contract, yeah, that was just an old Oh. And then

Matthias Miller  50:40
Jonathan was wondering, how do we validate that all of the payment rows in a contract for certain payment match the payments total? And I'm going to assume that, well,

Matthias Miller  50:54
do something dumb. And then, second of all, I would assume that Dwayne doesn't like this, but at some point you just have to have some kind of exception report that says, Look, somebody really screwed something up in accounting. You need to go fix it.

Unknown Speaker  51:10
Yeah, yeah. So is this a January piece?

Matthias Miller  51:21
What kind of piece is it?

Matthias Miller  51:28
I don't actually think that it. I mean, maybe I would personally put it like late January.

Unknown Speaker  51:34
I don't know that we actually need to do that much with it. Okay, and PDF receipt is that's

Speaker 1  51:43
something Jonathan's already been working on. Okay, good. I think the route he's going, you can view it in the whiskey or we can add a report link on the payment record. Either one should work. Probably be nice to have one, a link up from the payment that's Andre, or you mean

Matthias Miller  52:11
the payment detail screen for payment board, yeah, detail screen, sure. I mean, I was

Speaker 1  52:15
thinking detail screen. It's easy enough to do. I think just do it. I

Unknown Speaker  52:30
A sales tax needs work yet.

Unknown Speaker  53:09
Eight. Let's see,

Unknown Speaker  53:18
when are we integrating the texture spring?

Speaker 1  53:22
Probably okay. So for now, we're fine with our current our current model is just fine, yeah, yeah, manual entry, and then it gets cached in events. RG, I mean, that's not going to change. It's just that we have manual entry, right? We need to build the logic to cache it in the liabilities. RG, just if think is we talked about using a field change, maybe. But just saying, what's the net of the events, og for current period or for periods and jurisdictions, right?

Unknown Speaker  54:10
Think that's right, yeah, so that's just like, that just has to happen yet we haven't.

Speaker 1  54:20
Yeah, I feel like that. Does it sound right that I should code that? Or should I try to spec it out for Nick

Matthias Miller  54:32
it feels like, I mean, you might, I think that depends on your workload. It's going to be probably faster. I mean, end of the day, it's probably going to be faster and less stress for you just to go code it. But, yeah, if you but if you're slammed for time, then honestly, spending 30 minutes to go spec out how it should work and getting it off to him, yeah, will free you up.

Speaker 2  54:57
So, yeah, it's true. Do.

Speaker 1  55:00
Yeah, and then reporting for filing, filing taxes, that's gonna, I think we want to look at that then, or is that? Is that very going to be very similar to what we have in EFP?

Unknown Speaker  55:14
I'm happy

Matthias Miller  55:16
with what we have in CFP hack.

Unknown Speaker  55:23
So just build essentially the same framework.

Unknown Speaker  55:27
We're forget how exactly we're doing it.

Unknown Speaker  55:39
You let's see.

Matthias Miller  55:47
Why wouldn't you manage incurred versus paid in the contracts? RG,

Matthias Miller  56:00
do you mean? Well, actually, we're going to include payments on the bill. So to figure out what you need to pay, we're going to look at what's incurred across all contracts, minus what's been paid across all bills, and come up with the balance and push that onto a new bill. Right?

Unknown Speaker  56:26
Yes, yeah, I think so. And then each each row in the RG on the Okay,

Unknown Speaker  56:42
how did we have that?

Speaker 1  56:45
Didn't we have some RG on the bill?

Matthias Miller  56:50
Yeah, NRG. I mean, was an NRG tank back to, I don't know if I like this, though.

Speaker 1  56:57
Um, right now we literally are trying, trying to, looks like we're trying to tie back to the events. RG, that doesn't seem right.

Matthias Miller  57:10
I think the Okay, here's, here's what I think. I think the field change should look at everything that's incurred, or should be incurred by jurisdiction on the events. RG, and create Delta incurment rows in the liabilities. RG, and I think when you go to pay,

Unknown Speaker  57:29
you should,

Matthias Miller  57:32
you should just go, you should add,

Speaker 1  57:36
does it add rows for the liability? No, because you might want to do a net

Matthias Miller  57:44
it would look at total increment minus prior payments to come up with a payment to net everything out to zero,

Matthias Miller  57:58
and then, and then your Bill would just be a single bill to the vendor for that amount,

Unknown Speaker  58:06
and the bill wouldn't have itemization.

Matthias Miller  58:09
No, you would get the itemization elsewhere,

Unknown Speaker  58:12
off the liabilities, right?

Matthias Miller  58:15
You would sum up all the liabilities to get the bill for that period, end date or something. So then

Unknown Speaker  58:27
this RG that we have on bills just disappears. Yeah, no, we do need to link the contract, don't we? Or

Unknown Speaker  58:50
not, that's where we store

Unknown Speaker  58:57
what was incurred. We have to know what was paid for

Unknown Speaker  59:03
that contractor? No. So don't you have an RG of

Speaker 1  59:21
Well, wasn't our thought process here that it was nicer to be able to tie back

Unknown Speaker  59:28
the back the other way. Maybe it was.

Matthias Miller  59:33
It still might be. Yeah, it probably is.

Speaker 1  59:40
I mean, then, aren't you essentially,

Unknown Speaker  59:46
how is it?

Matthias Miller  59:53
So then, then, essentially, you need to take a look at all bills for all jurisdictions. You.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:09
I mean, doesn't there need to be atomization on the bill?

Speaker 1  1:00:19
Or do we go stomp in the is it sort of like a deposit in a sales order, where you stomp in the ID on RG rows on the contract, and then that gives you a total that should match the field. So

Matthias Miller  1:00:42
Well, I mean, keep in mind, you would create a row on the in my mind, it makes more sense to throw all that liability stuff into single RG and then just have

Unknown Speaker  1:01:00
on the on the contract,

Matthias Miller  1:01:03
on the contract, and then just tie out. And then actually your bills paying the right amount, yeah.

Speaker 1  1:01:09
And then you just have a field on in the contract, liabilities, RG, for the link bill to pay that row right, right. And then you got good. And then And then yeah, and you just some so it's a very similar structure to deposit and sales order.

Matthias Miller  1:01:29
Yeah, I think so I gotta drop we're gonna have to pick this up.

Speaker 2  1:01:33
Sorry, okay, but I think I like that better. Okay, sounds good. Okay, thank you. Yep, see ya. You.
