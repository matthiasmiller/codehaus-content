Speaker 1  00:00
Matches doing his thing. So, yes, exactly. We get all fired up on some matcha tea. Good, awesome. You guys are doing such great work. You're doing such great work. You're you're like, outperforming what a lot of business people with MBAs would be able to do. So keep up the great work. All right, so sharing my screen here in three, two and one, loading, loading, once you can see it, maybe give it a thumbs up. Once you can see it, yes, yes, yes, okay, great. Okay, so we're in year five. Now it's 2017 and Jason, please let me know what happened. Just read it. Just read it right there. What happened? All right,

Speaker 2  00:47
we made 400,000 in revenue. We had 250,000 expenses, 30,000 dividend and eight I mean, $0 on a loan, pay down and year two, depreciation of 10k

Speaker 1  01:02
Awesome. Very good, very good. So let's, let's start

Unknown Speaker  01:10
over the balance sheet.

Speaker 1  01:12
Okay, let's see if it'll let me do it. I got a rogue $130,000 somewhere. Okay, there it is. All right, so what do we have for help me copy it over.

Unknown Speaker  01:24
All right. Assets, 160,000 Okay, 160 Yep. 120,000 120,000 Okay, 1000, okay.

Speaker 1  01:42
You said 40 right, yep, okay, I building 30,000 loan, 30,000 Okay, and then what do you have for equity? 130,000 130,000 Okay, great, awesome. So far, so good. Moving forward, what? What's next, right?

Unknown Speaker  02:09
So we're gonna take what happened, and we're gonna put in 400,000 revenue.

Unknown Speaker  02:16
Okay, great, 400,000

Unknown Speaker  02:19
for expenses, 250,000

Unknown Speaker  02:22
Okay, great. We got $250,000 I've got it in there. Yep,

Speaker 2  02:28
all right, so now I'm scared, but earnings would be 150,000 but we're gonna throw in that depreciation. So is that could be 160

Speaker 1  02:43
Yes, Well done, because we have to add back the non cash expense when we go over to OCF. Okay, you're doing great, man. Keep going.

Speaker 2  03:04
All right, I'm cheating. I'm looking at my first sheet where I drew tons of arrows. All right, so beginning cash is going to be the cash from the balance sheet. So that's 120,000

Unknown Speaker  03:21
indeed. Yep, great work.

Unknown Speaker  03:29
All right, so the earnings is going to be 150,000 and then adjust for depreciation, is 10,000

Speaker 1  03:36
Yes, 60,000 which is what I should have done on the previous build to Quinn's point, this definitely would have made life easier.

Speaker 2  03:49
Oops, all right, we earned the knowledge through pain.

Unknown Speaker  03:56
You earned it, and you'll remember it now, right?

Unknown Speaker  04:00
Okay, what's next?

Speaker 2  04:07
Okay, hold on, I'm realizing I'm not writing down the numbers. All right, there we go. So FCF, loan zero distribution.

Unknown Speaker  04:21
This

Speaker 2  04:25
I don't remember where SCF comes from. Oh, loan and distribution. Loan is zero, right? Oh, it's already said zero and distribution is zero. Uh, zero.

Unknown Speaker  04:45
So the distribution is

Speaker 2  04:46
same as a dividend. That's the dividend, right, right, right. Okay, so as an owner, we took out 30k

Unknown Speaker  04:55
and is it positive or negative?

Unknown Speaker  04:59
Um. That would be

Speaker 2  05:02
negative because out of the business, yes, cash we no longer have,

Unknown Speaker  05:11
that the business no longer

Speaker 2  05:13
has. Yeah, it's now in a bank account. Yes, it is okay. What else? All right, so that means the FCF is negative 30,000

Unknown Speaker  05:26
Okay,

Unknown Speaker  05:31
all right, keep rolling.

Speaker 2  05:35
Okay, in cash, so that'd be beginning cash plus OCF, which would be 280 Okay, minus 30 so 250

Speaker 1  05:51
okay. And remember this the ICF, so 280 plus zero is 280 and then, what did

Unknown Speaker  05:55
you say? And then minus 30, so 250

Unknown Speaker  05:59
okay, perfect

Unknown Speaker  06:01
for end cash.

Speaker 1  06:06
Okay, 250 Okay, great, keep going. Okay,

Speaker 2  06:13
so n cash can come down to cash on the balance sheet.

Unknown Speaker  06:18
Yep, 50, oops. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  06:26
okay, software,

Unknown Speaker  06:34
that's going to be, I don't remember,

Speaker 2  06:42
is, that going to be negative, because we haven't paid all of it down.

Speaker 1  06:48
So this is our ending balance sheet. And what was soft? What was the value of software on the beginning balance

Speaker 2  06:54
sheet? It was 40. So now it is, it's depreciating. So it's 30,000

Speaker 1  07:02
bingo, yes, you got it, okay, yes, and it's worth 30. It's not worth negative 30. It's still worth 30, just like the pickup truck was still worth $17,000 or whatever. So it's plus 30, yep. Okay, keep going.

Speaker 2  07:18
Okay, so then the total assets would be those two combined, which be 280

Unknown Speaker  07:30
Okay, keep going.

Speaker 2  07:32
Okay, loan, loan, there was zero pay down, so it's still 30,000

Unknown Speaker  07:45
I'm digging it, yep.

Unknown Speaker  07:50
Which means liability is still 30,000

Speaker 1  07:53
You bet you. Man, and let's this time for the equity section, let's, let's start in this area. Okay,

Speaker 2  08:03
so previous equity would be from the previous balance sheet, right? 130 1000. Bingo. You got it, man? 130 Yep. Okay, and earnings would we do? 150 1000? Yes, exactly. And then we would do distribution. We would do negative 30,000

Unknown Speaker  08:35
and what's your rationale behind it? Being negative?

Speaker 2  08:41
Because it's being taken out of the business.

Speaker 1  08:48
So I'd say taken out of the business would be the right words for cash being taken out of the business. I would say that the net worth of the business, the equity of the business, got was started at 130 before the year went up by 150 because of the the operating of the company. And then the equity went down by negative $30,000 the the net worth of the company went down by negative 30 because we took over here, negative 30 in cash out of the business, right? Yeah, great. So let's sum all this up. All right, so 130 plus 150

Speaker 2  09:29
would be 280 minus 30 would be 250 so equity would be 250,000

Speaker 1  09:39
Okay, now let's do our double check of assets minus liabilities which you got,

Speaker 2  09:43
and we can check that against the end cash and statement of cash flows, right?

Unknown Speaker  09:49
And,

Speaker 1  09:51
oh, this, yeah, this N Cash is this number here. It's just coincidence that this is also the same number. That's just coincidence. Yeah? This. Right? Here is not coincidence. This N Cash. Is this cash, but this equity is it's just coincidence that it's the same number as those guys. Okay, got

Speaker 2  10:09
it all right? Then, yeah, so we could take the assets minus the liability, and that equals equity.

Speaker 1  10:21
Bingo. 280 minus 30 is 250 you did it

Unknown Speaker  10:27
all right. Now I'm gonna take none.

Speaker 1  10:30
Yeah. Round of applause for Jason. Way to go. And I don't think we gave Deborah a round of applause either. So Deborah, round of applause for Deborah. Reynolds, yes. Well done. Well done. Well done, impressive, awesome, good. And coming up, we only have three more builds, so I'm tempted to keep going, but let me just take a peek. I think it's the one with inventory that has a bit of a brain bend on it as well. Let me just see here. Did I buy? What happened here? Revenue, expense, depreciation, inventory, yes, this is the t shirt build. Okay, that'll be what? Oh, go ahead, Tim, what was that? Brandon, I

Speaker 3  11:10
was just gonna say I filled it out while you guys were doing that to see if I could pre populate it and get it right. But

Speaker 1  11:17
go ahead. Okay, yeah, I think we're gonna start with this tomorrow. And Brandon, if you wanna lead the charge on want to lead the charge on that one tomorrow morning, first thing, that'd be great. I think, I think, because we spent a whole day looking at this, let's just shift gears a little bit here. I want to now show you guys what real financials look like compared to diamond financial so I'm sure you've all seen real financials before, and so now let's just compare the two. So this is, for example, just gonna pull this from my other screen. So this is the typical financials that you would get from an accountant. Okay, so first of all, can someone tell me of the three document types this page of the financials. Which one is it?

Unknown Speaker  12:04
Income Statement,

Speaker 1  12:06
Balance if we look so, if we look, yeah, balance sheet. Now what else? What else tells you that it's a balance sheet? What other hints

Speaker 4  12:16
Do you have? Assets and liabilities?

Unknown Speaker  12:19
Yep, assets and liabilities, yeah, which kind of

Speaker 5  12:22
talks about it? Word assess, the word as of,

Speaker 1  12:25
yes, yes. It's exact. It's this is the State of the Union on this day, since inception, until today, which could be hundreds of years or one year or six months. Doesn't matter, but it's since inception. Good. Okay, so what pieces you know, if we think about our let's see if I can pull this into view here, if we think about our diamond financials, which is kind of four, four boxes from this, from what we see so far, how many of the four boxes can we fill just from what you see on the screen, on this one page of these financials, just one? Quinn says one. Lauren says two. Lauren. Why do you say two?

Unknown Speaker  13:22
Well, yeah, now I feel like it's just one.

Speaker 1  13:25
Okay, okay, so Quinn, why do you say just one?

Speaker 6  13:31
Because all I can see is the assets and liabilities. I don't see the income and earnings or expenses yet.

Speaker 1  13:39
Okay, yeah, that's true. There's no income or expenses on here. Good point. Okay, who else, Lauren, do you have a rationale for one or two at this point?

Speaker 4  13:51
No, I mean, I was thinking that you could do maybe the income statement, part of it, but now I'm second guessing myself.

Unknown Speaker  13:59
I think you can do two.

Unknown Speaker  14:02
Okay, what do you think Brandon? And why is

Speaker 3  14:04
that? And there are two on the diamond financials. You're saying Correct?

Speaker 1  14:09
I'm asking on the diamond financials, we've got four boxes from this document here. You

Unknown Speaker  14:14
can do two on those is because you can do 2001 and 2002

Unknown Speaker  14:18
of what?

Unknown Speaker  14:20
Of the balance sheet. So you could do two at the

Speaker 7  14:22
bingo, bingo. That's right. I gotta trust myself. That's

Speaker 1  14:27
right. Yes, trust yourself, your inner knowing. So this these numbers right here is the beginning balance sheet, which is this up here, and then this right here, is our ending balance sheet. And you can see it says as at June 30, 2002 so I'm going to assume this is June 30, 2002 this is the ending balance sheet, which is the square at the bottom right here. Everybody's following that? Yes, yes, yeah. Okay, good. Brandon's pumped. Lauren says, way to go. Brandon, indeed. Okay, great. Right? So from there, look, look what we've got. We've got cash, right? Whoops, that's sure highlighting a lot. We've got cash right. So that would be just like our cash line right here, right? We haven't gotten into things like accounts receivable, inventory and whatnot. We're going to get into inventory in our next build. So that's coming. When you look at liabilities, we see things here, current, if you remember, all the way, going back to like this morning, I said current liabilities is anything that's a year or less, right? That's current or short term liabilities, long term liabilities anything more than a year. So if I have long term debt, that's that's debt that I have to pay off more than a year from now. So if I were to have five year, if I were to have debt that I have to pay out over five years, and I'm then whatever I have to pay this just this year, would show up in current, right? So this, it's right here, long term debt. Current portion of long term debt is 25,000 that shows up in current and then the rest of it would still be here in long term debt. Now you can see in this set of financials, and this isn't it's amazing the number of ways that you see financials done. This says note four. So that means, all that means is scroll further down in these financials and find note four, and see what it has to say the accountants giving us some added information. So if we were to scroll down, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, we get into the notes section low. So right here it says note number four, long term debt. So they're just telling us that it's a bank term loan bearing interest at prime plus two monthly principal installment. So it's just giving us right some information, it was 111,300 that we took it on, minus the current portion of 25 the repayment is 86 and it looks like we've had this loan since 2004 so it's just, it's just interesting, you know, if you wanted, if you needed to dig into the history of it, then we could do that. Okay, great. So that's our balance sheet. Now, if we come down, what's this next document? Any ideas? What is this document? Now,

Unknown Speaker  17:10
income statement,

Unknown Speaker  17:12
yes, indeed. Peter, and how do you know

Unknown Speaker  17:14
that? Because it says at the top,

Speaker 1  17:16
it says exactly, statement of income, or income statement, yes, revenue, and what revenue, yep, and expenses, Yep, good, good. And what Peter, what period does this cover?

Unknown Speaker  17:34
From 2001 to 2002

Speaker 1  17:39
and specifically, what day till June 30. So from what specific day to what specific day

Speaker 8  17:46
from January 1, 2002 to June 30, 2002

Speaker 1  17:56
so they're there. Yeah, yeah. Okay. So, so this one, there's a reason I threw this curveball in here. I'm sorry to be so cruel to Peter to throw this curveball at you. It's like Pete's like, I should have known, yeah. So, Lauren, do you know it sounds like, you know what days this is

Speaker 4  18:17
the fiscal year? Mm, hmm.

Speaker 1  18:20
Sometimes a fit. Go ahead. No, you go. We got a Canadian traffic jam here. Everyone's saying, No, you go, No, you go, no

Speaker 9  18:28
one. I'll go. July 1, 2001 to June 30, 2002

Speaker 1  18:34
Closer, closer. Bum. Bum bum. Ooh.

Speaker 4  18:41
Is it June 29 to June 30? Or June 29 22,001 to June 30, 2000

Speaker 1  18:48
so, So Deborah is right that it's July 1, but it's July 1, 2000 because, because this right here, if this is the year ended June 30, then this is the year ended June 30, 2001 and it's covering the same time period. So that would be one year. So it would be July 1 2000 until June 30, 2001 and then July 1, 2001 until June 30, 2002 would be here. Everybody see that that was super cruel. You guys, I'm so sorry that was a double curve ball. Yeah? Oh my god. If I ever want anyone to participate in these things, I'm gonna have to be a little nicer about it. Yeah? Okay, so, so we'll talk about inventory tomorrow. I also, guys, I want you to make this note, gross profit and net profit are two radically different numbers, and we're going to talk some more about that tomorrow. Let me get through the rest of this document, and if we've got time, I'll give you a sneak preview on that. Otherwise, let's just keep. Moving, okay, net income. And then we got net income before tax, net income. So what would you say the bottom line, profit for this business is, let me just zoom out just a touch.

Speaker 1  20:23
That was a lot, if you guys can still read that, what is the what's the bottom line profit of this business? $17,166

Speaker 1  20:39
so that is the bottom line of the piece of paper. It's actually not our bottom line. Profit,

Unknown Speaker  20:46
78 516

Speaker 1  20:49
net income. That is absolutely right. Yeah, net income, 78,005 16. Now, what they're what, what they've done, and I'm so sorry to throw yet another curveball. You guys, they've actually combined their income statement, and they're like retained earnings calculation on the same piece of paper. So net income is 78, 516, and what they're saying, if you remember over here, you remember how we talked about previous, previous year equity, then we adjust for earnings and distribution whatnot. To come up with new equity, we need to figure out, you know, are we carrying forward a loss from the past, or are we carrying forward a profit from the past? And so on this piece of paper, they're actually telling us in the and by the way, if it's got brackets, deficit means it's a negative number. So like, this is negative 387, this is positive 16, 149, this is negative 1101

Unknown Speaker  21:54
so at the end of 2001 their net income was 8810, and their retained earnings, which is retained, which is previous equity, is, is not exactly the same. Forget, I said that. That's that's confusing. It's the previous period earnings is right here. Did I

Speaker 1  22:23
Yes. So they are at negative 61, 350, was retained earnings from the previous year. So guess what? They started the next year with negative retained earnings. They had a certain amount of net income. 78,005, 16 was the bottom line profit for the year. This is where they were at the start of the year. They didn't pay any dividends to the owners, right? And so then that means the retained earnings at the end of year, 17, 166, so we can see that, in 2002 did they pay any dividends to the owner? No. In 2001 did they pay dividends to the owner? Did the owner put money into the business? Which way did it go?

Speaker 10  23:12
The owner took the dividend? How do you know that? Because it's negative, right? Very good.

Speaker 1  23:19
So, yeah, the net equity company went down because $16,000 went out. Dollars went out. So not a great year when they had net income of only $8,000 right? They were at a deficit of 54,000 the year before they all they they had net income of 8800 but they paid out $16,000 in dividends. So each wrong direction, guys, wrong direction. Okay, and where's the party

Speaker 4  23:49
in the hole from the previous year? Isn't that what that says right above the 16,000 that they started the year at negative $54,000

Speaker 1  23:57
well, so this is a spot where some precision in language would probably make the difference. And in the hole is tough to say, because in the hole, does that mean that the company's balance sheet is in debt, like they're upside down on the balance sheet and they're being floated by loans. Does? Does upside down mean just for the one year they had negative earnings. Like, we kind of don't know what that means. So, So where could we work? So maybe John asked that question again, and I can answer it with a more precise answer,

Speaker 4  24:29
oh, I was just gonna say, it looks to me that they had a negative starting balance for the year, for 2001

Unknown Speaker  24:41
and where do you Where did you get that information?

Unknown Speaker  24:44
Right where your mouse is hovering,

Unknown Speaker  24:47
where my mouse is right here? Oh, I guess

Unknown Speaker  24:50
it's my mouse, huh? 54, 160,

Speaker 1  24:53
okay, so that was their deficit in that was their deficit in earnings from the per. Previous year. So, so that doesn't necessarily mean a negative balance, though. To get a balance, we would have to look at the balance sheet, and we can see that they actually had $209,000 in current assets. Gotcha. And so, so they started the at June 30 of 2001 they were they had two to $9,000 in assets. So, you know, it's kind of,

Speaker 4  25:30
Oh, I see it was just the shareholders equity that was negative.

Speaker 1  25:35
It was, well, it was the retained earnings of the company and that, and that, that includes how much we've paid out to the owners. So,

Unknown Speaker  25:45
yeah, so Cloud everything.

Speaker 1  25:48
Oh no, no. You're helping clarify everything for everyone. Thank you. So, so, you know it's, it's kind of like, well, 2000 2002 at least on paper, doesn't really look like we've made a lot of progress. And if we look at the amount of cash that we had zero cash here, we've got 11,000 552, so that's gone up by about 10 grand, although we also did. We got rid of some property, plant and equipment, like we got rid of 16 grand. Or something happened that our assets actually went down. We sold, or got rid or depreciate like something happened and so like this isn't a real strong improvement from one year to the next, and we could, you know, and tomorrow, you'll gain more and more skills around this. Let's look at one more document. What document is this?

Unknown Speaker  26:38
Statement of Cash Flow?

Unknown Speaker  26:40
Yes, for what period?

Unknown Speaker  26:45
The same one as before,

Speaker 1  26:46
yes. So, because this is the year ended, June 30, we got 02 and 01 which means June 30, oh two and June 30, oh one, and it matches the income statement here, we can create our diamond, right? Because now we've got this guy here income statement. We've got this guy here statement. Of cash flows. We also had our beginning and ending balance sheet. We are off to the races. Now you can see cash flow from operating activities. That's OCF. And that's just like we said here, OCF. And so you can see net income for the year. We've got a number there. And guess what? Just like we just did adjustment for amortization and depreciation, right? And so all these adjustment items are in here, and you don't even need to understand all of this stuff. You just need to know that OCF comes from net income, and then it gets adjusted based on amortization, depreciation, all these other items, and that gives us our end OCF cash flow from operating activities. So this company put $115,402 into the bank from how they ran the business. So originally, we said, well, it doesn't seem like that great of a business, because not too much has moved on the balance sheet. But I don't know, maybe this story is a little bit different. $115,000 in OCF, that's, that's more than they did the year before. So that's pretty that's exciting, okay? So that's a plus, right? So let's look at ICF cash flow from investing activities, acquisition of property, plant equipment, disposal. So that's selling property, plant and equipment, selling investments, right? And then right. So then that comes over here, right? So that's over here in terms of our, whoops, our ICF right there, which, in our case, in our example, we had software. Then we've got cash flow from financing activities, repayments to the shareholders. So if there's a shareholder loan right, or acquisition of long term debt right now, there's, there's more different lines of possible things that could go in here. But in this business, there was just these two, just like up here, there's other possible items that could go in here. This is, these are just the only relevant items that this business actually put in place. And so if we take a look, we can see cash flow from financing activities. Oh, so OCF is here, where was that bottom line? So cash flow from operating activities is their cash flow from investing activities is there. And cash flow and this right here is cash flow from financing activities. I don't know why it doesn't say right there, but that's what it is. Lo and behold, if we do 78,005 whoops, I'm sorry. Oh yeah. This is the other thing about statement of cash flows, man, this always just drives me crazy. Whereas we have start cash at the top and end cash at the bottom, which makes a lot of sense, starting at the top and ending at the bottom, and then the three, OCF, ICF, FCF in the middle. Accounting Software always puts beginning cash at the bottom and then end cash right next to it. So beginning of the year, they had it looks like negative $69,474 then all this up here happened. OCF. F ICF and FCF, and then they ended the year here at 11, 552, do you guys see how that flow goes? It's making sense. Okay, good. So if we now look at the beginning of the year negative 69, 474, that means the ending balance sheet at June 30. The ending balance sheet on June 30, 2002 should be that same number. And let's just see June 30, 2002 and we might have to do some calculations here, and tomorrow, we might even go and do that. But if we take a look bank loan of 80 bank, yeah, we're running out of time. I'm getting a little bit rushed now, so at any rate, I just wanted to quickly share, you know, we can answer more questions tomorrow and whatnot. You now have seen in some real financials where the exact items of diamond financials are located and in a page like this operating expenses that list all the different so this is, this is kind of just bulk. It's just kind of like extra documents inside the financials that don't absolutely need to be there. They're helpful if you wanted to know more about that topic. But if you take a look at this operating expenses in 2002 for June 30. Oh, 1-202-280-6817,

Unknown Speaker  31:28
if we look right here,

Speaker 1  31:31
286 817, same number, operating expenses. And then it says, If you want more detail, go and look at the schedule. And so we scroll down, and we can see this is a schedule right here, 286, same number. This is just a breakdown. So there's sometimes in Financials, a lot of other documents that are in here, outside of what's diamond financials, just to help explain things more, so that you can dig into it if you need to. Okay, great. I got a second version of sample financials. If we need to, we can look at them tomorrow. We've got them handy. They're laid out a little bit differently, but at the end of the day, guys just know that it's just these three documents, balance sheet, income statement, statement of cash flows. And if you can go in there and kind of sift and sort through the weeds and find the pieces that you need, you can absolutely build it. And it's not that this stuff is unnecessary. It's just sometimes not the highest level information that we need to do our highest level kind of comprehension. So five minutes left in the day today. Two quick things. Number one, a couple pieces of homework, if you'd like to do them tonight. Number one, please grab three years financials like we talked about, which is four balance sheets and three income statements and three statements of cash flows. Please also consider doing a cash flow forecast. Now. It's not going to stop you moving forward in the course if you don't do a cash flow forecast, whereas you might be a little hampered if you don't have three years financials by Wednesday. Okay. Also a scratch balance sheet, right? A scratch balance sheet for your business, and then a scratch balance sheet for your own personal finance, if you you'll get as much out of this course as you put into it. And those are homework items that you can do to get some clarity. Now, the one other thing was actually setting up bank accounts if you wanted, again, you don't have to do that today. You could do that maybe later in the week. And then also your own free cash in your business, the free cat, the cash that you've got in the bank account, how much that is actually free cash. If we take out very short term debt, if we take out unearned earnings, if we take out deposits, if we take out all those items I talked about, and it's also in your booklet, how much free cash do you actually have? So those are the homework items. Of all those homework items, you don't you're not going to be blocked from moving forward in the course. If you don't do any of them, you'll be reduced in potency if you don't get the financials by Wednesday, which is in two days from now. Now, obviously, if you do do as more as much the homework as you do tonight, you can come back with questions tomorrow, and I can answer them when we have Q and A tomorrow. Okay, we got a question. Yes. Go ahead. Lauren,

Speaker 4  34:15
another mechanic, question, Should our balance sheet be a PDF or an Excel spreadsheet,

Speaker 1  34:22
um, if I can accept either, and you'll find that it'll be easier to work with if it's in Excel or Google Sheets for that matter. Cool. Yeah. Thank you. Good. Thank you. Same with your income statement. Save your Statement of Cash Flows, all your documents. Okay, so we got two minutes left. Let's rapid fire, and let's do our best to be timely so you can end right on time is each person, if you can. Let's go around and let's just hear what was your top takeaway from today. Don't need a full explanation. Just pretty laser focused. What was your top takeaway from today? It's.

Speaker 8  35:00
Yeah, for me, it's to not rush when looking at these numbers and really kind of get all the information and see the dates and everything what we're looking at, instead of jumping right in and trying to make things

Unknown Speaker  35:15
happen. Awesome. Thank you, Peter, who's next?

Speaker 2  35:17
So my biggest takeaway is that I've been trying to run my business for the last decade, looking at only part of the picture and I'm missing a whole another piece of information that would have made it so much easier to be making decisions. Awesome. Thank you. Who's next?

Speaker 6  35:38
I love the cash flow forecast. Nice. And do you have, like, the template for us too? Because I know I was gone for like two hours. Did you show us any kind of templates while I was gone?

Unknown Speaker  35:54
Yes, yeah, and I'll make sure that those are distributed.

Speaker 2  35:56
You bet. Thanks. Who's next? I

Unknown Speaker  36:04
I love the whole aspect of

Unknown Speaker  36:09
Hello, hello, yeah, go ahead.

Speaker 5  36:15
Okay. I love the whole aspect of not having to be like the person that does it all, but just knows a little bit of the kind of process and helping to make, like, the big decisions, overarching decisions when it comes to your company. So I love that aspect of it. Yes, it's definitely not my genius, but it's, it's good to have

Speaker 1  36:41
amazing yeah? And if you know the first 1% you can lead someone who that is their zone of genius and have a very educated conversation. I love that. Alonta Way to go. Okay, let's keep going. I want to make sure we wrap up ASAP. Yeah, Brandon, go ahead. I'm

Speaker 3  36:54
looking forward to making decisions with this knowledge instead of just, I wouldn't say winging it, but trusting someone who's playing the part of CFO, and not necessarily knowing how to double check or make sure that we're on the same page and on the same page. So I'm looking forward to that. Very much. Amazing. Thank you. Brandon,

Unknown Speaker  37:15
how about you? Taryn,

Speaker 10  37:18
I'm understanding now why sometimes my assets, we take it as one chunk, as a tax deduction versus amortization every year based on my income for that year for tax deduction.

Unknown Speaker  37:31
So that's awesome. Thank you very good. Who's next?

Speaker 9  37:37
The crisis, crisis line and pushing, pushing out of the red, and also bloat all good information.

Speaker 1  37:47
Everything's okay, the crisis line and bloat good. Thank you. Debbie Reynolds, okay, awesome. Was that Brandon, who's speaking next?

Unknown Speaker  37:56
Who else was that? Who's

Unknown Speaker  37:57
next? Oh, Chris, go ahead. Chris,

Speaker 11  37:59
yeah, just getting good optics on everything to make a far, far better decision. Seeing awesome, seeing where you are, seeing the path ahead, yep, mapping it out.

Speaker 1  38:12
Amazing you're gonna love the coming days, my friend, you're gonna absolutely love it. Yeah, you bet. Okay, who's next?

Speaker 12  38:19
I can foresee having a far more coherent conversation with my CPA in the future, and neither of us giving each other side eye, because one of us doesn't know what the other one's talking

Speaker 1  38:32
about, I feel like you just said a lot in one sentence. Mark, thank you for speaking for so many of us. Okay, got a couple left, at least what we got, Pablo, if you're still there, and Brandon and Deb Jaeger, who's next.

Speaker 13  38:51
I really like the end there. Tim, like just the elementary way of breaking down the balance sheet and the cash flow statement, that was pretty, pretty simple. So I definitely just using the numbers more with more education to make better decisions. For sure,

Speaker 14  39:08
awesome. I am learning so much, and I'm also realizing I don't know a lot. So I'm looking forward to watching the rest of the two hours that I missed. And I'm really looking forward to being responsible for this as well and making decisions together responsibly for business. 100%

Speaker 1  39:30
Yeah, and good on you for both being at the same spot, the same language, the same skills. That's super powerful. Big time, big time fight avoider and big time vision creator, which is really great. That's awesome. You bet did we hear from everybody? I'm feeling nervous that. Did we hear from Jim?

Speaker 15  39:50
Yeah, I'm here. I'd like to cash flow statement a lot. That was really worthwhile. Something you did a free seminar, and I was using it before. Really cool for. Me, and I also like the diamond financials over. Really cool too. So a lot of good stuff today. Appreciate it, amazing,

Speaker 1  40:07
awesome. Well, thank you everybody. I've been out of integrity to end at 603, so please apologize. I apologize. Please forgive me for the three minutes. If there's any impact on you, please let me know tomorrow morning, we'll start at 9am just like we did today, zoom with tim.com and tonight, as soon as zoom gets the recordings downloaded, I'll put them in a Google document, as per ms Goldstein suggestion, and after that, we'll send that out to everybody. If you need anything else, just send me a quick message, email me, text me something like that, and we can take it from there,

Speaker 4  40:42
yep. For the diamond, we need the income statement. Is that the same as the P L, yes.

Speaker 1  40:49
Income Statement is a profit and loss statement is a P L, yeah. Exact same thing. Thank you. Good okay. Thank you, everybody.

Unknown Speaker  40:58
