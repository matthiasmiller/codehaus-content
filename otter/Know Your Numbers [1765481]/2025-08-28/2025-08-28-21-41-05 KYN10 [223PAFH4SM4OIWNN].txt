Speaker 1  00:04
Maybe zoom is struggling to hold everyone in rooms right now.

Speaker 2  00:12
Yeah, my videos lagging hard, like I don't see any movement on videos.

Unknown Speaker  00:24
It's like Tim's rejoining.

Unknown Speaker  00:39
How you doing? Peter

Speaker 2  00:41
good. Jason, how are you liking? Austin,

Speaker 1  00:44
I love it nice. I don't really get out much though, so, but I maybe I will once, um, we're allowed to, once

Unknown Speaker  00:58
we're not locked in our once we're not grounded anymore.

Speaker 1  01:03
It really hasn't changed what I do, though. The only thing that's different is Instacart is taking longer, so I'm kind of an introvert and work from home anyway. So

Unknown Speaker  01:18
Okay, can you hear me again? Yeah? Tim,

Unknown Speaker  01:22
okay,

Speaker 3  01:25
so I was kicked out. I was kicked out. Lauren couldn't get in, Mark, Mark Willis couldn't get in.

Unknown Speaker  01:37
Peter and I were just chatting away. Okay? We survived.

Speaker 3  01:44
Yeah, Brandon was kicked out. Oh my goodness. Deb was kicked out. I think Deb and Brandon are back. Deb and Brandon are back. I'm not seeing Quinn, I'm not seeing

Unknown Speaker  02:06
we're back. Yeah,

Speaker 3  02:08
Deb and Brandon are back. Okay. Mark Willis, can you hear us? A okay, just wanted to check in on you.

Speaker 3  02:19
Says, Mark Willis, is in. I'm not seeing Quinn. I'm Deborah Reynolds. Deborah Reynolds is there. Hopefully, maybe you can say hello, Deborah.

Speaker 4  02:30
I don't know if this was the thing, but I updated my zoom, and that was the only way I could get back in

Speaker 5  02:36
to update it. Yeah. I think there's a lot of people on right now? Yeah, I think it just got really slower all of a sudden this session.

Unknown Speaker  02:51
Okay, I see So,

Unknown Speaker  02:57
okay,

Speaker 3  03:00
says it's still recording. Mark Griffey, yep, so I think we're safe there. Let's, let's maybe do an old school roll call here, just to see who can hear me who can't. And I'll keep admitting people in more and more as they come through. So Peter Lee, just audio. Can you, can you hear me? Or can you, yeah, yeah, okay. Deb can you say? Debbie Egger, can you say, hello, hello, loud and clear. Okay. Jason Hall, hi, good. Deborah Reynolds, yes, I'm here. Thank you. Lauren, hi, good. Okay. Quinn, can you say hello, let's see if that's working.

Speaker 6  03:44
Yep, I think it's working. So it was on my end. It was on my end. I thought it was on my end. It was trying to get back.

Speaker 3  03:52
We suddenly had a zoom pocalypse, where, okay, yeah, yeah, uh huh, yeah, we had a zoompocalypse

Speaker 7  04:05
recommendation just for everybody. Is like, it works better if everybody closes their video down, except for Tim, and then leave the audio open,

Speaker 3  04:18
strip some bandwidth. Sure. Okay, okay. Mark Griffey, can you just say hello? Yep, I'm here. Thank you, Mark. Mark Willis, I still haven't heard from Mark Willis. Mark Willis, if you can hear us, can you please

Unknown Speaker  04:36
say hello, going once, going twice. Hopefully.

Speaker 3  04:39
Okay, well, hopefully that can get sorted out, Mark, if you come back online, please do say hello. I've heard from Quinn. We've heard from Mark Griffey. We've heard from Lauren. Jim. Can you please say hello?

Unknown Speaker  04:52
Yep, I'm here. I hear you.

Speaker 3  04:54
Okay, good. Thank you, Jim. We heard from Jason Hall. I. Denise, can you say hello? Yep, I'm here. All right, thank you so much. You heard from Peter Lee. We heard from Brandon Jones, Chris, yeah, okay. All right, we're back up to 13. Hmm, we lost a few people, and I'm a little bit at a crossroads about what to do here. We are missing Taryn. We are missing alonto and his partner and Pablo. I don't know if Pablo came back today at all. He might have been, he hasn't been on Desiree,

Unknown Speaker  05:50
okay, thank you.

Unknown Speaker  05:51
Thank you. See if they've survived the zoompocalypse. And Jason,

Speaker 1  06:04
yeah, go ahead, Denise. I was gonna say I lost my co host ability to Okay, let's put that back.

Speaker 3  06:15
Okay, so Denise should be co host. Great, Jason, thanks to the status update on status.zoom.us. Says everything is operational. Okay. I know when I got kicked out, it said there was an error messages, like error 3003 like, some error code, so there was some breakdown. Maybe it was just on my installation. Yeah. Yeah, okay, we've got Taryn back now, so that's exciting. Taryn is back. Taryn, we had a big breakdown where I got kicked out. Bunch of people got kicked out, and we had to pause so so Taryn, one thing we're doing is we're actually removing our video, so it's just audio for everyone, except for me, and then that way we can lighten up the bandwidth and hopefully keep this thing going. Okay, well, I'm going to make the I guess, the choice to keep moving here, if someone has made it this far and or has watched the recordings up until this point, it's not that much further to get through these last two builds, and I think we can get through the next three bill builds in the next 27 minutes, which would keep us right on time, right on path for today's session. So let's get back to it. It appears not I should do something about that. I should do something about that. Thank you. Deborah Reynolds, okay, all right. So I know we had a variety of people dropping out at different times due to zoom and Denise, if you can please watch to see if anyone else joins the meeting. If you can let them in, that would be fantastic. So quick recap. What we were talking about, and Peter is working through, is we were really kind of so obviously the start balance sheet is same as the ending balance sheet. So that's all clear. On the income statement is the first time that we've actually broken down expenses into I'm on the wrong slide. Here we go. On the right slide. Now we actually broke expenses down into two different categories, so we've got revenue, which is the same as before. We now actually have a direct cost here, and we now have got a new line on here called gross profit. So what I was just drawing here is we've got revenue minus cost of goods sold equals gross profit. Gross profit minus overhead equals net profit. So what that looks like up here is we've got revenue, which is revenue minus cost of goods sold, which is our shirt, expenses for $10,000 equals gross profit. So 650 minus 10 is 640 then we take gross profit for 640 which is gross profit, there we take off the overhead. We know overhead is 540 because we said so up here overhead of 546, 40 minus, 540. Gives us earnings of 110 I'm sorry, 100 the 100 comes over here to earnings. We had to adjust for depreciation, because it's as we said, before depreciation is a non cash expense. It's an expense that happened, in a sense, because no cash left, but it was just kind of on paper. There was an expense. It makes earnings look under reported, in a sense. Now, believe me, earnings, this is the right number. This. $100,000 of earnings. This is the accurate number to be fair in terms of the cash story, though we gotta, we gotta put the $10,000 back. So that's why we put the $10,000 back right there to just for depreciation to our earnings, which would take us to 110 and then we also have to adjust for inventory plus $10,000 as well. Because at our cost, not market value, but at book value. At book value, it was $10,000 market value was 40 our book value, what we paid wholesale cost to acquire the shirts in the first place is $10,000 and to reiterate, the reason all of this is an OCF. And even though we, in air quotes, invested into inventory, a really clean way to think about this, this just dawned on me over the break, is inventory comes into our business and leaves the business right. The T shirts come into the business and leave the business. Things that we invest into, do not leave the business, right? So, like I was sharing, if we've got a loom that weaves textiles, you know, different, like material used for shirts or whatnot, the loom doesn't leave the business. It stays in our business. The cotton that comes in, though, is unfinished, is raw goods, inventory. And then as it goes through the loom, it becomes now finished goods, inventory. Then as we sell it, it goes out the door. And so if it leaves its OCF, if it doesn't leave its ICF, because it stays inside the business, okay, so now, so we know the number is $10,000 because it was our amount. So it's 10,000 not 40. And logically, I find the adjustment for inventory is a little bit tougher to wrap my head around. I do, however, know that it's a positive number that we have to adjust for inventory when we sell over here, we got to put it back here and and I believe the reason why, if I do the junk, the mental gymnastics in my brain, is because here we've got $10,000 like, in essence, it's almost like we're double counting it, because there's 10 inside of the 40, and so we get need to adjust to put it back properly. Is it okay if we just leave it at that? Or do we really need to drill deeper into this? Can Can we just keep moving forward? I'm good. Peter's good. Okay, Peter, so keep, keep rolling.

Speaker 2  12:40
Cool. So that brings our operating cash flow to 120

Unknown Speaker  12:48
Okay, great.

Speaker 2  12:50
And our beginning cash is 350 from before, from the previous balance sheet, okay? And then for distribution. So that's minus 40,000 because we paid off 40,000 in dividends, okay? And our loan is a minus 20,000 because we paid off 20,000 of the loan.

Unknown Speaker  13:17
And why is it negative? Because it left the business,

Speaker 2  13:22
awesome. Distribution should be negative too, because it left the business. Thank you. So the FCS, FCF is going to be minus 60,000 Okay, and then the end cash is going to be 350,000 plus 120,000 plus zero, minus 60,000

Speaker 3  14:00
Okay, so three, 350 plus 120 is what?

Unknown Speaker  14:05
So it's gonna be 470

Unknown Speaker  14:07
Okay, and then plus or minus zero,

Speaker 2  14:11
and then minus so yeah, plus or minus zero, minus 60,000 which brings us to 410 Okay,

Speaker 5  14:19
I have a quick question on the inventory, how do we get that? Is that a plus 10,000 adjust for the inventory? I missed that part. Sorry.

Speaker 3  14:29
Sure. So, so we need to so like we adjust for so coming from earnings. Earnings comes over here. We adjust for depreciation there, and the adjustment for inventory is because, it's because the money left the business for inventory back here, right? If you remember, we bought the inventory here, so cash left the business here. Right, right here. Oh, this is it, guys. This is super simple. This shirt expense is a non cash expense, just like depreciation was, is a non cash expense. This expense cash, this $10,000 didn't actually leave the business this year it left up here. And that's, that's the rule of thumb. First statement of cash flows. Did the money lead the business? Or no, just like with our software, this $1,000 of expenses left like three years earlier. So two is true of our of our T shirt inventory purchase. It happened previously. So this expense is a not it's actually a non cash expense in this year. So that's why we got to put it back over here, over here.

Speaker 5  15:53
So not to go down a rabbit hole the depreciation, but when I've done a depreciation with my rental properties and things, I think of a negative. I think of depreciating it down by deducting that 10,000 so I guess where I get confused is the fact that you're already adding that $10,000 appreciate depreciation into the, you know, the overhead like the like example, is the overhead expenses of the 540 it's already including that 10k depreciation for the software, where I would probably do 530 and then move the 530 across, and then, I guess, add it or deduct it, that's where I get. That's where I'm like, when I think of appreciation, I think of negative so I think it's not so much, it's I'm more confused with how, instead of that, I get it.

Speaker 3  16:39
Yeah, you're confusing balance sheet items with income statement items, and you're also confusing. Confusing sounds critical, so I apologize for that. Let's just say it's undistinguished to the level that it could be your your balance sheet with your income statement, and it's undistinguished to the level it needs to be between earnings and cash. Okay, so what I mean to say is, when we depreciate a property or a car or a piece of equipment, we're talking about the value and so yes, this software is going down in value from $20,000 on the balance sheet here to 20 to $10,000 here to $0 here. Spoiler alert, right? So your property value is going to go down negative, right? The value of the asset is negative from one year to the next as it depreciates, as it marches down this table, okay, 12345, what we haven't put on this, on this little amortization table, a physical asset would be a depreciation table is we didn't say Like, end value of asset. So, so we could put a third swim lane here. That says value of asset, $50,000 at Year Zero. 40,000 at the end of year 130, 2010, zero. Okay, and that's the that's the value of the property going down. Thank you. Which you're welcome, which is different than the income statement. This income statement is, what is our activity, all the screwing around that we scurrying around, that we do, not screwing around, scurrying around that we do in the business activity, not value of assets. Good. Okay. Peter, keep rolling.

Speaker 2  18:42
Yeah, so our cash is going to be 410,000 Okay? Software is going to be 10,000 because it depreciated a year. Yes. And inventory is going to be 10,000 because that's how much we have left

Speaker 3  19:02
right, because we had, we had, what? We had 20 shirts, $20,000 in inventory. We sold $5 we sold 2000 shirts, and our COGS is $5 that's $10,000 so, yes, inventory is down to 10,000

Speaker 2  19:24
the loan is at zero now, because we paid off 20,000

Speaker 3  19:29
and it was previously at 20,000 Okay, perfect. So loan is at zero.

Unknown Speaker  19:34
So liabilities zero.

Unknown Speaker  19:38
Liabilities is zero.

Unknown Speaker  19:40
Okay,

Unknown Speaker  19:45
and then the previous equity was 370,000

Unknown Speaker  19:50
Okay, got it,

Unknown Speaker  19:54
and our earnings was 100,000 Okay? And our distribution was minus 40.

Unknown Speaker  20:04
Distribution is minus 40. Okay, so if we put those two numbers together,

Unknown Speaker  20:12
so three,

Unknown Speaker  20:18
so that's 330 or no? Sorry, 430

Speaker 3  20:25
so 474 430 you said, Yes, okay.

Speaker 4  20:33
Why is it not three? I mean 230 because didn't the earnings come out? Oh, just kidding. Never mind. I'm thinking dividends.

Unknown Speaker  20:46
Okay, so keep going. Pete,

Speaker 2  20:51
so yeah, right now, then the so the assets is going to be cash. So it's 410 Yep, plus the software, so it's 420 plus the inventory, so it's 430

Unknown Speaker  21:13
Oops. Okay,

Speaker 2  21:19
so then if we were to check it so assets minus liabilities, that's 430 minus zero is 430 equity. And then if we added the 370 plus the earnings, which is 100 minus the 40, it equals to 430

Speaker 3  21:36
There you go. Round of applause for Peter job buddy. Well done. Well done. If people's video is on, you'd be able to see them plotting as well. Yes, good job. Okay, perfect, good, good, good. Let's keep moving. Who's going to do our eighth and final build? Our eighth and final build? This is Quinn here. I can do it. Quinn, okay. Quinn is stepping up to the plate. Taryn says, can't see me. I'm gonna leave my video off. I think for a moment, guys. Taryn, thank you for mentioning that. Okay, Quinn, let's tell us what happened.

Speaker 6  22:19
All right, so the balance sheet at the beginning on the top is already filled out for us. What happened is revenue of 700,000 commission of 100,000 overhead of 550 1000, 10,000 account receivable, 20,000 account payable, 100,000 affiliate commission and no dividend, okay, so, so I'm actually, I have a clarify, clarifying question here. So the 100,000 affiliate commission, according to this and the,

Speaker 3  22:59
sorry, the sorry, the Internet was dropping. What did you say?

Speaker 6  23:03
The affiliate commission of $100,000 in on here. It's not clear if it's paid out already or is, is it already still owing? That's my question. Oh,

Speaker 3  23:16
good question. Okay, so it's an expense, and it's an expense. And let's just see, here we are, yeah, it's a really good clarifying question. And we are, we are. We have not paid it. It happened. It's an expense that happened during the year, was affiliate commission, and by the end of the year, we have not paid it. So let me just just add a little That's it. That's an excellent, excellent question. Right on the

Speaker 6  23:50
right where it says statement of cash flow, it is saying that the commission is still owing. So that's why I'm assuming that this piece should be should have some clarification here. Yeah,

Speaker 3  23:59
right. Yeah, good. Thank you. That's a pro. That's a pro. Good job. You're you're demonstrating your expertise. This is excellent.

Speaker 6  24:09
Okay, and then on the note included in the 700,000 revenue is the 10,000 of account receivable. Okay, I'm ready to play.

Unknown Speaker  24:19
Okay? Showtime. Quinn. Let's do it all.

Unknown Speaker  24:21
Right, so revenue is 700k

Unknown Speaker  24:32
direct cost commission is 100k

Unknown Speaker  24:36
That's the affiliate commission,

Speaker 6  24:38
yep. Okay, and gross profit is 600,000 okay? And overhead expenses is 550 1000. So earnings is 50,000 Okay?

Unknown Speaker  25:00
Okay, and how did you get that number?

Speaker 6  25:02
I take 700 minus 100 minus 550

Speaker 3  25:07
right? So 700 minus 100 600 600 minus 550 is 50. Okay, great. Keep going.

Speaker 6  25:18
Okay, so statement of cash flows, beginning cash is 410 1000, sorry, 410,000

Unknown Speaker  25:26
and you got that from up here. Yeah. Okay, great.

Unknown Speaker  25:31
Operating. So for earnings, it's 50,000

Unknown Speaker  25:35
Okay.

Unknown Speaker  25:37
Adjustment for depreciation is plus 10k 10k

Unknown Speaker  25:43
and and why is that?

Speaker 6  25:45
Because, for the it's a non cash expense for software. So we're just adding it

Speaker 3  25:49
back. Very well said, You sound like a pro. Quinn, good job. Keep going.

Speaker 6  25:55
I'm loving this. And adjustment for account receivable, account receivable, so basically, account receivable means we we already put it in the revenue, but we didn't receive it yet, so we're going to take minus 10 out of that. So minus 10 on the adjustment for account receivable, minus 10,000 Okay, okay. And then so and then adjustment for account payable is plus 20,000 because we didn't pay it out yet. It's still just

Unknown Speaker  26:26
it's cash expense,

Speaker 6  26:32
okay? And then the adjustment for commission owed is plus 100,000 because that, again, is not paid out yet, so it's a non cash All right, so finance is zero. Distribution is zero.

Speaker 3  26:55
Finance zero and yes, yes and yes. Let me grab this. Oh, shoot, okay, and you said distribution is zero, yes, okay,

Speaker 6  27:13
okay, so N Cash is 580,000

Unknown Speaker  27:19
How did you get that number.

Speaker 6  27:22
Oh, sorry, so the at the top, where it says OCF, that amount is 170 so I take 50 plus 10 minus 10 plus 20 plus 100 then it becomes 170 K for the OCF. Okay, okay. And then the end cash is basically beginning 410, plus 170, equals 580

Speaker 3  27:49
plus zero is 580 plus zero is 580 Yes,

Unknown Speaker  27:53
okay,

Speaker 3  28:01
okay, so, Quinn, you have a you have a ton of momentum right now. You are rolling full steam ahead. You're totally crushing it. You're getting everything correct. And I need to check in with the rest of everyone else, because folks may be a little just need a second to catch up on the AR, AP conversation is, would it be okay if I do that. Quinn, absolutely, okay, good stuff. Okay, so accounts receivable is when someone so when you've if when you've sold something. So remember sales, sold earnings, earned cash, collected. You sold the thing, you've performed the service or sent the product. So therefore you've now earned it as well, but you haven't gotten the cash yet. You haven't gotten the cash yet. So on your income statement, you've sold it and you've earned it, but you haven't gotten the cash yet. So that's why, if it's $10,000 of accounts receivable right here. That means that this earnings number is going to be $10,000 higher than the cash number, because we haven't been paid yet. So that's why this number is, in a sense, once it comes over, is going to be overstated by $10,000 so that's why this is negative $10,000 Accounts Payable is just the opposite. Accounts Payable is when someone when, when we've agreed to buy something, we've agreed to a future, we've agreed to an expense, and we've received the shipment of the product, or we've received the service, and we just haven't sent the cash yet. That's what accounts payable is. And so because we haven't sent the cash yet, there's going to be a difference between the earnings because. It's, it's like, theoretically, we've incurred the expense, however, we haven't sent the cash yet. So this number is going to be lower than what our actual cash is we're gonna have, because we're gonna have $20,000 more in the bank than we should. This number needs to be $20,000 higher than it should, because relative to earnings. So that's why $20,000 Accounts Payable is plus 20,000 now we'll go another step further. We haven't paid the commission yet, this $100,000 in commission, and so if so, we incurred the expense of the Commission, which is right here. And so for this year, we had an expense. We had we had commit this activity happened in this year. So it was $100,000 expense to pay our affiliates, the people who sent us customers. We haven't paid them yet, and so our bank is going to have $100,000 more in it, then our income statement will show and so that means the earnings number needs to go up by $100,000 when we adjust it to bring it over so it matches our bank account. This is such a classic situation, you guys, where an entrepreneur might get to the end of the year. And remember, this is, you know, till December 31 so it's till the end of the year. Our end cash says $580,000 that means on December 31 if I were to log into my online banking, I would see $580,000

Speaker 4  31:43
and I go, dang, I am, I am in the money.

Speaker 3  31:51
However, we've completely forgotten. We've completely forgotten that we have accounts payable of $20,000 here, which is for services, and we have another account payable, which is the Commission's that we need to pay up here. So we actually have $120,000 in accounts payable. But if we were just making decisions based on what we see in our online banking, we'd think we have, we'd have all 580 to be able to play with when, in fact, in cash is not our free cash. Number out of this 580 we would have to subtract payables, right? You've got 20 here. Got 100 there. So we'd have to take this down by at least 120 just because of payables. We haven't talked about unearned revenue, we haven't talked about ultra short term debt. We haven't talked about deposits, right, or any of the other pieces that that come out of cash to get us to free cash. Okay? Are we? Are we okay with this, adjusting, these adjustments here, or, or I should ask this differently, are we okay enough that we can keep moving forward? Deborah, Reynolds, is okay. Jason says, honored. I'm sorry. Who is speaking up. I

Unknown Speaker  33:08
was just gonna say, Okay.

Speaker 3  33:11
Brandon, okay, thank you, awesome. Okay. Mark Willis says, Okay, great. Thank you, Mark. Okay, so let's now get to this ending balance sheet, Quinn, and take us to the very end, and if we end up getting it done in a minute, then we'll end right on time.

Unknown Speaker  33:25
Okay, so it's on me to end on

Speaker 3  33:27
time. It's all on you. Yeah, that's right. 100% on

Speaker 6  33:31
you, yeah, all right. So cash is 580 1000, yep. Software is now zero because

Speaker 3  33:39
it's fully depreciated, yes, or amortized, I should say, yeah, go ahead.

Unknown Speaker  33:44
And then inventory, there's still 10,000

Unknown Speaker  33:48
that's the T shirts, okay?

Unknown Speaker  33:50
And then account receivable, there's 10,000

Speaker 3  33:54
that's the money that other people owe to us. Okay, keep going.

Speaker 6  33:57
Okay. Account payable, all sorts of so the total assets would be 600

Speaker 3  34:03
great. Okay, 600 Yeah, okay, great.

Unknown Speaker  34:07
Keep going.

Unknown Speaker  34:08
So account payable is 20,000 Okay, commissions owed is 100,000 Okay, liability is 120, 1000.

Unknown Speaker  34:27
Okay, great. Keep going.

Speaker 6  34:29
Previous equity is 430, 1000,

Unknown Speaker  34:33
and that comes from the previous balance sheet.

Speaker 6  34:34
Kate earnings is 550, 1000,

Speaker 3  34:38
which comes from there? Distribution, zero distribution is zero.
