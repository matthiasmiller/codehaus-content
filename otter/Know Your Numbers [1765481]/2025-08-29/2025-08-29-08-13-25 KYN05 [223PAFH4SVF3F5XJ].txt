Speaker 1  00:01
So as promised, I promise I'd answer the question about where my diplomatic Ness comes from. And honestly, the first and biggest piece is the fact I'm Canadian. That is definitely the first and biggest piece. No question about that. The second, if you can see that picture there, the sun kind of has some reflection on it. But when I was 17 years old, I worked in the House of Commons in Ottawa. Ottawa is like Washington, DC, except for Canada, it's this country's capital, and we also our House of Commons is like your house of representatives. So like, I got to work directly with the Prime Minister of Canada, very cool. And actually I worked with four different Prime Ministers while I was there, which is great. So when you're in that environment, you hear about, hear a lot of diplomatic things said a lot of diplomatic ways. And while I was there, I actually even sworn oath of secrecy to the Queen, which was very cool to kind of have that level of, like, kind of security. And the third thing that has me say certain things in diplomatic ways is I was, I was in a board meeting, and and Keith Cunningham was there, and I gave some feedback in a situation, and he actually pulled me to the side afterwards and said, Tim, if you're going to be that rough with people, you're going to get nowhere. And he very expertly guided me to check out a book called NVC, nonviolent communication. Nonviolent Communication. Beautiful, beautiful methodology. It's pretty tough to do all the time, but NVC it basically, it's, it's a very compassionate style of communication. And the the Creator, Dr Rosenstein, I think is his name. Just look it up, nonviolent communication. Rosenberg, thank you. Marshall Rosenberg, yes, he, you know, he said every judgment we make of others is actually the tragic expression of an unmet need that we have in ourselves and his his pure pursuit for compassion is really mind blowing. So his family is Jewish, and he actually once put out a video, I think this is in the 80s, of his empathy and compassion for Adolf Hitler. Oh, my God. Now having compassion is different than condoning obviously, Marshall Rosenberg is not saying, You know what? It makes a lot of sense and thumbs up the Holocaust. Good choice. Like he's clearly not saying that. He is, however, saying, you know, when Hitler was in art school, he didn't have a need for acceptance, or when he tried to get into art school, his need for acceptance was not met, and then this other thing happened, his need for the other thing wasn't met, and his need for the other thing wasn't met. And when you actually stack it all up, it's actually shades of gray increase. Incredibly, you're like, you know what? It's actually not that big of a leap to see that he did what he did doesn't make it okay. It does, however, create an unders, a sense of a context of compassion. And so through all of that, something I learned in some in some instances the hard way, is the moment that we have someone in their amygdala, that we have someone in their fight or flight center of their brain, the moment they are no longer in the executive functioning, they're no longer in the creative problem solving part of their brain, and they're now completely unproductive. And so to be so confronting with people, usually will will generate a good result in the immediate moment, but a very, very bad result in the medium to long term. And those of you, the people who are closer to me, you know, including Denise on this call. I've been a friend of Peter for 10 years. You guys probably have a long list of examples how I am not a compassionate communicator at times, and I am confronting and not as clean and thoughtful and well spoken and nonetheless, it doesn't stop me from wanting to pursue being productive in talking to people. And I'll also add that that everything I'm saying can still happen in a context of high performance. I can still be this way and still expect people to perform at a high level and hold them accountable to their promises and expect big things from myself and from others. So that's just my own management style, leadership style, that I strive for. I'm certainly not perfect at it all the time, sometimes far from it, and yet, it is the thrilling pursuit of excellence that we're here for, aren't we? The thrilling pursuit of excellence? Brandon, big thumbs up. Yeah, buddy. 100% Yeah, and Jason and Lauren, yep. Great. Okay, great. So we've had a moment for folks to get back and settled in. I am extremely proud of this next exercise that we're going to do. Lauren's been through a version of it before, and it bears worth repeating. I think if someone did this 10 times, they would still get a ton of value out of it. So well, let me share my screen in let's get the right thing up first. That would probably help. Okay, let's share my screen here in whoops, in three, two and one. Okay, great. Can you see the screen? If yes, just throw me a quick thumbs up. We're good, good, good, awesome. Thanks, everybody. I always appreciate the affirmation confirmation. So what you can see here this is you're actually already closer to understanding real financials than you realize, even though, on the screen, this is like cute little boxes Tim Drew and like Mac pages, and it's not some like export out of sage or Quicken or any other accounting software. This is conceptually, exactly what financials are. So don't sell yourself short. You're making massive progress already, massive, massive progress, and you should be proud of yourself. So just like we drew before, here's our diamond, our starting balance sheet, our ending balance sheet. We've got our income statement, our statement of cash flows. As you can see, our balance sheet has the date that the balance sheet was pulled so December 3120 13. And lo and behold, the income statement starts the very next day. So January one of 2014 is the day after December 31 2013 now on your own financials, you may see this said different ways. It may say for the period genuine to deck 31 2014 or it might just say for the year ended 20 December 31 2014 when it says for the year ended December 31 2014 that means for the whole year, which means this period, if you only see one date on it, if you only see December 31 2014 that would be a balance. A balance sheet, if it's for the year ended December 31 2014 that's a whole year. And now we're looking at either an income statement or statement of cash flows, just like I drew for you before. We've got beginning cash we've got OCF, ICF and FCS, so cash flow from operations, cash flow from investing activities and cash flow from financing activities, then our ending balance sheet is exactly the same as the beginning balance sheet. Now you're going to see as we go through this exercise, that I'm going to be adding more lines, and we're going to add more layers to this as we keep going. And we're always going to be bite sized, so there's never going to be anything too intimidating or too crazy about it. So in our very first year, in our very first by the way, if you've got this, you should have it printed. You should have it sitting in front of you. I was going to use my little overhead camera, good. Thank you everybody for having that. Thank you. I was going to have my little overhead camera and draw with you guys. But apparently, like, it's just sucking battery it faster than I can even keep up with it. So the first few here, we're just going to, like, follow on the screen. So in this very first year, what happened is, let me what happened. If you look at my mouse, we've got revenue of $100,000 expenses of 60. We borrowed 50 and we distributed nothing to the owner. So where that goes, let me make this a bit bigger so it's easier to see. And let's make this like blue or something like that. Okay, let's make it that blue. Okay, great. Now, Lauren, I'm gonna put you on the spot. Do you happen to remember this exercise well enough if you don't, no hard feelings. Do you remember

Unknown Speaker  09:24
well enough to do what?

Speaker 1  09:28
So where would we put this $100,000 of revenue? Where would that go in this whole situation,

Unknown Speaker  09:33
under revenue?

Unknown Speaker  09:37
And that's on which document,

Speaker 2  09:38
the income statement

Unknown Speaker  09:42
bingo. Income Statement revenue of $100,000

Unknown Speaker  09:46
you win. I'm stress wedding right now. Okay,

Speaker 1  09:51
that's so that's, that's amazing. Okay, now we've got another so we can, more or less, you know, kind of like, cross this off. Now, you know we've we can say that we've now taken care of revenue. Let me change the color of that. There we go. So we've now dealt with revenue that's now gone from what's happened, what else has happened? Lauren, more pressure. We we have expenses of $60,000 where would you put those, which document

Speaker 2  10:20
in which line Income Statement expenses,

Speaker 1  10:23
look at you. Go amazing. So copy and paste and our expenses go right here, and it is indeed $60,000 okay, perfect. We've covered revenue and expenses. Okay, great. So what about borrow $50,000 this is getting a little little more advanced. Borrowing $50,000 any ideas where that would go?

Unknown Speaker  10:52
FCF loan.

Speaker 1  10:53
Oh, playing life on expert mode here.

Unknown Speaker  11:00
I just pay attention most of the time.

Speaker 1  11:05
And I can confirm it's not all the time. That's that's a friendly job. That's a friendly job from, from, from some of our dinner party conversations. Ah, that's awesome. Okay, so borrow $50,000 that's taken care of. Okay, now, where would you put distribute $0

Speaker 2  11:27
under distribute FCF,

Speaker 1  11:31
yes, indeed, you got it. So our distribution is $0 so distribution is just, what do we what are we giving to the owner in most cases, that's us in small business. It could be called a dividend. It could be called the distribution, same thing. Okay, so we'll just copy that and paste that, and now we've covered all the things that have happened. Now, believe it or not, we can actually now fill out everything else on this screen just from the information that we've got. So on the scale of zero to courageous, how are you feeling? Lauren,

Unknown Speaker  12:07
I'm feeling pretty

Speaker 1  12:07
good. I'm feeling pretty good. All right. You're feeling feeling pretty good. I love it. All right. So we already have a complete starting balance sheet on December 31 2013, since inception until this moment, which maybe this business was just started. That's why it's all zeros. Or maybe by some fluke, it's been around for 300 years, and we happen to be at exactly zero either way, that is. The State of the Union is we're actually at zeros across the board. Whoops, I just stopped sharing my screen. Let me put that back. Either way, we're at zeros across the board. That's kind of like it just kind of worked out that way. Okay, great. So we have a question here from Mark Willis, why wouldn't the $50,000 loan go to liabilities on the balance sheet? Great question. So this is our beginning. I get why it went to the FCF finance. But wouldn't it also impact both liabilities and cash or assets of some kind? Because Aren't you doing something with that? Yep, and Mark, you are ahead of the curve, my friend. So thank you for saying that. And just so that I could take that wrench out of your brain, you are going to see it pop up here right away in some more places. So you got a man sorry about that. No, no, no, no problem at all. I know what it's like to learn and you'd be like but, and it just for me, it really gets in the way. So that's I'm really glad we could clear that up. Yeah, so thank you. Okay, so Lauren, we've got a complete balance sheet. We have an incomplete income statement and statement of cash flows. So now, and also keep in mind, Mark, this is where we started, at the start, and then this happened, and then you're going to see how it all plays out. So So Lauren, on our income statement, how can we figure out earnings?

Unknown Speaker  13:58
Can you subtract? Bingo?

Speaker 1  14:04
100 minus 60 is how much 4040, bingo. Okay, great, great. Now, what can we do with this 40? What have we just learned a few minutes ago of where this can now go? Bingo? Okay, so OCF is now here, awesome. Okay, great. Now, looking at the statement of cash flows, how can we get our beginning cash?

Speaker 2  14:32
It's above an asset or in cash zero,

Speaker 1  14:36
there you go. Yeah, it's zero, exactly. So beginning cash is zero, awesome. We know that there's zero ICF. We know there's so we know there's zero beginning cash. There's 40 OCF. We know there's zero investing cash flow. How do we figure out this FCF number right here?

Speaker 2  14:57
Ooh, I feel like there's. Subtraction here. Okay, maybe it's an addition.

Speaker 1  15:04
Okay, so now this is really important. It's really common to think about alone as being a negative, because it's like some people think it was, like, it's bad, so it's negative. Keep in mind, and I wouldn't be surprised if you guys have to remind yourself a few times during this exercise, statement of cash flows is, yeah, there is cash flowing into the business for any reason, any reason at all. If cash is flowing into the business, that's positive. Anytime we've got cash flowing out of the business, we have a negative. And let's say we've got a mix of the two. Let's say I borrow some money and I also pay some money back then, to Lauren's point, my loan is actually positive cash flowing in the business because I'm borrowing money, it's coming into the business. So that would be a positive, and let's say it's positive 100 not in this, not what you're seeing on the screen, but let's just say, theoretically, if I had 100 come in, and then from there, I also, in the same year, or the same period, paid 50 out, that would be negative 50. I'd be left with a net of 50. And that's what would show up on our statement of cash flows. So So Lauren is correctly identified. It's positive 50 because the loan money came into the business. We did not send any money out, okay, in a distribution. So Lauren, what is 50 plus zero?

Unknown Speaker  16:25
50,000

Speaker 1  16:29
awesome, very good. So how can we figure out in cash

Unknown Speaker  16:33
now add 40 and 50

Unknown Speaker  16:36
plus? What else

Speaker 2  16:39
plus? Ooh, the beginning cash,

Speaker 1  16:45
and yet you're almost there and the investments Exactly, we go zero beginning cash plus whatever this is positive or negative, plus this positive or negative plus this positive or negative equals in cash. So in this case, you got zero plus 40 plus zero. So zero plus 40 is 40 plus zero is still 40 plus 50 is 90. So our N Cash is 90, right there, perfect. Okay, great. So carrying on, and I'm going to zoom out just a little bit here. Question, yes, is it Quinn,

Speaker 3  17:19
yes. So what would be an example of ICF?

Speaker 1  17:24
So let's say that you wanted to invest in a piece of software, and it's not, it's not like a $50 a month software. It's like a $50,000 one time payment that you're gonna pay on software, or maybe you pay it in a couple chunks, but it's when you're making an a significant at investment into your business. Now there's, there is a a threshold, typically, that each entrepreneur will set, usually, in conversation with their account, as to what counts as a significant investment into our own business. So in my business, me buying a laptop is a significant investment. You know, it might be $1,500 because it's a MacBook Air that's upgraded, and to me, that would count as ICF, right? Whereas, for Apple, multi billion dollar company, that $1,500 laptop, that is not a big enough expense to really make a dent in their universe. And so they just consider to be an expense, and out it goes so So, Quinn, I'm going to explain more about depreciation and ICF and whatnot in an upcoming slide. Would it be okay if we kept moving forward? Yep, thank you. You're welcome. Okay, awesome, great. And Quinn, if I haven't answered your question later, then make sure to circle back, because I want to make sure no one, no one no one is left behind, and especially anyone. Okay, all right, so Lauren, how we okay? How are you doing? You gonna make it you're gonna make it. Okay. So help me fill up this balance sheet, and let's try and more or less kind of go from the top to the bottom. Okay,

Speaker 2  19:06
so the cash, the end cash goes in cash.

Speaker 1  19:11
It does right there. Yep, perfect. Thank you. The loan,

Unknown Speaker  19:19
oh, I think the loan goes in loan,

Speaker 1  19:23
yep. So we've take Yep. So just like Mark identified, we've we started here, then this happened, and so we borrowed 50,000 so yes, indeed, we gotta, we gotta put that on the balance sheet. It's a liability, and it's going right there, yep, 100% okay. Keep you doing great, Lauren, keep leading us. My God,

Speaker 2  19:47
I don't do this enough, and the first time he taught me was like two years ago. Okay, so the earnings is from the. A in income statement,

Speaker 1  20:03
yep, right there. Okay, and where would you put it under equity, equity earnings, okay, perfect. What else

Speaker 2  20:15
the equity is? Zero from the top. I think

Speaker 1  20:21
previous equity zero, Yep, you got it. Let me just copy that zero, previous equity zero,

Speaker 2  20:27
and then the distribution is also zero.

Speaker 1  20:33
That's right, yep, because we said distribute zero. So you're right.

Speaker 2  20:38
I'm really stressed, sweating a lot right now. I feel like I need to turn on my fan.

Speaker 1  20:44
Everybody just, just blow, just blowing your microphones really hard. Yeah, it'll, it'll help. Lauren, yeah,

Speaker 2  20:50
um, I wasn't expecting to be on the spot. And so then you carry, I think you just carried the numbers up a level.

Unknown Speaker  21:00
Okay, so let's do that. Let's see what happens.

Unknown Speaker  21:05
So assets would be 90

Unknown Speaker  21:09
correct,

Speaker 2  21:12
liabilities would be 50 correct. And then equity would be all three of those added together, which would be 40

Speaker 1  21:24
correct. Now, if you guys remember, we said in your personal finance, asset minus liabilities is your net worth, and we said your balance sheet is exact same thing, but just with different words, asset minus liabilities equals equity. And if you look 90 minus 50 is 40. Holy shit balls. It all worked out. Great work. Lauren, thank you. Thank you. Great. Great work now, Lauren, you've got one more task. Oh no, oh no, it's now the next year, how can we fill out, how can we fill out the beginning balance sheet? To get us

Speaker 2  22:07
started, we copy paste the balance sheet above to the balance sheet below,

Speaker 1  22:12
because it's actually the exact same damn balance sheet. December 31 2014 is December 31 2014 you're absolutely correct, everybody, let's give Lauren a round of applause. Way to go. Way to go. Well done, well done. Okay, who's our next courageous, courageous, enterprising entrepreneur who's prepared to

Unknown Speaker  22:38
what's that? Chris said he will.

Speaker 1  22:41
Chris said he will, okay. Give me just a quick moment here, whoops, let me see if I can get this to paste in here. I do not see where it went, okay. So this is where I would normally draw, and I would be much quicker. But unfortunately, we are just gonna have to live with the battery life of what's going on here. So it was 90, it was 50 and it was 40. Okay, so you guys are gonna see here that sometimes I collapse lines if I'm just trying to help you focus on different things. So our equity of 40, these three lines theoretically do exist down here, but I just took them out, because, just to make it easier to really focus on all the right pieces here. So, okay, great. So Chris, you're next. Lead us. Lead us along. Fearless leader.

Speaker 4  23:33
Okay, so we have the starting balance sheet, the assets of 90,000 liability to 50, equity of 40. What happened? We have a revenue of 150,000 expenses of 100,000 and we paid off the loan 10,000 and distributed zero. So we're going to take that revenue of 150 and put it on the revenue line on the income statement.

Unknown Speaker  23:57
Okay, great,

Speaker 4  24:01
and then I'm gonna grab that 100,000 in expenses and put it down on the expense line on the income statement. Okay, great. Then that's going to give us earnings of 50,000

Unknown Speaker  24:15
Okay, great.

Speaker 4  24:16
Then we'll jump over to the beginning as a statement of cash flows. Okay, off and grab that beginning cash of 90,000 from the balance

Speaker 1  24:25
sheet. Okay, great. Then

Speaker 4  24:29
we're going to grab that, grab the earnings 50,000 and put that in operating cash flow. Okay, great, yep. And then we're going to grab that $10,000 and put it down on loan, and it's going to be a negative, because we paid it off.

Speaker 1  24:46
Oh, well done. Yes indeed. Expert Mode, I love it negative $10,000 that is correct. Good job, Chris. And

Speaker 4  24:55
then distribute is zero, so we're going to put a zero in there.

Speaker 1  24:58
I'm. Okay, and zero, it is just like, so yep.

Speaker 4  25:06
And then we'll stick then we'll add those up, so we're gonna have minus 10,000 for the FCF.

Unknown Speaker  25:13
Okay, great.

Speaker 4  25:15
And then we'll start at the top. We've got 90,000 then we have operating cash flow of 50. So that'll take us to 140 then we got minus 10,000 so that'll give us n cash of 130,000

Speaker 1  25:28
and just for the sake of process, I want everyone to know that there's also the zero in there. So 90 plus 50, plus zero plus negative 10. Yeah, perfect. So did you say 130 Chris,

Unknown Speaker  25:41
correct, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  25:42
okay, thank you. $130,000 okay, let's you're on a roll. Let's keep going. What else?

Speaker 4  25:50
All right, so we're gonna get in the balance sheet, then we're gonna grab the live, oh, grab the assets as cash, which is 50,000

Unknown Speaker  26:02
okay?

Speaker 4  26:04
So that we might as well just put in the assets there 50, because we've got that. There's only the one

Speaker 1  26:09
sure, so let's just double check that. So how do you know that that's 50

Unknown Speaker  26:14
from the upper from the OCF and the earnings?

Speaker 1  26:18
So if you remember, we get beginning cash from the cash line here. So this cash line becomes beginning cash there, and then end cash.

Speaker 4  26:32
Oh, Okay, gotcha All right. So N Cash is 130 Yep. And then, so then assets will be 130

Unknown Speaker  26:41
Yes, sir, got it.

Speaker 4  26:43
Then we've got the loan, which is going to be because it was 50, so now it's going to be 40,000

Unknown Speaker  26:54
and how do you know that

Speaker 4  26:58
50,000 from the balance sheet. Previous we had a liabilities of 50 and we paid off 10,000 so it's going to leave us with 40,000

Speaker 1  27:07
Okay, great, awesome. So let's get that in there. Okay, and what now?

Unknown Speaker  27:16
So total liabilities would be 40,000

Speaker 1  27:19
Okay, now I'm gonna, I'm gonna quickly, I'm gonna quickly prompt you on something. We're gonna do this slightly different than last time. How could we figure out before we do the sub parts? How could we figure out the equity number

Speaker 4  27:33
assets minus liabilities, 90,000 Okay,

Speaker 1  27:37
perfect. So let's put that in right now, and I'm sorry to interrupt your flow just in it from a teaching perspective. Wanted to give people wanted to give people a chance to see it done both ways. So, okay, perfect, great. So keep going.

Speaker 4  27:47
Okay, so the previous equity and we score is 40,000

Speaker 1  27:53
Okay, so 40,000 there

Unknown Speaker  27:56
we have earnings of 50,000

Unknown Speaker  28:00
Yes, we do okay,

Unknown Speaker  28:04
and we have a distribution of zero.

Speaker 1  28:06
And what are the two places you can look to know that we have a distribution of zero, F, F, C, F, right there, yep.

Unknown Speaker  28:16
And then what happened? Yeah.

Speaker 1  28:19
And then that's just saying. So, I thought, yeah, okay, great. Okay, so let's bring that zero, let's put zero there and just distribution. Great.

Speaker 4  28:29
So is, so is the double check. If we add up previous equity, 40 earnings, 50 and distribution of zero, we get the 90,000

Speaker 1  28:37
and I love what you said there. There's always a way to double check. There's always a way to double check, and whether it's going assets minus libels equals equity or adding up all the equity amounts to give us total equity, either way, that double check is there, Chris, round of applause. Well done, my friend. Well done. Very well done. Excellent.

Speaker 4  28:56
Okay, that was actually the test you you passed. Oh,

Speaker 1  29:03
that's right, I love that. Thank you, Chris. I appreciate you keeping me on my toes. Lauren,

Unknown Speaker  29:11
Lauren, you might be muted.

Speaker 2  29:13
JK, maybe because I'm missing this, the earnings and the equity don't match.

Unknown Speaker  29:21
Okay, so earnings comes from here.

Unknown Speaker  29:26
Okay, that never mind. Gotcha,

Speaker 1  29:28
yeah, got it. Okay, good. Any other questions out there? Okay, good. Now, does everybody understand why this is why the loan is negative 10 here, and yet, when we talk about the loan here, it's positive. Can someone explain that to

Speaker 4  29:49
me? Because, Oh, you want me to go, Sure. Chris, yeah, yeah. So cash in is going to be a positive. So a plus. Yep. Cash. Cash out is going to be a negative,

Speaker 1  30:04
Perfect, good, yep, that's it. And then from there, it's got to be a positive number here, because we're doing assets minus liabilities gives us equity. So perfect. Okay, who's our next courageous leader that's going to step up and help us on this next one? Yeah? I'll go. Is that alanto, yeah. Alanto, okay, help us fill up this balance sheet. What goes on here?

Speaker 5  30:32
Okay, copy and paste from the top assets, cash, 130,000 liabilities. 40,000

Speaker 1  30:47
Okay, liabilities of 40 Okay, yep,

Unknown Speaker  30:50
same thing with the loan and equity. 90,000

Speaker 1  30:55
Okay, whoops. 90,000 Okay, great. And we might have another question here. Let me just pull that up. Okay, Ah, I see Deborah said bonus time, yes, yes, yes, yes. Deborah, awesome. I think she already said everything from this point forward was already bonus time. So she's in double bonus, maybe triple bonus. Okay, good. All right. Alonto, please lead the way.

Unknown Speaker  31:33
So revenue is soaring 50,000 Okay, $250,000 expenses to 60,000 is 260 Okay, so earnings is negative 10,000

Speaker 1  31:52
Okay, interesting, yes, it's possible to have negative earnings. That's what's called a loss, right? Negative earnings, okay, keep, keep us rolling.

Unknown Speaker  32:03
So beginning cash is 130,000

Speaker 1  32:07
Yep, pulled from the earlier balance sheet, from the starting balance sheet. Got it

Speaker 5  32:12
operational. CF is negative 10,000

Speaker 1  32:17
Yep, pulled, pulled over from earnings, yep. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  32:22
Loan is negative 10,000

Speaker 1  32:26
because we paid off a loan by another 10,000 right here. Okay, negative, negative because,

Unknown Speaker  32:36
because you're paying it off. So,

Unknown Speaker  32:39
yeah, money, is leaving the business,

Unknown Speaker  32:43
and then distribution is negative 20,000

Speaker 1  32:48
ah, indeed, because we've got money leaving the business, you've got more money leaving the business. It's leaving the business and going into the owner's pocket. It's tough sometimes for entrepreneurs to realize that they are not their business. And so when your business is sending money away, even if it's to you, even it's your own business sending it to you, it's still a negative 20, because it's leaving the business. We're talking about the businesses financials. If we're talking about your personal financials, that would be a plus, because you would have money coming in. But we're talking about your businesses, so it's a negative, got it? Okay? Alon to keep rolling.

Speaker 5  33:18
So your overall finance is negative 30,000

Unknown Speaker  33:27
Okay,

Unknown Speaker  33:28
and then your end cash is 100,000

Speaker 1  33:33
Okay, how'd you get that number 90,000 sorry, 90,000 and how'd you get that number

Speaker 5  33:38
so your beginning cash? Yep, negative minus that is 120 and then another negative 30 is great. And then we also

Speaker 1  33:51
just always want to remember that we've got that middle number, which is the the ICF for zero as well. So yes, yes, indeed. We're at $90,000 okay, so let's plug that in there. Great, and keep rolling

Speaker 5  34:12
so 90,000 as your end, cash copied from scaling and cash flows, assets, same thing,

Unknown Speaker  34:24
Okay,

Unknown Speaker  34:25
so loan now becomes 30,000 Okay, okay, so, liability, liabilities 30,000 and equity is 60,000

Speaker 1  34:49
how'd you get that number 90 minus 30? Yes, assets minus liabilities, 90 minus 30, yep. Okay, great.

Speaker 5  34:58
So previous at two. D is 90,000

Unknown Speaker  35:04
Okay,

Unknown Speaker  35:07
earnings negative 10,000

Unknown Speaker  35:16
Okay,

Unknown Speaker  35:17
the distribution is negative 20,000 I,

Unknown Speaker  35:25
one, okay, and let's do a double check.

Speaker 1  35:36
And it is Alan, yeah, so what are the two ways you would check this.

Unknown Speaker  35:41
So making sure that you're,

Unknown Speaker  35:55
I guess I'm, I'm confused with the question,

Speaker 1  36:00
so, so what are the two ways we would double check this is right? So one would be and I think you did. It was assets minus liabilities equals equity. Nine is minus 30 is 60. So you got that, and then what? How could we double check that that was correct? What's the other

Speaker 5  36:16
way? Oh, 90 minus 10 minus 20.

Speaker 1  36:20
There you go, 90 minus 10 is 80. Minus 20 is 60, and lo and behold, it's exact same number. Good job. Thank you. Alonto, well done. Well done. Now I'll just give you, everyone a warning. Every slide that goes by gets a little more difficult, so the sooner that you speak up, the easier it's going to be okay. So, so we're going to now introduce the idea of amortization and depreciation. Okay, so if you remember when we were talking about, when we were talking about cash versus accrual accounting, right? And when we're talking about cash versus accrual accounting, if we take a look at this slide again, remember how we said that if we count, if you count things by cash, it creates this massive roller coaster of up and down, whereas accrual is more looking at like, what's our true position, kind of like over time? Well, if I have a really big expense, like a vehicle or, like a big piece of software or property that I'm buying or a plant or equipment or something like that. Then, if I count that whole amount, if I count, like a $40,000 pickup truck, or a $300,000 piece of, you know, machinery for my farm, or a $2 million factory, or something like that, if, if I were to count that all in the same in the year that I bought it, it would, it would almost have this massive spike, kind of like this, right? And the thing is, is, like, operationally, that pickup truck is helping me for more than just that one year. It's helping me for like, five years, right? Or that software might help me for five years, so to kind of like, penalize the year that I bought it and make the financials really look like it was a horrible year because I had so much money go at the door for this one piece of software, even though there's like, five different years that benefited from that software, would be kind of unfair. So what depreciation and amortization do is, one is for tangible assets, one's for non tangible assets. Is you're allowed to take the expense of that, of that big ticket purchase, and spread it even if you pay for it all, even if you pay for it all in one year, you can spread the expense of it out even. And remember, sales, sold is different than earnings, earned is different than cash collected. So just because cash moves doesn't mean that expenses are also moving. It's two different things, right? So just because I had cash flow go out the door. So right here, this is what's called an amortization table. In year one, I'm gonna have $50,000 cash go at the door to pay for this software, the depreciation, I'm sorry, the amortization table, because software is non tangible, will actually be 10,000 10,000 10,000 10,000 10,000 it'll be spread. It'll be counted over time. It'll be accounted for over time, over the the the expected lifespan of that asset. So this is the first spot where your your cash versus accrual accounting brain is probably going to be a little stretched. And so if anyone has. As a struggle. No problem. It's to be expected. Just let me know. Okay, so who would like to take on the challenge of giving this one a shot? Oh,

Speaker 6  40:09
it's Deborah here. I'll do this only Okay, only because I know it's gonna go way more difficult, and not my forte. So I'll, I'll look like the not so brilliant one in this moment here.

Speaker 1  40:24
I love it. Limit the pain. Limit the pain. I love it. Deborah, okay, so, Deborah, how are we going to fill in this beginning balance

Speaker 6  40:33
sheet? Okay, so we're gonna transfer from the previous one. So ask Yep. Will be 90. Yep, cash will be 90 Yep, liabilities will be 30,000 Yep,

Speaker 1  40:48
sorry, I just need to catch up here. Yep, go

Unknown Speaker  40:51
ahead and the loan will be 30,000

Speaker 1  40:54
great, and assets minus liabilities is 60,000 perfect, $60,000 so far, so good. That wasn't so painful, was

Unknown Speaker  41:04
it? No kidding?

Speaker 1  41:07
Okay, where do so tell us what happened from the little on the side there.

Speaker 6  41:12
Okay, so what I would do is the beginner cash. I'd start off by transferring that so it would be

Speaker 1  41:21
so real quick. Deb Deborah, just Could you read to us what happened in on the left sidebar there the list of things that,

Speaker 6  41:28
okay, sorry. What happened? Of course, the revenue of 250,000 Okay, fences were 150,000 yep, there was a purchase of $50,000 of first software. Yep, it was amortized over five years. Yep, and there was no loan down payment or no pay down, pay down, yeah, there was a distribution to the owner for 30,000 for dividends.

Speaker 1  41:57
Thank you. Perfect. Okay, now, how would you approach this? Go ahead,

Speaker 6  42:04
okay, income statement. I would transfer the revenue of 250,000 into that box.

Speaker 1  42:09
Okay, let me just so revenue of $250,000 and can I just also say to everyone, if I copy and paste from somewhere, it doesn't mean that that's necessarily where that number comes from. I'm just like on my keyboard. It's the fastest thing to do. So this is not, this is not revenue. Even though I copied that square, that's not revenue, it was just the closest possible numbers for me to copy and paste. Okay, perfect. Deborah. Keep going. $250,000

Unknown Speaker  42:36
revenue. The expenses were 150,000

Speaker 1  42:42
and inside of that, just so everyone knows. Just so everyone knows, inside of that $150 all $1,000 already included is the first $10,000 of depreciation, I'm sorry, of amortization. So if you So, if you look at this amortization table to the right, you can see that our cash flow, we had $50,000 go at the door, but we're only counting $10,000 because it's straight line depreciation over five years of $50,000 so our depreciation expense for this year is $10,000 and so in This $150,000 expenses is included $10,000 of expense for that software already Is that making sense makes sense. Taking sense so far, so good. Okay, all right, so obviously, we've got 250 minus 150 gives us earnings of 100 Awesome. Okay, what's next? Deborah,

Speaker 6  43:39
would transfer those earnings on to the statement of cash flows under OCF.

Speaker 1  43:45
Okay, so $100,000 Yeah, got it. What's

Speaker 6  43:49
next? The Beginners cash from the statement of cash flows is transferred from the previous balance sheet. So that would be 90,000

Speaker 1  43:57
on the top. Yes, indeed. Okay.

Speaker 6  44:01
So okay, this is where I got a little confused. So the investment, the ICF, yep, am I putting the full 50 in there or just the 10? So you said expenses included the 10 out of it. So that's where I was like, Okay, I'm getting a little confused here.

Speaker 1  44:20
Yeah. So statement of cash flows is not revenue and expenses, right? That's income statement. All we're asking ourselves with the statement of cash flows is what cash came into the business or left the business. So if you ask yourself, how much cash left the business in this year for that for purposes of investing, so this is the software, how much cash left the business? 50,000 bingo. There you go. So this is our for, like I said, this is our first moment where in our brains, we need to split cash moving and incomes and expenses, because we only counted $10,000 in our expenses over here, even though we had. $50,000 leave the bank.

Unknown Speaker  45:07
Are we okay with that? Yeah,

Speaker 4  45:09
but because we depreciated 10, isn't it going to be minus 40?

Unknown Speaker  45:14
When you say it's going to be minus 40, what do you mean?

Unknown Speaker  45:17
It the the ICF.

Speaker 1  45:22
So if we ask ourselves how much cash I'm loving this moment, you guys, I'm loving if you feel a gear slammed in your head and you're like, This doesn't make sense, you are exactly in the right place. Okay, so Chris, thank you for speaking up. If we strictly ask ourselves the question, how much cash left the bank this year for ICF, how much cash left the bank? 50.

Unknown Speaker  45:52
That's the right answer. Then it says 50 only,

Speaker 4  45:55
yeah, but then you but then what about the 10% the 10,000 you're claiming expenses too looks like you're doubling up.

Speaker 1  46:05
So I'm gonna give you a little sneak preview here. Okay, Chris, so we so included in expenses for this year is $10,000 included in the next year is another $10,000 and we're now in year two here. We have no money going out the door for ICF. Look at the next year. We have another $10,000 on expenses, and we have zero for ICF. So at the end of five years, it will end up at the exact same place we're in year four now we're going to end up in year five. At the end of year five, there's no more cash. There hasn't been any cash flow for years going up for ICF and the the depreciation expense, which is over here on the income statement, is finally completed, and it's caught up,

Unknown Speaker  47:06
I hear your brain processing, and that's perfect.

Speaker 1  47:13
So if I'm looking so if i Chris, if I were to ask myself, let's say I were to buy a house, and if I were to say, what is, was it a good investment or a bad investment? And, and let's say that that house was $100,000 it's probably pretty inexpensive host these days, but just for easy figuring, in fact, let me, let me pull just so that we're not confusing things. Let me just draw this.

Speaker 4  47:49
Can I tell you real fast, though, how I see it, why I say it that way? I'll think it that way. Um,

Speaker 1  47:55
could I go first? Sure. Okay, so if I've got a host a rental property, it's $100,000 and let's say that I make money on it, and let's say I make $1,000 so this is how much invested in year one, and I made $1,000 would you say that it's a good investment that I had $100,000 Leave my bank and I only get $1,000 back if we went, if nothing else happened, I couldn't sell the house. Nothing else would you do a deal where you give 100,000 but only get 1000 back? No, horrible deal, right? So why do we do that deal? We do that deal because over time, this asset is going to probably go up in value, right? Plus, so yes, this is the asset value, plus the mortgage that we have on it, right? Is going to get smaller and smaller and smaller over time, right? And now, because we're looking at the lifetime of the asset, we can now properly, we can now properly assess if it was a good decision or not. Now there's one very big difference between a piece of real estate, because pretty much a piece of real estate is always going to be worth something. It's got some intrinsic value, right? Whereas a pickup truck one day, it's just not worth anything anymore and it's gone, it would be like if this house just one day, poof just disappeared, and the land was gone and you couldn't have it anymore, right? Same with the software. Software is only good for so many years before poof, it's irrelevant, because real estate never has that expiration it. We don't have to think about it the same way. However, we still do need to think about the investment value and is it a good investment over time. And so that's why we spread this out. That's why we spread out. The purchase through depreciation over time. Because otherwise, man, we would have negative $50,000 in this one year if we were to expense it instead of depreciate it, if we put all $50,000 in expenses, all 150 we would look at the earnings for that year we go, that was a shitty year. That was a failure. Fire the CEO. But the thing is, is he wasn't making or she wasn't making a decision for just one year, our CEO was making a decision for the next five years. So to be fair, because it's an asset that's going to be relevant and valuable for the next five years. We need to be fair to the decision and spread that expense out through something called depreciation over the expected lifespan of that asset, which in this case is five years. So that's why we're saying, even though the cash is leaving the bank right here and we're and we're and we're counting it. We haven't swept it under the rug. It's fully accounted for. We're going to spread this out over this year and this year and this year and five total years, so that it's fair in terms of saying, was that a good decision or a bad decision? So Chris, that's how I see it. How do you if

Speaker 4  51:20
I'm comfortable with everything you said. The only bit that, I guess is, is that I'm wrestling with, I'm fine with you, with how we'd appreciate and everything is we've got 50,000 as the investment. Okay, we did spend that, but then in expenses, we've also said we're going to depreciate at 10. So if we so, if we got 50 and but it's a, but it's a, it's a positive 50. I'm loving this. I thought it would be minus 40 on the investment, and then, because you've already allocated essentially minus 10,000 on the expenses. So then 50,000 show up in the statement of cash flows, because you're allocating 40.

Speaker 1  52:10
Yep. Okay, so I think, I think I heard you're saying. So first of all, we kind of stopped midstream. So first of all, you're absolutely right. This is negative. It's not positive. This is absolutely negative, because we have money leaving the business, and we and we can all agree that anytime money is leaving the business, it's negative. So maybe I just jumped the gun a little bit there in wanting to answer your question. So absolutely yes, Chris and to anybody else who was thinking it, because we bought $50,000 of software, you can see what I'm highlighting here, and $50,000 left the business. It's absolutely a negative number. No question about that. Okay, so there's a couple different ways this can be recorded. And so Chris, you definitely picked up on it quickly. This could be counted as I believe it's it's negative. So negative 50 left the business. No question about that. And 10,000 Yes. So this is, this is correct as we're seeing it right now, because the money left the business. Now you're going to see there's two ways that we can handle this. One, we could just say it's negative 40, because in this 100, we've already counted the 10 here, and it's so then it shows up in OCF. And if I'm talking way ahead of everyone else, and it's just Chris and I in this conversation, I'm okay with that. This is either going to be, if we've got it's going to be either, uh, 90 here and 50 here, or it's going to be 100 here and 40. But either way,

Speaker 4  53:52
that's fine, exactly, either it is 10 there,

Speaker 1  53:56
yep, because you've already taken Yes, and we're mid example in the moment. And so yes, this can be either 90 and 50 or can be 140 but either way, we end up with the same net. So, and I'm sorry, Deborah, that we've kind of broken your flow here in terms of what you were doing. But to Chris's point, we've already counted $10,000 of the 50 here, and because it's in the the expenses here, it's going to affect the earnings here. And because it's affected the earnings here, it's going to come over here, and it's going to affect us here. So I'm going to say minus 40. Let's do it that way. And you're going to see in a future slide that there's actually a way to adjust for that. It's it's an adjusting entry. I'm getting a little technical here, and it's adjusting entry to make up for that gap that you're pointing to. But for now, let's just do it that way. Because. Yes, everyone is on the same page. I think everyone's on the same page. Are we all on the same page? As to why this is minus 40 here? Yep. So, Chris tech, Chris, technically this is wrong, like, according to an according to an accountant, according to an accountant, this would actually be 50 and this would be 90. And the reason why?

Speaker 4  55:23
Yeah, no, I'm okay with that. Are you okay with that being 50? Yeah, but I'm not. I wasn't okay with that being 40 and that being 100 okay? Yes, we're depreciating 60,000

Speaker 1  55:35
Yes, 100% so, so let's do it the accounting correct way. Then, which is 90 here and 50 here. And the reason that this this number is now different than that number is, and I was going to introduce it in a cut you'll see here that we have adjusting. It's actually towards the sorry, it's on my key. It's not on the student version, but it's on my key. We have to adjust for non cash expenses. I'm sorry, I'm scrolling all over the place here. So is this, this $10,000 let's, let's go to a future year. So it's really, really clear, if we have a $10,000 expense and we're here on the amortization table. No cash is actually left. So we, so we, even though we have an expense there, we have to kind of like, put the money back. We have to, like, put the numbers back, because we want it to show truly how much cash actually left the business. So an accountant, and you guys don't need to know how to do all of this, as long as you understand the flow your accountant can support with correct you know, adjusting the numbers, this number, whatever it ends up being, is going to be $10,000 lower than the actual cash situation, because we had this non cash expense right here. So it actually gets as we pull it over, we put the $10,000 back, and then that becomes the true OCF of how much cash actually came or went in that year. I'm really nervous. I've lost everyone. This is the first time I've taught this without seeing the whites of every person's eyes. And usually I can look out at the audience and see if we're good, if we're bad. Can I maybe get a show of what's easiest? Maybe a show of hands of let me just change my view here. Unfortunately, I can't. Okay, in the chat box, can you please put got it or confused? One of the two got it or confused. Peter got it, Brandon, Deb got it. Chris got it. Deb sort of got it. Got it good, yeah. Lauren, poking fun at Chris, you're horrible. Okay, we've got a sort of got it. And Deborah says, Okay. Quinn, yeah. What's that?

Speaker 3  58:02
So right now, if you're using ICF as minus 50, shouldn't the OCF be 110 because you take you should be adding back that 10,000 Why are you subtracting it, making it 90 for the OCF?

Speaker 1  58:14
Oh, you're quite possibly right. Let me just double check, because earnings, let me just do this. In my head, earnings should be higher than yes, it's non cash. Yep, you're right. It's 110 My apologies. Thank you. Thank you for catching me. That's

Speaker 3  58:32
why I was confused. But now, okay, I'm okay. Now,

Speaker 1  58:36
yes, yeah, Debbie was on the last training I did, and I completely put the wrong number. I put a negative when it should be a positive, it's through the whole cash flow. Forecast off. So Debbie, see me make mistakes more than once. Okay, so Jim's sort of got it, Deborah's sort of got it. Deborah, where are you?

Speaker 6  58:57
Okay? So revenue, 250,000 Yes. I 150 it includes the depreciation, yeah, which really, I mean, that's just kind of you still have the money in your pocket. That's why I'm still thinking it's the from an accounting of what Revenue Canada or IRS or the tax government agency allows the depreciation, but in essence, you really have the cash in your pocket in that moment. So that's why I'm thinking that the earnings is still 100 or it's, um, it's not 90. It would be 110 it would be one up, right? It would be 110 that makes more sense to me.

Speaker 1  59:45
So the cash is actually not in our pocket because we've, we've, over the course of this year, we spent the 50, right, right? Yeah, so that 50 is gone, gone, gone, even though we're only depreciating for this year, 1010, 1000 of the 50,000

Speaker 6  1:00:00
Okay, so if under the statement of cash flows, the beginning cash would be 90, the OP, the OCF, would be 110, correct, yep, minus the 50,000 and then the loan is 30,000 that's what's left over, correct?

Speaker 1  1:00:21
Well, so before we go into FCF, Deborah, would it be okay if we just clear up this whole ICF situation? Sure. Yeah, yep. Okay. And Deborah, are you good on the ICF situation? Yeah, I am Excellent. Okay, so then there was Jim. Jim was also feeling a little bit like he sort of got it. So Jim, let's get you on the line here.

Speaker 7  1:00:43
Yeah, I guess I'm just still looking at when you say, include the 10,000 depreciation. If we took that out, we had revenue, expenses, we'd have $100,000 in earnings, then depreciation. I guess I'm getting a little confused why we're adding 10,000 to the earnings with that depreciation. I thought that would make it 90,000 not 110,000 so maybe, if you can clear that up a bit

Speaker 1  1:01:10
perfect question, and thank you, every single one of you for your questions. Because you know what, if you didn't care about your business and you didn't care about growing as an individual, you wouldn't have you wouldn't be frustrated right now. So thank you to every single one of you, and you know, thank you for your passion, also in asking for help, you know, and by all means, push me as an instructor. You know, push me as an instructor. I wouldn't expect anything less than than elite from my teaching and from this course, so, so Jim, let's, let's imagine for a second this software was not, let's say it never happened. Then, then what would our expense number be if there was no if there was 10,000 fewer dollars of expense because the software didn't happen,

Unknown Speaker  1:01:59
what would the expense level? So the expense would be 140,000 then we would have the 160 Well, let's see, we would be at 140,000 in expenses. Okay, I get it now. That's good,

Speaker 1  1:02:13
yes, yep. So our earnings would be 110 and 110 would come straight over here. All right, got it? Cool. Okay, awesome. So, so this, so you'll see, and especially in future years, depreciate. So right here, because it's the year that we made the purchase and money did leave the bank, it is kind of a cash expense, but you'll see in future years, it's definitely a non cash expense. This right here, year 2345, that expense is going to show up every one of those years, but it's a non cash expense, because cash didn't leave the bank in that amount in that year, and that's why we have to do adjustments to bring it back. Okay, so, so there's two different ways to count it in here either way, whether it's 100 and 140 or 110 and negative 50, either way, because we could make an excuse, Chris, that that it is a cash expense in this year, because it's the year that it happened, Just as long as we're not double counting it to your point, which was Your point? You said? Tim, careful now don't double count it, and I'm agreeing with you. So perfect. Okay, so, Deborah, we're now off to the races on FCF. How would you how would you identify FCF?

Speaker 6  1:03:30
Okay, so the loan originally was 50,000 so in the we ended up paying a total of 20,000 on that so the loan on that sheet would be 30,000 is what the balance would be

Speaker 1  1:03:44
sure. So this is our beginning balance sheet for the period we're looking at right,

Speaker 6  1:03:49
and loan down to the loan column on the statement of cash flows.

Speaker 1  1:03:55
So statement of cash flows is, is how much did cash come or come to the business or leave the business because of the loan. This isn't the loan total amount. The loan total amount would be on the balance sheet, because that's the State of the Union. Here's how much loan I've got. And then this is how much of a change there was to the

Unknown Speaker  1:04:16
loan. There was no loan payments would be zero.

Speaker 1  1:04:19
Yeah, you got it, yeah, absolutely right. And Brandon, I did just see your comment, so we'll get to you in just a sec here. And Lauren, I see you've got a hand raised. We'll get to you in a second as well. Okay, so the loan, we've had no money come or leave the business because of the loan, so you're absolutely right about that. Okay?

Speaker 6  1:04:39
And the distribution, minus 30,000

Unknown Speaker  1:04:44
and why minus?

Unknown Speaker  1:04:47
It was money leaving the business

Speaker 1  1:04:49
bingo, you got it minus $30,000 you got it. Okay, great.

Speaker 6  1:04:56
So the total FCF would be minus 30.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:01
Yeah, indeed, yep.

Speaker 6  1:05:07
Keep rolling. Okay, so the end cash would be you take the 90 Yep, plus the 110 Yep, for 200 yep, yep, minus the 50,000

Unknown Speaker  1:05:21
so we're at plus 150 yep,

Speaker 6  1:05:22
yep, and then subtract 30k

Unknown Speaker  1:05:27
Yep, and we're left with,

Unknown Speaker  1:05:29
we are left with 120,000

Unknown Speaker  1:05:32
amazing Yes indeed.

Speaker 6  1:05:38
And we carry that forward to the balance down to the balance sheet. So cash would be 120 Yep, software, so we're now adding that as an asset. It would be the full amount correct, the 50,000 Well, we get confused,

Speaker 1  1:06:00
yep, yep, yep, yep. Okay. So before we go into the ending balance sheet and we add some new learning here, I just want to maybe quickly, just make sure that we've cleaned this up. So okay, so Brandon says, Can you walk us through that last correction? Brandon, did I clean that up? Or do we still need to? Oh, I see your next comment now I think, oh, go ahead. Brandon, yeah,

Speaker 8  1:06:25
it was when you changed it from 90 to 110 and then I was just like, oh, wait, what happened? Because I thought I got it, and then we changed that. And I was like, Wait, maybe I don't get it, but now I really do think I'm understanding it. 50,000 was on the expense side. At 150 it was the 50,000 that 150 and we depreciated that by 10, so we spread it out, and so we add that 10 to the earnings, so that when we depreciate it, we have the right, proper accounting right.

Speaker 1  1:06:54
And I would just change the very last thing since, when we adjust OCF, so that it truly represents the cash that came or left the business, then yes, it would be 110 right here. That's right. Thank you. Yeah. Okay, so Brandon's good. Lauren, can I ask a question when you get a moment? Yes,

Speaker 2  1:07:14
okay, so, because when you taught this before, the earnings always were, what went over into the OCF. I think that's why I'm confused, because I would have done the 100 over there, and then the investment, instead of being 50, would have been 40, because I did that and I got the same number. And so now I'm confused if that was wrong.

Speaker 1  1:07:42
Okay, so, so this sheet hasn't changed since the first time I did the course. However, it could be that the conclusion of how we handle this is different, so we just need to make sure we don't double count it. So it's it comes down to the debate of this $10,000 that's depreciated, is that? Is that an expense or the is this a cash expense or non cash expense? That's the technical answer. So basically, whether you pull, whoops, whether you pull 100 over here, and if you're gonna pull 100 over here, then you need to consider this 10,000 to be gone, in which case this would be only 40, right? And that's if you want it, if you want to do it that way. That's okay, but it's, it's either 110 or negative 50, or it's 100 which is 10,000 lower, and 40, which is 10,000 higher, which balance each other out. Okay, okay, good. Awesome. Alonto, how are you doing? I'm good now. Alan to is good. Okay, who else does someone else have a question going once twice? Okay, so we're all good so far. Yes. Okay, good. Okay, so Deborah lead us again.

Speaker 6  1:09:18
Yeah. So the software, okay, this is where I kind of get confused on the whole depreciation of the value of the software and how well the government views it is worthless after the five years, it could still have value. So would it still be worth a $50,000 value? Are we taking the 10,000 off and making it 40,000

Speaker 1  1:09:43
Great question. So to simplify this example, we're going to assume that we bought this software on January 1, so that just really creates a clean situation, that we've had one full year of utilization of the software by the time we do the ending balance. Sheet. So, so from that perspective, yes, the $50,000 software is now only worth 40

Speaker 6  1:10:07
Okay, that makes sense to me, okay, so then full assets would be 160,000

Unknown Speaker  1:10:19
Okay, good, yep, agreed

Unknown Speaker  1:10:22
the balance on the loan? Well, the loan is 30,000

Speaker 1  1:10:26
Okay, and how much did it change from last last year?

Unknown Speaker  1:10:32
Well, nothing. There was no loan payment,

Unknown Speaker  1:10:34
correct? You got it.

Speaker 6  1:10:39
So what next? And so we're taking assets of 160 minus 30 is equity is 130,000 so the previous equity is 90,000

Speaker 1  1:10:58
is that right? Our previous equity

Speaker 6  1:11:03
on the sheet would be 60. No. Well you would do, what was it you the way you got the equity from the last sheet was 90 minus the 10 minus the 20, which was 60,000 Oh, so, pardon me, that's right, 60,000 on that from the previous sheet, when we're looking at the total thing, okay, from so 130 is the total equity. The previous equity on the previous sheet was 60. The earnings would be, where are we? Here? 110 would you that make the OCF?

Speaker 1  1:11:44
So, so great question, really, that's a very bright question. And so in this case, we can just take this number exactly, just exactly what we're seeing right here.

Speaker 6  1:11:53
Okay, the 100, okay, yeah, distribution was 30,000

Unknown Speaker  1:12:02
just distribution was 30,000 and how do we know that?

Speaker 6  1:12:07
Well, from we are talking about above on the statement of cash flows for money leaving the business, yep, right there, yep. And of course, what the owner took out for dividends

Speaker 1  1:12:20
that yes, yeah, exactly the description at the top there, yeah, exactly. Okay. So wow, we've had a wild buck and Bronco override on this one. Let's see if it all works out. Let's double check our work. So Debra, what are the two ways we can double check this work?

Speaker 6  1:12:35
Assets minus liabilities equals equity. So 160 minus 30,000 equals 130,000

Speaker 1  1:12:44
Okay, and then what's the other way we can check it.

Speaker 6  1:12:47
Previous equity which was 60 plus earnings which was 100 so that's 160 and then the distribution which was 30, which would be a minus, correct?

Speaker 1  1:12:58
Ah, yes. We caught an error. Yes, error. An error by me I'd put 30, when, in fact, it should be negative 30. There we go, yeah. And so then we add these three numbers together. I think that's where you had to write. Deborah is 60. 30,060 plus 100 is 160. Minus 30 is 130 I almost, I almost made a mistake there, because I put 30. But that's why we've got the double check, is to catch ourselves, right? And so the equity of the company, not of you, the owner, but you, I'm sorry, not use the owner, but, but the business itself. It's equity. It's overall net worth went down by $30,000 because $30,000 was sent off to the owner. That's why that's a negative number. We had $100,000 of equity come in, new equity of $100,000 from our earnings, which is right here, and then our previous equity is, what the State of the Union, what our net worth of the business was, prior to the year, was 60 which is up here, and that makes sense, that our company equity is now $130,000 okay, all right, in 60 seconds, we're going to take a break. I just want to quickly check in. How is everybody doing? Are people's brains fried at this point, are we okay? Is it like Tim, you're carrying us, it's okay, or is it like Tim? This is nowhere near what I was expecting. Get me the hell out of here and give me my

Speaker 6  1:14:32
money back. I have to say something here, because this is wild. Mouth has not been my forte. This is interesting. Really, really interesting. Thank you for that.

Speaker 1  1:14:40
And what do you mean by that, as in, it's working out for you, or

Speaker 6  1:14:45
it's working out, and it makes a lot more sense now in terms of understanding all these different terms investors and, you know, FCF and ICF and OCF. And I'm like, Okay, this totally makes sense. I can see a pattern here with the. Sheets. This exercise is invaluable,

Speaker 1  1:15:02
so thank you. Yeah, I think, I think financials is more of a logic game than actually a numbers game, believe it or not. And okay, Quinn, go ahead,

Speaker 3  1:15:12
just one feedback on the statement of cash flows for the OCF. Just add another line right down there for adjusting for depreciation, and it will be fine.

Speaker 1  1:15:23
That is a, that is a really hella good idea. Quinn, oh, my God, that's a really good idea.

Speaker 3  1:15:28
Just like you're doing it for the next page, right? The next page, you have earnings and an adjustment for depreciation on the next page, so that would clear up a lot of this confusion.

Speaker 1  1:15:37
Oh, um, yeah, right here, yeah, I've got adjusting for depreciation. Yeah, if I just did the exact same thing. I mean, you know, this is a sign some days I'm just not that bright myself. I had the idea and I couldn't go eight and a half inches to the north and put it in here. Holy, you guys. Are you sure you want to keep learning from me?

Speaker 3  1:15:55
That means you're human. The rest of us is human. So this is good.

Speaker 6  1:16:00
And just as a side note, on the income statement to the left, where you've got expenses, and then, including the 10,000 depreciation, you can add an extra line in there to go under earnings 100,000 like plus, plus line depreciation there too, so that it's Easy to carry over and make sense there.

Speaker 1  1:16:20
Yep, yep, great. And you can say I'm making notes for myself right now so that when I review my want to do my post course debrief, I'll know how to make things easier to understand. Good. Okay. Other feedback, Deborah, I see you're kind of like hanging back a little bit. How you doing? How's it going? Deb

Speaker 1  1:16:46
me, you're trying to hurt, right? Yes, oh, I'm sorry, yeah, not other. Deborah, I meant Deb Jaeger, yeah.

Speaker 9  1:16:51
Step out. We had a coaching call that I had to grab. So can I okay again, please, for Am I gonna have access to it after the training or after

Speaker 1  1:17:01
Yes, yes. In fact, my goal as long as zoom downloads it fast enough, because it is a lot of files, I think within an hour or two, it should be ready. So like tonight, tonight, you should be able to watch it. You too. Quinn, before we hit the morning.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:14
Okay, good, because I'm lost. I'll catch her up.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:17
Okay, okay.

Speaker 4  1:17:19
Where will we access the team in the membership portal, or

Speaker 1  1:17:24
I'm gonna grab the Zoom links, and then I'll probably just email them to everybody. Oh, I see. Okay, yeah, okay, good, okay, how can I please get a check Deb? Jaeger, you're good, yeah, okay, good. I'm so sorry. I'm saying Deb, and there's multiple Debs. Goodness gracious. Okay, anybody else? How are we doing? How are we doing? Peter Lee, good. Jason is fatigued, but loving this stuff. Amortization is new to me. Yeah, yep, yep, yep. I know that feeling. Jim, I need more. These are the things I came for. Good. Jim, that's it's good to hear. Pablo, excellent, course so far, even if it's not 100% crystal clear, I'll practice. Okay, that's it. That's a nice approach. Lauren, could we do a Google sheet with the links, sure, little bit of a fog brain, instead of email? So, Lauren, do you want me to email you with the Google Sheet link or the Google doc link with all the is that what you're saying? Oh,

Speaker 2  1:18:20
I was just being a mechanic and saying we, we could have a Google sheet that lives, and then you just put the links from the dates in that one sheet instead of sending multiple emails.

Speaker 1  1:18:30
Oh, I see you're saying, so it's kind of like a home for all three days. Okay, sure, let's do that. That sounds great. Peter, could you make a note that at the end of the day I need to get all zoom links and put them onto a G doc and email it out. Perfect. Thank you. Okay, good. All right, so we're going to take a 10 minute break. We're going to come back at 5:20pm and we're going to go hard in the last 40 minutes get as far as we can, because the further we get today, the more fun stuff that we can get into, like actually helping your business on day three. So our performance in day one day two, big time affects how much I can help you on day three, see you back in 10 minutes at 520 you.
