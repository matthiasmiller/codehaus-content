Speaker 1  00:02
All right, I'm back so so in the minute that we're waiting here before our official start time, Quinn had a great question, how would bloat factor apply to our personal finance? Well, any ideas? Does anybody have any ideas of how we could apply the idea of expense management and bloat to our personal finance?

Speaker 2  00:30
So if, if I had a job, and I, let's say, I make $50 per hour on the job, then if I save like, 200 a month on my expenses, then that means I won't have to work four hours. Actually. No, I want to work eight hours, one minus the tax factor in there, but, but I can definitely work less if I could save that money already. But I don't see a like a that number, like the blow factor, has to do with profit margin,

Speaker 1  00:59
right? So how could you figure out, in a sense, like your own profit margin per month, as as an individual, person who is, you know, if we're just think about an employee, I don't mean to say just but someone who's an employee, not thinking about a business, how can then,

Speaker 2  01:19
that would be just after tax. So if my tax ratio, if my tax bracket is, let's say, 30% then, then my blow factor would be one divided by point three. I don't know one one divided by point seven, because that's my net income, but that would be like one point something, right? So then that would be my bloat factor.

Speaker 1  01:42
So let's, let's look at it this way. And everybody who just popped in, Quinn, I popped in a minute early, and Quinn had a question. So that's just what we're doing. The question Quinn had was, if I am looking at my, if someone's an employee, does the idea of managing expenses and bloat factor still apply? That's the question that's on the table. So let's look at this the exact same way. I'm going to share my screen here in three, two and one. So this is the three, two and one. There we go. So this is the Bloat calculator. If all I did is say, What is my personal revenue? So an employee's personal income, what? And then, basically, how much money have I kept? How much have I saved from that year, after all my household expenses, my discretionary expenses, my household expenses, are going to be more so like my fixed expenses, right? Like mortgage payment, car payment, average gas expense each month, average food expense each month. That's going to be my fixed expenses, or my overhead of my family and my house. Then the variable might be the entertainment, vacations, just other discretionary spending that I might make. And that's going to leave me with a personal net income or a family net income. And so let's say that at the end of the year of the 100 that I spent, I was able to keep $10,000 and put it to the side as savings. You might say that that's my 10% profit margin, right? And if I've got a 10% profit margin, that means there's a bloat factor of 10. So that means that any expense that I can cut in my family means I don't have to go and make 10 times that amount of money in my day job.

Speaker 2  03:31
Okay, wait, I'm sorry. I'm confused. I thought profit margin is only the expenses for that is only the variable expense, not the fixed

Unknown Speaker  03:41
our overall profit,

Speaker 1  03:44
our overall profit margin is all revenue minus all expenses, including overhead, including variable costs, including taxes, interest, everything this is now that we have in this class the sophistication to Say it this profit is net profit. That's bottom line. Net Profit,

Unknown Speaker  04:03
okay, yeah, yep.

Speaker 1  04:07
Now I would as as a family, as a family, so share my let me just share this again, everything I'm talking about here applies directly to personal finance, directly to personal finance. Sometimes the words are a little bit different, like we talked about, but everything I'm talking about here is personal finance. It also applies there too. No question about it. Let me just quickly see here, if I can see if that'll pick that up. Nope, it's not picking it up.

Unknown Speaker  04:51
Okay?

Speaker 1  04:57
Jason, Jason, Jason, Jason. Hang tight. Hang tight. Okay, hang tight. Quinn, when we talk about personal finance, if we were to look at our family made this much money, we had this much expense, we have this much earnings, then from there it would come our statement of cash flow. So our family had, let's say, $10,000 in savings over the course of the year, we decided to invest $10,000 right? And so it went into a mutual fund, or went somewhere else that actually is an FCF investment. And so let's not confuse investing in the stock market or investing in a mutual fund or 401, K or something like that. It's not an expense, okay? We have a revenue. We have an income. We have household expenses and discretionary spending. We have cash, like extra cash, that we produce through the year. That cash is over here in OCF, some of it we decided to put into, you know, buying some mutual funds, right? And that, therefore, I've got beginning cash at the start of the year for the family and cash for the family. And how, here's our new net worth statement. It's all the same principles,

Speaker 2  06:17
okay, just that, yeah, so this part I get is just that the Bloat factor, I didn't know how to calculate that if it was a personal finance situation,

Speaker 1  06:26
yep. And now you know, just make sure that you're categorizing the right things expenses. I would not categorize investing in the stock market as an expense. I wouldn't categorize investing in a 401, k as an expense, okay, just make sure that you've got that distinction in your mind, and you'll be able to accurately get your theoretical family profit margin. And now that you've got a family profit margin for the year, now you can bring that over to bloat, and now you know what the multiplier is.

Unknown Speaker  07:02
Got it? Okay? Thank you.

Speaker 1  07:04
Yep, awesome. Most welcome, Jason, you had a question, and I'm asking you while you're blowing your nose, I'm sorry, go ahead. So what I was saying is, for me, it's always been helpful to think in terms of as an entrepreneur and looking at my personal finances or how I invest my time or money, is that my time is worth whatever the entire gross revenue of the company is divided by a roughly a 40 hour work week, like 2080 for the year. And so that that would be, that would be your revenue per hour, yeah, but, but that's not your personal income per hour, because we needed to take out all the expenses and get down to your net income. And your net income divided by the number of hours that you've worked, right net your net income plus whatever you paid yourself over the course of the year that would be your per hour. Call it equity, or reward, like total total compensation, owner advantage that you would get from each hour worked. And this is the terrifying and depressing thing for a lot of entrepreneurs, especially in the beginning of something, the beginning of a business, the beginning of a business, the beginning of a campaign, the beginning of a product is we pour in 16 hour days every single day, seven days a week, and we've got like $5,000 of net income at the end of the month. And this is the risk that entrepreneurs take, is we're is, is a we're driven by passion. So it's not maybe just about the reward. We are, in fact, taking the risk, though, that it doesn't work out, and we could have been making 18 bucks an hour at Starbucks, when, in fact, we're making $1.85 in our own business per hour. And what's in our brain is, or at least the theory behind what makes it worth it is one point down the road, there's going to be some point down the road where I'm going to have enough leverage in this business from systems I've set up, people that I've hired, projects that I've launched, that I am now able to show up lead a team, spend maybe 40 hours leading this team, and that's going to trigger 6000 hours a week of work by people and robots and computer programs. And that's going to then deliver $3 million in revenue to the company, which, after I pay for all the robots and people and things, is going to lead to $300,000 in net income for me working 40 hours a week, right? And then the next year after that, hopefully it's 400,000 and then 500,000 and then a million, right? And that's the game we're playing the the the question of the challenge is, are you. Willing to work for whatever it is, $1.85 an hour in the beginning, with the idea that somewhere down the road you're going to be making $1,000 an hour, $5,000 an hour, even $500 an hour, right? So now the good news is, even if we have a business fail, we haven't lost the experience, and we haven't lost the skills along the way, we just may need to regroup and redeploy to a new business, a new opportunity, or maybe join forces with someone else, and that's where we're going to get our big payback, big payday and and enjoy the freedom of working for ourselves and whatnot. Does that help? Jason? Awesome, kind of challenging if you optimize for maximum revenue, and you're not thinking about what you actually get to keep because you'll generate maximum revenue, but you may end up hiring a bunch of people or make a bunch of expenses that end up sucking every bit of reward out of it for you personally. So keep an eye on that. Okay, who is our next courageous, intrepid entrepreneur who's going to throw their hat in the ring for the next stage of diamond financials. Was that? Peter, yeah, have you gone yet? No, okay, Peter, take us to the Promised Land, my friend. All right, no pressure.

Speaker 3  11:27
So for the balance sheet, we'll just transfer everything over. So assets will be 390,000

Unknown Speaker  11:38
Okay, 390

Unknown Speaker  11:42
cash is 350

Speaker 3  11:49
okay, then software is 20,000 and I'm

Speaker 1  11:54
not double checking in your numbers. I'm taking you 100% at word, at face value here,

Unknown Speaker  12:00
and then Tories at 20,000 as well.

Speaker 1  12:07
Okay, and if we double check that 350 plus 20 is 70, is 390 just FYI for everyone, when you start looking at real balance sheets, there's a lot of items sometimes. And so you can always double check that total assets by just summing up what's below it. Okay. Keep below it. Okay,

Speaker 3  12:25
keep going. Pete, so then we have a loan for 20,000 so liability will be 20,000 Okay, and the equity is 370,000 okay.

Speaker 1  12:45
Okay, so let's keep rolling.

Speaker 3  12:48
Yeah, what happened was, there's a revenue of 650,000 overhead of 540,000 and we paid 40,000 in dividends, okay? And there's year for depreciation of that software for 10,000 Yep, we also pay off a $20,000 loan. And then, yes, no 2000 shirts at $20 retail, which is $5 each cost of goods sold.

Speaker 1  13:23
There we go. And that's exactly what we were looking at on the previous slide. I said, remember, we bought those we bought those shirts, 2000 of them, right? And we paid $10,000 for the shirts. No, I'm sorry. We paid $20,000 for the shirts. That's the inventory right here, and we got 400 shirts for the $20,000 right? So that means $5 a piece. And so therefore we have $5 each cost of goods sold, right there. Now we're saying that our expense is $5 each cost of goods sold, and our retail price of what we're selling is $20 right? So if we, if we take a look at a very, very little mini version of an income statement, we've got the shirt, we've got revenue of $20

Unknown Speaker  14:15
we've got cogs

Speaker 1  14:19
of $5 so we have a shirt is $20 Usher COGS is $5 that means our gross profit on that one shirt is $15 there's no overhead on a shirt, but there is an overhead on a business that sells shirts. So, you know, obviously, then we would have overhead after that, and if we're selling 2000 shirts at $20 retail, then that means p how much? How much revenue would that be for 20 shirts? 40,000 Okay, so two times two is for $40,000 in revenue. Okay, perfect. So that's our revenue. What's our cost of goods sold on that 10,000 exactly, it's the same $5 cogs times 2000 shirts. Is $10,000 is our cogs. Okay? So just on the shirts themselves, What would our gross profit be

Unknown Speaker  15:21
30,000 and

Unknown Speaker  15:23
how'd you get that number?

Speaker 3  15:24
Cost revenue minus cost of goods sold? Here

Speaker 1  15:28
we go. You got it 10 out of 10. So there we go. 30 grand would be a gross profit. Okay, great. Let's get that scratch pad out of the way, and let's now start filling this in on the income statement.

Speaker 3  15:40
Cool. So the revenue is going to be 650,000

Unknown Speaker  15:47
our revenue is 650,000 Okay, yep, and we know that from up here.

Unknown Speaker  15:55
And then the gross profits going to be 640,000 because we minus, okay,

Speaker 1  16:04
right? So in our revenue is included $40,000 of shirt sales, which is what we said here. We had shirts here, right? That's $40,000 of shirt sales. So part of our 615 revenue is $40,000 of shirt sales, right? So that's where we've got 650 in revenue, 40,000 insurance sales. If we've got 40,000 in shirt sales, then that means that we're also going to have $10,000 of cogs. And so Pete is saying 650 in revenue, minus our 10,000 in cost of goods sold to to send the shirts out the door. Leads us to what was the number you said, Pete, 650 so 650 is revenue, and then our gross profit is what? Oh, sorry, 640 you got it, yep.

Unknown Speaker  16:57
And then overhead expenses is 540,000 I Yep.

Unknown Speaker  17:11
Okay,

Unknown Speaker  17:16
so then earnings is 110,000

Unknown Speaker  17:26
earnings is so you said 110,000 What had you say? 110,000

Speaker 3  17:37
so what revenue at the top there? So 650 minus the overhead expenses,

Speaker 1  17:46
yep, get the shirt sales. So if you remember, if you remember from our drawing, I'll do some different color mark, sorry I didn't let you in a little quicker there. Sorry about that. I got in the zone here. So if we remembered, we said we have we've got revenue minus cogs equals gross profit minus overhead. And in our drawing, we also had, like, interest, taxes, whatever. We're just going to simplify it so we just say gross profit minus overhead equals net profit. So if we keep that in mind,

Speaker 1  18:45
and we go side by side. Here we've got revenue of 650 Oops.

Speaker 1  18:56
There we go. Keep that in mind. We've got revenue of 650 we subtract cogs, which is the shirt expenses, 10,000 gives us gross profit, which is 640 then 640 gross profit. Then we subtract overhead, which is 540

Unknown Speaker  19:18
we're left with 100,000

Speaker 1  19:21
100,000 There you go. That's the number, yep. So, so, so our quick learning point there is up until now, we've just said revenue minus expenses equals earnings, right? And now that we've got some cogs in here, we're actually splitting our expenses into two different kinds. We've got revenue, we've got direct costs, and we've got overhead costs. So it's it's not just 650 minus overhead of 540 it's not 650 50 minus 540 gives us 110 it's 650. Minus 10 gives us 646. 40 minus 540 gives us 100 Good, good, good. If yes, thumbs up. Yeah. Goldie, how you doing? Cool? She might be frozen. I'm gonna assume she's doing great. Okay, so let's keep it going. Pete,

Speaker 3  20:28
so we're gonna move the earnings from the income statement to the statement of cash flows. In cash flow, thank you. And then we're gonna adjust $10,000 positive for depreciation.

Unknown Speaker  20:43
And why positive and not negative?

Speaker 3  20:48
Because we counted that cash going out in a previous year, and now we're adjusting it. Yeah, now we got to adjust it,

Speaker 1  20:59
right? Yep. So that the term is, the expression is, we have a $10,000 non cash expense, and so we have to adjust when we're going to the cash flow statement. So there's a non cash expense. Sure, we can also have a non cash revenue, by the way, right, which we can talk about later, but it's a non cash expense, so we have to adjust. And so expenses, I'm sorry, earnings right here, it's like they're under reported by $10,000 because we have this non cash expense, they're under in a sense, it's so, believe me, this is the right number. Earnings is the correct number. But when we're talking about OCF, it's like it's under reported by $10,000 because we had an expense that was a non cash expense, so we got to put the money back. We got to put the 10,000 back. And that's why we're saying plus $10,000 there.

Speaker 3  22:02
Okay, keep going. Pete, for the inventory, I'm gonna say it's gonna be a positive 40,000 because we received 40,000 Yeah, this is, I was kind of question about this, yeah, so I'm curious, is that

Speaker 1  22:27
stepping into the mouth of the dragon on this one Pete? So, in essence, we've already counted. We've already counted. Remember, because our we had $40,000 in shirt sales here, and so therefore that's showing up in earnings, and that's already showing up over here in earnings. Okay, okay, so, so the number is not going to be 40, hmm. What we're doing this is adjust for inventory. Adjust for inventory and and if you think about it, we've had,

Unknown Speaker  23:18
we've had

Speaker 1  23:21
our cash has gone up by $10,000 because our inventory. We've reconverted inventory into cash. That's the way to say it Okay, right? And, and it was $10,000 of inventory that get converted back into cash. So the number is $10,000 okay, and our and our cash went up by $10,000 because it's like, let's see if I can make the logic statement that makes the most sense, or is, let's just say, the easiest to understand. So we put back depreciation by $10,000 because we had a non cash expense. And so this was, like, under reported. We don't want inventory to kind of like be double counted, in a sense, because we sold, we sold $40,000 in that 40 is the 10. So we'd be kind of double counting, in a sense. So that's why it's got to be plus 10, and if, and if, for any reason. And I'll even admit, for me, sometimes it's like I have to sit here and do a bunch of mental gymnastics. And usually, if I spend about five minutes, I can usually get to it. And then what I realized is like, you know, if I can get there or whether I can't get there, if I just remember that adjustments for inventory sales is plus $10,000 I know it's a positive or negative. I know that the number is 10,000 already, because. We were converting one asset type to another, from shirt, from shirts to cash, and that just kind of keeps it simple. So that's kind of a practical statement. Now another way to look at it, yeah, go ahead. Laura,

Speaker 4  25:11
Lauren's out of the the meeting, just to let you know she's trying to get back in. She's not

Speaker 5  25:17
able to. I think there's a few people trying to get back in, I don't know. Just didn't want to interrupt. Yeah, sorry, there's only six. People on so I don't know if that's a glitch or something or what.

Unknown Speaker  25:25
Hmm, okay,

Speaker 1  25:27
that's interesting. Yeah, my participants is showing eight, and I have got nobody in the waiting room.

Speaker 4  25:35
Okay, she said she's trying to get in, but she can't.

Speaker 3  25:39
It's weird. I think there's something going on. Yeah, I got, I got kicked out for like two seconds, and then I got back in, like as well, when you're doing that scratch pad thing, hmm.
