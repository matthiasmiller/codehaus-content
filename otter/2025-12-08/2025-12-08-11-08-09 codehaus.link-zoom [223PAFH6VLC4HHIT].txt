Unknown Speaker  00:18
You guys. Oh, alrighty.

Speaker 1  00:28
I'll go ahead and share screen. Do you want? When are you going to work on the import stuff? Do you want the task system updated?

Matthias Miller  00:36
Yeah, I'm Yeah. If you want to kick off an update all it's pretty straightforward For me to kick it off on my end. I

Unknown Speaker  01:04
running start soon. Okay, first

Speaker 1  01:09
of all, for the I was working on, well, Saturday, I was working on the due date stuff, and running into trouble, because we don't lack I wanted to show a drop list of period dates so you could choose any unpaid period date and then say you're going to change the due date. There the product. The problem is that as prompts can't rely list. As prompts can't rely on another s prompt, unless it's like a check box or something. I needed to pass in a numeric ID so that I could look up the contract

Unknown Speaker  01:52
right, remember

Unknown Speaker  01:59
what the exact validation so I don't

Matthias Miller  02:03
know if I like this approach. This will bite us. But couldn't you do a couldn't you create a list, box of string of a hidden list of contract IDs, and make it dependent, but then you have to look at the period. It's gonna look at the periods for all of those that's terrible. Oh, good gracious. Don't do that. Well, we, we can do our fancy inline ask prompts, like we do for weberland and places like that. Leacock, maybe

Speaker 1  02:35
where it's you're saying, it's just essentially ask prompts on the detail screen.

Matthias Miller  02:39
It's like a detailed variable, and then you click a button down, changes, trigger it, fire it off. Yeah, I don't, I don't have anything.

Speaker 1  02:49
Can it still? Can we still just pass it into the next 30? Because that's probably what we want to do,

Matthias Miller  02:54
unless we want it. Yeah, you can have the x 30. You could have the x 30 B. Well, then you have to, you have to trigger a save. So the detail variable field is going to treat it as dirty. You click the button it says you want to save. Yep, save, run it.

Matthias Miller  03:19
Any alternative? Native.

Speaker 1  03:26
I mean, couldn't you theoretically just concat all the contract numeric contract IDs out there into a string, into a list,

Unknown Speaker  03:40
and then do a value on it. A little dumb, but would that work?

Matthias Miller  03:48
It would work, but it's gonna, it's gonna calculate the unpaid, no, no,

Speaker 1  03:59
it wouldn't have to. I does the helper list required relies on that as prompt being set, or will it actually calculate for each one?

Matthias Miller  04:11
Oh, you mean on the detail screen? Do that?

Unknown Speaker  04:15
Wait, wait, no, I was thinking the import. Does it Okay? Run every single possible,

Matthias Miller  04:23
yeah, when you're loading the report, unless, when you're running the import, it would load all the possible ones. I think, Okay, here's another idea. Okay, could we? We could fire off in our 20 with the prompt, and then the arc 20 redirects to an X 30. You can't do it in a fancy pop up window. Uh huh.

Speaker 1  05:01
A nasty are we going to want, are we going to want to be able to easily change due dates from other places? Are we going to say it's always contract detail

Speaker 1  05:20
screen? If it's always contract detail screen, then we can, we can do on changes or something

Matthias Miller  05:30
well, but couldn't you even with on changes? If you had to do it from somewhere else, you could build an X 30 that uses those on changes. That's true. I think the question then becomes, how complicated is it? I mean, what's the relative cost of doing on changes versus x series,

Unknown Speaker  06:01
validation stuff gets nasty.

Speaker 1  06:09
This don't, doesn't have, I guess you could do an error change on the RG row. But if we had next 30 that we can easily do ask for a validation

Matthias Miller  06:21
Well, I mean, but you could, you can have a prompt and hide the on Change button if it's not valid, and just show the message there. So basically, it's like a it's like you have something like a button that pops open a section with the prompts, and if there's empty, if it's if everything's empty, there's no button put it in invalid value, it shows the error message underneath it. If everything's valid, it shows a CONFIRM button, which makes the change.

Unknown Speaker  07:01
That's not terrible trying

Matthias Miller  07:07
to think if we have any other

Unknown Speaker  07:23
and how else would you do it?

Matthias Miller  07:31
Well, yeah, I mean, except for the R 20, I think that these are, yeah, these are the options. I mean, you wouldn't have to you could potentially say.

Matthias Miller  07:56
You could you could potentially consolidate this into something simpler, where you have something like an edit period thing, and you drop the select the period, and then you have a button to Change due date and a button to give fees a uh, but then you need to select exactly which fee you want. Yeah, how much work

Speaker 1  08:32
we are? Is forgiveness gonna run to the same trouble? Probably,

Matthias Miller  08:36
I think so. Yeah, how much work would it be to mock up forgiveness and this that we could show Dwayne before we do an implementation.

Speaker 1  08:55
It shouldn't be too bad it you're thinking something like an edit period button here, which you click and then it has, would it be? Well, I

Matthias Miller  09:14
think it's something like a forgive payment button that pops something open for the for that, and a edit due date that pops something open for that, and then the period, the forgive prompts for period, fee type and Forgiveness amount probably shows the current balance forgiveness amount, and then clicks the button. Maybe the button could run, I mean, and then I think that's the question that is, do you want the button to run the x 30, or do you want it to actually make. The changes and that part really does it even matter that that much from an implementation standpoint,

Unknown Speaker  10:09
What happens? I don't think so.

Speaker 1  10:54
Okay, long term, how do we expect them to be forgiven payments, editing due dates and stuff? Will that always be on the contract record?

Matthias Miller  11:08
Yeah, I mean, I would, I would anticipate that. Okay, it's a relatively rare event, and we basically, I think, said, Look, when taking a payment, that's something that you do independently of that.

Unknown Speaker  11:20
Okay, okay,

Speaker 1  11:23
okay, so I should, we should get something locked up for Dwayne, and then I can, if we get the Go ahead, we can go ahead with it. Yep,

Unknown Speaker  11:38
good. Could create a child task.

Speaker 2  11:40
I or forgive.

Speaker 1  12:03
Okay, awesome. So I've been looking at the calculation stuff a bit again. Our old I report for old eporonian doesn't work because I yanked the period structure stuff. Okay, are we do? Should we try to recreate that so that we can see what the old EPO was? Bit of a pain. Maybe I should. I can also see I might be able to revert it temporarily.

Matthias Miller  12:42
Um, I don't know what's the advantage of the old I

Speaker 1  12:50
think we're just going to compare what we had compared to what it is now. Right?

Speaker 2  12:59
I mean, mean,

Speaker 1  13:03
I think it's this guy. I think I could just pull it back temporarily if we wanted

Matthias Miller  13:13
to make it probably make it easier for I think so.

Speaker 1  13:30
I was also you had wanted some macros like

Speaker 1  13:41
rental fee Balance. Do rental fee upcoming? Balance, things like that. Do?

Unknown Speaker  14:10
How are you okay? What are

Speaker 1  14:22
you expect? Expecting these to handle tax? Like, should these be total?

Unknown Speaker  14:32
There's so many problems. I

Matthias Miller  14:55
would I. I mean, these are helper, helper macros. So I don't know, I don't know

Speaker 1  15:04
you're wanting these be things that anyone could call

Matthias Miller  15:10
they do. So we need to presumably differentiate between tax, taxable versus non tax. We would presumably have taxable and non taxable variants.

Speaker 1  15:19
So you went a rental fee balance due with tax, without tax, essentially being so they get really hard to name because the names get so long, but we can, I can find something

Matthias Miller  15:31
for them. I don't disagree. I just don't know how to predict exactly, exactly. Yeah,

Speaker 1  16:08
okay, and that also I was doing so when we're showing the total here, what I was doing is just ripping through the RG and summing the total rows. Yep, I I'm afraid that's not going to work depending on tax stuff, but maybe we don't care too much at this point, I'm afraid we have to get smart and do sums on the subtotals and then, and then tax based off of remaining subtotal. Essentially, it's like if you would have a rental fee that's incurred at 6% you pay half of it at 6% and then it changes to 7% it's going to look like you have

Matthias Miller  16:59
paid for balance due and for upcoming balance, yeah,

Speaker 1  17:08
what I've been doing, I added a subtotal balance. Enough balance is the right word. The subtotal balance for incurred rows that checks what its balance is compared to. So it's matching on type, period and type, getting the balance from there. I It's subtitle, balance. I think this is the idea we want. It's, I'm afraid it's going to get painful once the RG gets big, if you're essentially ripping through the RG every time. But maybe we probably shouldn't think about that right now and come back to it later.

Matthias Miller  17:49
I think so if it gets slow, we'll add, you know, reluctantly, add caching. Well, I don't know what we'll do. You'll have to be a little careful with with macros and such, but either add an RG, where we catch it on here, and do lookups in there, or just use record totals or something.

Speaker 1  18:12
Yeah, okay, well, I'll use this model then for now and if it, if we run into trouble, then we can deal with it. Then, yep,

Matthias Miller  18:23
I mean, realistically though, hang on, let's say a 48 month contract, times maybe 500 items, pros in the RG.

Matthias Miller  18:41
So for each incurred row, for 50, for 48, of the incurred rows, let's see. Sorry, 60, maybe 60 times five is like 300 so each of the incurred rows, you're ripping through. TRG, 60 times 300 like I said, it's 18,000

Unknown Speaker  19:04
that's not even thinking of like weekly or something.

Matthias Miller  19:09
It's true so, but I still think, or even simpler option is to have a field change. Field change expression that stumps in a hidden field, I don't know. Yeah, or a filler.

Unknown Speaker  19:31
It's good enough for now, yep.

Unknown Speaker  19:37
Okay, this guy.

Speaker 1  19:47
So we had been working on EPO with and without tax, needing to get tax on non tax on taxable fees and stuff Correct. I need to separate them. Here. Are we digging it what? I'm not sure what the best way to move forward is. What are

Matthias Miller  20:14
we? Okay? So this is the, this is the discrepancy we had shown. We're showing a different Okay, do you know the reason for the discrepancy? It's a it's the CRA no unpaid rental fee balance. We thought we had an unpaid rental fee Balance, but we don't anymore

Matthias Miller  21:02
that we have

Speaker 1  21:13
rental feedback. I bet we already did. We already have an EPO or something. Oh, it's tax stuff. Subtitles all paid taxes different. Haha. So this is exactly where we need to be looking at subtitle balance. So I think this one is right a payoff amount to left of $0 is correct.

Matthias Miller  21:46
We're showing the tax taxable amount was showing is unpaid for some reason in the old box, well,

Speaker 1  21:57
oh yes, because we're just looking at total. I think the old logic just looked at the total.

Matthias Miller  22:10
Well, one one looked with tax, and one the other without tax. It looks like contract value with tax, contract rent paid with tax.

Speaker 1  22:20
Like did it? It was, it's this old period stuff where it's substituting through getting the total minus the amount paid. Okay, and the tax rate is different. Apparently. What were they?

Matthias Miller  22:38
No? Show me where?

Speaker 1  22:41
Well, the paid, they paid 27 cents, and it's calculated at 32 cents.

Matthias Miller  22:50
How did we calculate?

Speaker 1  22:52
I'm guessing, I mean, my odds are that in all this tax stuff, something shifted from a 6% to 7% or something, me, mean, let's See subtotal of 454, 54.727

Speaker 1  23:20
28 Yeah, it was a 6% and now it's a 7% so that's why it's probably in the migration shifted somehow. So this is, this is why we need, yeah, it's better, but this is why we need to do subtotal stuff as well. Because right here, this guy, we think the tax and the total should be returning zero, right, correct. If I need to change those macros to look at subtotal balance and then when you calculate tax, it's a pain, but it'll be fine. What do we calculate it off the current rate or off the road? Don't we

Matthias Miller  24:05
have to calculate it off the rows, off the incurred rate? Yeah, you're correct.

Unknown Speaker  24:09
Okay, so that one's good. This one

Unknown Speaker  24:24
paid. This one also, again, this is tag stuff.

Unknown Speaker  24:35
Yeah, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  24:38
I wonder how many of these are good end of

Matthias Miller  24:40
just, could you sum the pay tax difference and include that in your yeah report?

Unknown Speaker  25:00
You want to include in the balance.

Unknown Speaker  25:15
Yeah, first one, just sort this and see

Matthias Miller  25:23
we wouldn't have to. We just eyeball it and see what's it's up to you how you want to handle it.

Speaker 1  25:29
That's really close. This one's off by might be rounding stuff there, probably rounding. That's the same rounding, rounding. Throw it in there so that we can actually see the Real or add another column. I don't care which I

Matthias Miller  26:18
think you need to drop your minus, but it could be wrong. No, okay, great, yeah, okay, so this one,

Unknown Speaker  26:32
I mean, the differences are now fractional.

Matthias Miller  26:38
Do we know, and does it matter where it came from?

Speaker 1  26:42
So, great example, apparently most of it, because last time we looked at this, we still had a lot of big differences, right? Stuff must have been resolved along the way.

Matthias Miller  26:57
Yeah, I agree, but I'm very curious on that first one. Yeah, first one, so I'm trying to use your calculator, not mine. So like, six, six, 6.84, times. One, 771, 33, what tax rate do we Use on this one

Matthias Miller  27:39
7% here? But the the right so the old,

Unknown Speaker  27:49
the paid rose didn't pay tax, it wasn't taxable.

Matthias Miller  27:57
Well, that would do it. So presumably, somebody

Unknown Speaker  28:05
it, I'm sure I

Unknown Speaker  28:09
don't know what happened,

Speaker 1  28:15
or tax, just amount didn't get marked as paid or when, with the import stuff, I don't know. Oh, this is, yeah, this isn't one of the ones you all imported, either. I think this

Matthias Miller  28:27
looks like it was you guys created by

Unknown Speaker  28:29
Jonathan. Jonathan made in the test system.

Matthias Miller  28:32
Okay, so could we? Could we add the created by in the columns?

Unknown Speaker  28:37
Oh, sure. I

Unknown Speaker  29:29
here's the 59 cents from Duane. So

Matthias Miller  29:50
what is so like? Rental balance, 69, 4.08, times, 1.07 i. 6734, that's not coming out the same, 786, 7.6 times, 1.07 8418 33 that's not coming out the same, 14, 61.6 8.0781 52 the tax rate is almost looks like a tax rate change of some kind, but I don't know if that's true. See

Unknown Speaker  30:33
tax difference, that looks fine

Matthias Miller  30:37
when I do 14, 161 68, times 1.07

Unknown Speaker  30:55
What are you getting? This at

Matthias Miller  30:59
15, 152, 99 it's off by 13 cents.

Matthias Miller  31:08
It's because we are summing on the old one. We're summing the monthly taxable amount instead of paying the tax on the total item. And so you get minute differences, right?

Speaker 1  31:26
So, yeah, I mean, don't, don't we effectively, just always, always need to calculate tax at the very end, which is what we're doing now,

Matthias Miller  31:36
what we're doing now, which is right? And that's going to be everything that, okay? So we, I mean,

Speaker 1  31:42
the rest of these are like 10 Cent differences and that that's just going

Matthias Miller  31:46
down, yeah, I think that makes sense. That does make sense to me.

Unknown Speaker  31:54
I'm, I'm pretty happy.

Matthias Miller  31:58
Yeah, that's good. All right, revert it, send it.

Unknown Speaker  32:03
I shouldn't have committed then.

Matthias Miller  32:08
Well, it's fun to I didn't know. Keep people guessing exactly.

Unknown Speaker  32:15
I have been hammering commits like I haven't in a while, which has been fun.

Speaker 1  32:26
John is sick today, so he's he got the imports working. I don't think he's done. I don't know how much he work today, but we have which I need to work on that due date stuff, and we need to. And you figure, if there's anything left with this calculation stuff, well, okay, there are a few of those macros to fill out, but we're down to these guys. Dude, let's go. What did I do? I got distracted by some other stuff too, Saturday, but I did these ones that I had. What? What did I do? I'm in like, Oh, it's on days, not hours. I tried to pick off some of the bigger ish ones at those nine hours, and it took me, like, two. It wasn't any, it was all pretty simple, so, but like, I entry types working, and then some just other niggly little things anyway. So that was fun, and that's cool. I'll probably, I don't know how much of this stuff I'll do, resale, buyback, but the rest of this stuff is so I might throw auto pay one to Nick. That's a fast one, but most of these are just pull on, just dead simple. And I just want Sean to just do it in the next in the week. This week he has time. Yeah. So I think we're honestly basically done. I need Nick needs to finish up his depreciation framework. There's maybe an hour of work there. I need to do due date. That's a big one, so that I'll get him lock up to Dwayne and see what he thinks. But other than that, I think we're getting

Matthias Miller  34:18
really close. Once you have the design for that one, though it's it's it's actually not going to be that bad. No, it's not, but, yeah, but we got to get it nailed down.

Speaker 1  34:28
Wow, it was, I feel like I've had just a few little macro things I've done in the last week, nothing huge, but things like, like this sub total balance that suddenly just unlocked it. Like, ah, this is what we need. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  34:43
It just works, yeah, and, oh, this is just

Speaker 1  34:46
has spent a ton of time on tax stuff in the last, right, two weeks or something. And it's now way I like it a lot. I like the model pretty well, which I think we talked about it something. To get here. We have the paid amounts, we have the calculated and we cash rates on incurred rows. There's macros for all this. It just works. Lisa, is there any place where this is documented, the tax handling this is like the one place where we need to Yeah, I'm not sure how well it is. We really should. And I need to go, I need to yet fix the total macros, right, so that we're that'll take work with that subtotal macro. I don't think it'll be too bad, but it will take some

Matthias Miller  35:38
work. It'll take some work.

Speaker 1  35:42
Oh, I just feel happy because suddenly December is about done.

Matthias Miller  35:48
Well, then let's go like, Oh man, okay. Okay, so, so what else do you need? By the way, the mental clutter is like, I'm this is my personal bias, and maybe it's but I think, I think lack of clarity is one of the greatest obstacles to, yeah, getting things done.

Unknown Speaker  36:19
I think that's quite right.

Matthias Miller  36:25
Okay. Well, what else? What else do we have to I was

Speaker 1  36:33
trying to make some notes for myself here for what we talked about. To do, fix the total macros you calculate basically the tax and total macros to calculate correctly when the rates change. Yep, um.

Speaker 1  37:03
Do we want this tax by tax breakdown? I'm guessing probably yes. I think that's what you all expect. It's just, I'm realizing most places we just talk about we have macros like contract balance with tax and without tax. But then my macros for summing, I have subtotal, tax total,

Unknown Speaker  37:29
oh, oh, I should also create like contract era balance.

Matthias Miller  37:42
That's not right. Contract. What balance

Speaker 1  37:45
CRA and security deposit like do you want to be able to pull what's currently in? Yeah, yep.

Matthias Miller  37:54
I'm not sure why that's not on the main screen. Probably good room with Dwayne, but it seems like that should be front center somewhere, yeah, yeah,

Speaker 1  38:05
which, that's a little different, because most of these balances, it's saying, what do we owe? This is act or are you? When I was saying security deposit balance, I was thinking, how much do we I have in do we I have in my security deposit right now? But should it actually be? How much do we need to pay to secure deposit? But that happens right away.

Matthias Miller  38:30
No, there is no need to pay well. I mean, theoretically in a CRA you could say they put, this is a CRA contract, but I mean that that comes back to initial payment handling, and I don't think there's, I don't want to think about that. I don't think it's relevant to our conversation here. I think it's just what is in there. Okay, I'll add those be simple enough.

Speaker 1  39:05
Okay, and these are going to need to split these into with and without tax. Okay, and then how, what should early payoff amount, Oh, do we need to handle early payoff amount work on the logic to get it to work for when there are non taxable fees. Right now we're going to calculate tax on them.

Matthias Miller  39:33
Yes, we do. We need to differentiate between

Unknown Speaker  39:39
the taxable, non taxable, subtotal, probably,

Matthias Miller  39:43
presumably, I didn't even think about that. We ran into this issue as for with, with the question of, what sales tax Do you incur? Because don't we need to, we need to, we need to. We for, for outstanding fees. We need to add the tax rate as of the time it was incurred,

Speaker 1  40:12
so we can't even calculate what we're currently doing isn't Right then, no, I right?

Matthias Miller  40:24
Because you need to unpaid.

Matthias Miller  41:07
Do we want to represent that? It

Speaker 2  41:19
gets really confusing. We

Matthias Miller  41:32
have the rent paid, unpaid rental bit the balance without tax, the balance or EPO, the CPO amount with without tax. Now what would make the most sense?

Speaker 1  42:01
So our whole model for when we're applying tax is wrong, right? Sorry, what? We just summed all the non, all the all the subtotals and apply one tax rate to it, yeah.

Matthias Miller  42:18
What should happen is, if we're computing with tax, okay, but what about with the CRA?

Matthias Miller  42:34
I'm still very frustrated that I don't understand CRA better. I

Matthias Miller  42:51
easily find a CRA contract in here. CRA

Matthias Miller  43:00
where I'm headed is

Matthias Miller  43:20
we're taking.

Matthias Miller  43:41
Why are we including the EPO subtitle with tax up there? Like 41 37.07 minus 1706 53 equals 2430 54 like is the EPO subtitle with tax even used currently. I

Matthias Miller  44:16
Yes, pay off amount with tax.

Matthias Miller  44:25
A let's go back.

Speaker 1  44:49
We're doing subtle without tax because we can't we can't calculate tax on this guy. Because you're not supposed to calculate it on CRA, right, right.

Matthias Miller  45:19
I think the biggest question is, I think conceivably, the EPO subtitle with tax should be a sum of

Matthias Miller  45:46
basically each of the fee balances, we should have a without tax and a with tax amount. And the EPO said with tax should include the taxable amount and then, and I have no idea How to reasonably represent that.

Unknown Speaker  46:09
So essentially,

Unknown Speaker  46:22
yes, I need to factor

Unknown Speaker  46:36
this later. I'm

Speaker 1  46:47
uh, although these guys are also because my underlying macros are wrong, then these aren't going to work where there's rate changes right now,

Matthias Miller  47:03
we really would be what really would be ideal is only look at remaining balances, times current incurred rate.

Unknown Speaker  47:13
No, oh, sorry, yes.

Matthias Miller  47:19
I mean with the periods incurred rate.

Speaker 1  47:25
I mean, rip through the RG, find incurred rows, get the balance times. Yeah,

Speaker 1  47:40
wish that's isn't that just what my total balance do as of should, is that what it becomes, Wait, isn't that what don't all of these change from ripping through the whole energy to just using that incurred?

Matthias Miller  47:55
Seems like it. Seems like it.

Unknown Speaker  48:00
I think that'll help.

Unknown Speaker  48:17
This is really, this is just completely changing my

Speaker 1  48:33
my whole structure is just different. Is in my incurred logic stuff says, if it's an incurred row, then we calculate the event amount, matching on type and period, and then getting the subtotal impact.

Unknown Speaker  49:00
Then this guy,

Unknown Speaker  49:09
become

Speaker 2  49:16
balance, really, I

Unknown Speaker  49:26
think we just changed so that

Speaker 1  49:34
I'm getting myself lost thinking we just changed this guy,

Unknown Speaker  49:43
I need to have that argon execution.

Speaker 2  50:25
Already trained.

Unknown Speaker  50:44
Now so the

Speaker 1  50:53
subtotal, you would just do a sum R, G on the events and get the incurred balance for all rows.

Matthias Miller  51:03
Yeah, I think, okay, yeah, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  51:05
I don't know why it's taking me so long to take this through, but so I think this guy is going to go

Unknown Speaker  51:20
event type. But I do need that date,

Unknown Speaker  51:25
project, Summer, G,

Speaker 1  51:59
so for the subtotal, I rip through the RG and I match on type, optionally get incurred rows, do My date check, then that subtotal balance, then tax

Speaker 1  52:28
is so I want a wrapper or a core macro, sort of like this, right? That you could that I share that some of the logic. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  53:45
you would allow a blank as update.

Unknown Speaker  53:51
Yeah, okay, should I really be trying to calculate this as of

Matthias Miller  53:59
when do you, I mean, not for DPO. Do you ever want any other type stuff?

Speaker 1  54:12
I just did this because at that point in time, I was thinking, we might want be able to do that. Otherwise we could just do today, like we do need the date checks right? I'm not sure we need that entry date. What I really care about is to the to the due date. I.

Speaker 1  55:13
This whole framework just feel doesn't feel quite right, and I can't figure out why.

Unknown Speaker  55:34
I think I want

Speaker 1  55:41
where this gets confusing is that we have this calc events amount that is just dead simple, just matching on some of this stuff, yep, some of the key fields, and that's what I'm using in my incurred row, subtotal, balance I'm going on event type, ripping through the RG for this type and period and getting a subtitle impact.

Matthias Miller  56:08
Why would you just change that to the other macro? Change? What? Why would you just change

Speaker 1  56:21
right? Because this one does need to be that, I think.

Matthias Miller  56:27
But would you just use calcubit amount

Unknown Speaker  56:36
up here instead of, yeah,

Matthias Miller  56:46
and by the way, do you

Speaker 1  57:00
I'm trying do, I even, I'm not sure I even use this macro in there. Aren't you literally just like for the balance? Do you're just literally ripping through and getting the subtotal? I'm circling back to where I was.

Matthias Miller  57:22
I mean, are you using this

Speaker 1  57:25
macro, this guy? Yeah, not right now. I think I'm just, I needed it well, I wanted to just see quickly, be able to glance at the row and see what it's at. But I'm used I had it to get the unpaid period dates.

Matthias Miller  57:42
But you showing it on the detail screen. Yeah,

Speaker 1  57:50
I'm lost same. I wonder if I should go in a hole and work on this a while and come back. But I don't know. I think I can push through it. I've just got, I've got two different sets of macros, and it's, yeah, where I have two layers of macros, and I'm, I don't think I'm quite getting I think I'll go skip on the whiteboard a little while and figure out what I need to do, and then, okay, get it figured out. But I think I know roughly what I need to do that I need to I'm calculating based on subtotal and then, but I'm going to have to get, oh, that's why I wanted the incurred row. That's why I wanted that macro. Because I want to rip through, get the incurred the subtotal, remaining subtotal for each incurred row and the tax rate for that curd row, right? That's why. That's why. Okay, I mean, I think I have what I need to go forward. I'm gonna, I'm gonna drag myself through the mud, and I don't think I need to drag you through it at this point. Okay, does that sound right?

Matthias Miller  58:58
Oh, I think that's totally fair. Do you do that and then just pick it, find a time to work on the clicker report?

Speaker 1  59:09
Yeah, when do you want to work on that? We just

Matthias Miller  59:16
just, I don't know it could potentially, I could potentially do four central or something. Tomorrow, I might have some time. I don't know.

Speaker 1  59:26
Okay, I'm going to be heading out around 445, probably, let's

Matthias Miller  59:35
mean I could do, let's shoot for like. I don't know, nine tomorrow Central.

Speaker 1  59:47
I think going at nine, nine to 10, I'm busy. I think,

Matthias Miller  59:55
which time do you think we need? I.

Speaker 1  1:00:00
Uh, 30 minutes.

Matthias Miller  1:00:10
Let's do, like, literally 30 minutes. I can do it right before the yeah, probably, and you can clean up the rest.

Speaker 1  1:00:21
Yeah, I think if we just sit down and do it, it won't take that long.

Matthias Miller  1:00:31
Okay, awesome. Okay, cool.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:35
Thank you. Thank you. Yep. Thank.
