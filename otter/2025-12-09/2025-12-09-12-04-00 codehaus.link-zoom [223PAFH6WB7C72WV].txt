Unknown Speaker  01:38
B, b,

Matthias Miller  01:41
all right. I just realized I used to have a new zfb incident report that I have not used, and I would do well to I've been thinking about creating, I don't know how to do this in a way that's not obnoxious, but having a way to selectively think incident IDs and titles from CFP over into my systems. I don't want everything,

Speaker 1  02:11
yeah, but boy, would it be nice. Could it be a subset of assignees or something,

Matthias Miller  02:17
anything that's assigned to me, probably, or maybe even me your your neck. Yeah, it might just be worth always having them in there. The weird thing is having two incident IDs then, but yeah, all right, pre clicker. I ah,

Speaker 1  02:49
I really need to reboot at some point, because zoom still crashes every single time I join a meeting. Well, it's some sort of crash because it doesn't I can join just fine, but it's gives me two chances to send crash reports. I don't know why. I'm pretty sure I restarted at least once. I don't know.

Unknown Speaker  03:14
Well, okay, did we?

Matthias Miller  03:16
Did we think we had a No, I did a sort and, oh, 466, 6830,

Speaker 1  03:23
I thought it this one, this, this one's okay. Then I didn't realize there's three transactions for it, right? And I looked at them and, okay, fine. It looks good.

Matthias Miller  03:35
Here's another one with three. So this one should cancel itself out. And then we have these guys canceling each other out.

Speaker 2  03:44
And then this guy, I mean, I don't know. I

Speaker 1  03:54
mean, it looks pretty sane to me. I think we could probably tell what's their name. Tell mark and drew say, Hey, this is the list we're going with. Tell us if it

Unknown Speaker  04:05
looks wrong. So then

Matthias Miller  04:12
the easiest way to do this, Ooh, I love this. You gotta have fun. All right, let's do a um, I mean, these are all, let's just do this for fun. Let's do a

Matthias Miller  04:40
we love ourselves a good pipe list. Oh yeah, we live on pipeless, okay, so me and John live on pipe list alone, like that. All right, so I. Should we be worried about, how does the search for all errors work? And should we be worried about its presence? Probably not. We know that everything in here is good. Should be fine. All right, so look account, impact, um, so basically,

Matthias Miller  05:33
let's just do buildings. Let's just do

Matthias Miller  05:54
I mean, because why not? Um, actually, let's do this

Matthias Miller  06:12
fewer things so you don't break things. Yeah, exactly, yeah, exactly, all right. So then we go here,

Unknown Speaker  06:19
and we go

Matthias Miller  06:22
all rows, buildings, model, cash, keys. And then we could just do for starters, we need to change the date subset. And then we need to change this

Unknown Speaker  06:36
guy, this guy, I'm

Unknown Speaker  06:47
Hmm, oh, that's pretty

Matthias Miller  06:49
that's kind of cool building IDs All right. So then here we can do a list substitute this guy, Bin, string value, current item,

Unknown Speaker  07:07
the X key, the limb, Okay, and then here and

Matthias Miller  07:19
I can rely day

Matthias Miller  07:29
3131 24 Okay, and then we should get 444 77, rows. A

Speaker 2  07:44
440 477 what does that mean? Wait, what 400-400-4477

Speaker 1  07:57
like that's the kind of counting or math I've never heard before.

Unknown Speaker  08:01
It's called sloppy talk, math.

Matthias Miller  08:08
I meant 4400 there was a blend between 4400 400

Unknown Speaker  08:15
gotcha, 444 77,

Matthias Miller  08:20
3500, boy, this thing. This thing slow, yeah, just

Unknown Speaker  08:28
tell the guy not to refresh the report too often.

Matthias Miller  08:32
I'm sure this is hammering the server.

Speaker 1  08:35
Oh, that looks like. That looks like 444, 77 to

Matthias Miller  08:41
me, not gonna let it rest. Are you? Nope, it's a hostile work environment. That's one thing you missed in Kansas all our jokes about hostile work environments. All right, wait for it to recalculate row heights and download the content. Well, I mean, it's obviously done loading. Yeah, it looks right, good.

Speaker 1  09:08
So basically, we just give them this report and say, Hey, this is what we think it is. Feel free to review it as much as you want to let the blood be on your own head. Yep.

Matthias Miller  09:20
All right, so this one is 2025, 1209,

Unknown Speaker  09:31
clicker report. All

Unknown Speaker  09:38
right, and then

Matthias Miller  09:41
here, let's do incidents, incidents of cadets, Dev priorities. That's how beatboxing started. Somebody misspelled incidents,

Unknown Speaker  09:56
forgot about that. I don't know where I.

Matthias Miller  10:00
I don't know what job this is part of search.

Speaker 1  10:05
Mismatch, no. Mismatch, three, 500 Yeah, that guy. Here we go.

Matthias Miller  10:29
I can't both of my browsers are creating universal shortcuts, which is just really obnoxious. So I can't, I can't have both investor tools send mail into send mail at The moment. Okay, so drew mark, Insight support.

Matthias Miller  11:22
We still think there's

Unknown Speaker  11:31
a bit more

Unknown Speaker  11:35
more still in the award.

Matthias Miller  11:42
Yeah, just gonna go piece this one

Speaker 2  11:49
after, okay,

Speaker 2  12:00
good, yeah, sweet. Okay, all right, awesome. Later, Yep, yeah, anything, anything you need for me?

Speaker 1  12:10
No, I'm dealing with cut over wrap up and hoping to bury myself back into zrt as soon as possible.

Matthias Miller  12:17
Okay, sounds good. We're hoping to bury you with work. So happy. Berry, awesome, awesome. Thanks. Bye.
