Speaker 1  00:56
Hey, Soner, Is he busy?

Matthias Miller  01:01
He's busy about to hop on with someone, um,

Matthias Miller  01:11
we may need to table this. I think I

Matthias Miller  01:23
let's look up the tax rate for this forest guy. I'm

Speaker 1  01:48
I don't think tax jar has, I mean, not tax jar RTO Pro has even remotely close to thought this through like it looked like they're straight up just summing values across contracts for a period and calculating tax after that.

Matthias Miller  02:06
Zone is pickup. Well, that's great. Doesn't help me.

Matthias Miller  02:21
Eight, we have 823, point, let's do, did you play around with any of this, which like, if we do something like some of this? Stuff.

Speaker 1  02:49
I was I had looked at the main filing report, but not at these guys, 8.466667

Matthias Miller  02:59
I mean, do you think that's what's going on, or is this? I guess that's where I here. Let's go find his receipt number. Wait, he paid with multiple receipts,

Unknown Speaker  03:11
a whole bunch. Wait, what?

Matthias Miller  03:17
No, are they paying each

Unknown Speaker  03:22
he has a separate receipt each

Unknown Speaker  03:25
for each one,

Speaker 1  03:28
but they're so they're paying each period with a different receipt. Yeah, so does RTO pro only support paying one period at a time? No, it's or is it? They just take an amount and then,

Matthias Miller  03:45
yeah, pay it down. When's it do? When's the next thing do?

Matthias Miller  03:55
There's no real payments. It's just

Matthias Miller  04:03
I mean, there's no real periods. I mean, there is just make a payment and what's next. Gotcha?

Speaker 2  04:09
How does that even work?

Matthias Miller  04:18
That's my pay grade. I Great. I mean, you're, you're basically just trying to, trying to collect to the contract value and then figure out what the next due date is. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  04:42
Okay. Taxes zone.

Matthias Miller  04:45
Tax it says, oh, that's the tax zone is 9902 all right, let's go find this tax zone and find out which is.

Matthias Miller  05:00
Well, let's T in this six point 9.25 is what that one says it is. But that's not the rate that we're seeing. Unless,

Unknown Speaker  05:20
is there another? No, that's the only 9902,

Matthias Miller  05:27
tax rate, 925, okay, that is what it is saying. Okay, so then

Unknown Speaker  05:31
they're not charging it. 7283, that was the total.

Unknown Speaker  05:41
Yeah, point 0925,

Matthias Miller  05:47
this is $80 is the subtotal?

Speaker 1  05:53
$80 we're going the wrong way, because the total was 72

Matthias Miller  05:58
sorry, divided by one plus

Unknown Speaker  06:01
six. Help $66.66

Unknown Speaker  06:07
I mean, that looks right. The 617 is that.

Matthias Miller  06:12
Is that different than if we change this sum to Be k8 to k9,

Speaker 2  06:23
this to l9, or really,

Matthias Miller  06:38
251, 64 are we able to tell whether off of this, whether,

Matthias Miller  06:55
whether it's running On a per row or per payment basis?

Unknown Speaker  07:02
It seems like either way it's it's not more granular than per row.

Matthias Miller  07:11
I'm going to guess it's on a per row basis.

Unknown Speaker  07:21
Looks like it.

Matthias Miller  07:38
But the only way to prove it, then is If we have a well, there's a discrepancy. Oh.

Speaker 1  08:02
Well. What happens if you add the two paid together on the 16th and calculate from there,

Matthias Miller  08:12
even if they have different receipts?

Unknown Speaker  08:15
Possibly, I don't know.

Matthias Miller  08:19
It isn't check, payment.

Matthias Miller  08:42
Well, here's the other thing that I want to check as well, which is like, does this make any difference?

Matthias Miller  08:57
No, I guess it shouldn't. But anyway, equals this times one, 1.09250

Unknown Speaker  09:11
we're still a cent off.

Unknown Speaker  09:19
What are they doing?

Matthias Miller  09:37
Me that is very confusing. I

Speaker 1  09:44
What was your what's your formula that's getting 8.0 8.4%

Matthias Miller  09:51
it's, it's a weird divisor. It's, it's the tax of the percentage of the total i.

Unknown Speaker  10:17
Well, that's awfully confusing. They don't even do consistent rounding or something.

Matthias Miller  10:25
Let's try this. Some

Unknown Speaker  10:55
let's round this guy.

Unknown Speaker  11:06
And then let's do, don't you

Unknown Speaker  11:15
have a you're off by one row or something? Yeah, on that last column,

Unknown Speaker  11:37
do like I

Matthias Miller  11:45
Oh, wait, what am I? Something? Something's going wacky. These aren't taxable. We should just delete them. 218,

Speaker 1  12:05
this is, we got another off by one,

Unknown Speaker  12:10
don't we? Or no, this is

Unknown Speaker  12:12
confused. What's going on.

Speaker 2  12:16
That's Oh, five, 200 i here,

Matthias Miller  12:33
5166, eight, yeah, this one's off by g7, j7,

Matthias Miller  12:57
see there it blips and then self corrects,

Unknown Speaker  13:06
and then it's off by one more at the end.

Matthias Miller  13:10
Maybe that's just random.

Matthias Miller  13:27
I wonder if there's a if the payment somehow.

Matthias Miller  13:41
I wonder if it's something like,

Matthias Miller  14:00
how let's do this, minus

Unknown Speaker  14:12
these guys.

Unknown Speaker  14:21
Oh, still not I don't know.

Matthias Miller  14:25
I don't know how they're coming up with that. I really have no idea. I'm not sure if we're ever going to find out.

Speaker 1  14:40
Well, it still seems to me like good, even how they break it down here. I think doing a sales tax liability event row is pretty sane.

Matthias Miller  14:53
Effectively, a sales sales tax liability event row is akin to an invoice. I mean. For all intents and purposes. And so anytime you add you incur monthly fees. Anytime you add a fee, when you add a fee, you get to say, basically, does this get added to a period or not? And then you could conceivably have a sales tax liability row that's separate from

Unknown Speaker  15:25
that monthly payment.

Speaker 1  15:38
That would be, I mean, that's if it's one for a fee, right?

Speaker 1  15:46
Like, if it's just a retrieval or, like a redelivery fee or something, right? Yes, correct. And we charge you $50 plus tax, right?

Matthias Miller  16:02
Well, and it's, it's either the it raises the question, you may want to always create these, even if it's non taxable, just so that, if somebody wants to change the textures, you know, I don't know, the taxes, probably, yeah.

Speaker 1  16:22
Then the annoying thing is that there's a lot more that has to happen to make sure values are right. Because that was what's nice about having it on existing rows. You changed your rate and like, oh, boom,

Unknown Speaker  16:35
right. Works.

Unknown Speaker  16:39
So having a separate row feels like a fair bit of maintenance.

Unknown Speaker  16:49
I'm not sure how. How else you do it?

Matthias Miller  16:52
The only other way to say it is that these arbitrary fees always get tied to a period. Right?

Speaker 1  17:02
Do we ask Dwayne if that's a reasonable I think that's fair, because then you just have the tax, the tax liability stored on rental, the incurred rental row. Right,

Matthias Miller  17:27
yes, correct, do?

Unknown Speaker  17:48
Okay, so how do we move forward? We just need to ask Dwayne. I think, I

Matthias Miller  17:53
think we need to ask him. I don't really know any other way to yeah,

Speaker 1  18:02
do this, yeah, maybe we can talk with him after the update call. Yeah, I think that's are we doing that at that still signature time,

Matthias Miller  18:13
quarter quarter past,

Speaker 1  18:15
yeah, quarter past, yep, okay, okay. Sounds good. We'll talk then, thanks. Thank you. Yep, bye.
