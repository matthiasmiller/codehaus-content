Matthias Miller  00:03
Check

Speaker 1  01:23
Wait, did I miss something? You said 930 and then I saw the calendar is nine o'clock.

Matthias Miller  01:29
You did not miss anything?

Speaker 1  01:33
I go to jump on and I'm like, wait, I'm a half hour late already. Yeah.

Matthias Miller  01:40
No, you could, okay, all right, I can even fix the calendar.

Speaker 1  01:45
No, it just was like, wait, what I thought you said 930 I wasn't paying attention to my calendar until I had to go find your link. And then I was like, I felt like I'd left you down.

Matthias Miller  01:56
Have you? Have you played with Netlify? Yeah, you were talking about it. Yeah, talk about insanity, man, I

Unknown Speaker  02:07
don't know how they make money.

Matthias Miller  02:13
Well, I mean, costs are low. Well, I think I don't know, but I'm like, I don't know if I'll ever want to play for I don't know if I want to pay for WordPress ever again.

Speaker 1  02:29
Well, between between stack blitz or bolt, dot, new, whatever they're calling themselves, I don't know that. Between that GitHub and Netlify. I mean, I think I pay, I don't know, was it 200 bucks a year for for stack blitz that does my my vibe coding, but Netlify is free. Githubs it I've got repos that's free and

Matthias Miller  03:01
public repos, or no, you can have private repo repos, if it's just you, right? Yeah, I'm like, that. I have to pay like, four bucks a month on GitHub. It's terrible.

Speaker 1  03:09
I'm, I'm, it's a little bit shocking. Sometimes it's like, well, I guess, I guess, if you have enough, somehow, obviously, Netlify is making money. I don't know how they do

Matthias Miller  03:19
it, but, well, maybe they're funded somewhere, making money somewhere else. I don't know. I don't

Speaker 1  03:23
know, but it was like, I literally told stack Blitz. It suggested Netlify. And I said, Okay, go, go set it up. It just did, just magically linked up all the stuff that with GitHub and and now, whenever I update my website, I just go over there and it's automatically linked into into GitHub. GitHub is automatically linked into Netlify, and it just works, exactly, just works.

Matthias Miller  03:47
I installed, oh, what is it called? The CMS DCAP CMS for blog, blog posts. I mean, it's just, anyway, it's a different world. And then, like, what is there to hack? I mean, somebody can hack your GitHub, but the site itself, there's nothing to hack,

Speaker 1  04:13
yeah, oh, it's just, it's wild. I mean, granted, I think you know, if you start generating revenue through your website, I expect Netlify would would consider you not to be a free user anymore. But well,

Matthias Miller  04:29
but they don't distinguish between like, they don't distinguish in that. That's not how they're pricing set up. Yeah, it's set up based on usage. Yeah.

Speaker 1  04:39
I mean, it's, I It's kind of shocking, but hey, I like it. Let me

Matthias Miller  04:54
ask new

Speaker 1  04:56
although I will, I just about bet there's some. Sort of interrelationship between Netlify and some of these AI platforms that are that people are building websites with. There's probably some kickback or something.

Matthias Miller  05:11
Yeah, there's a good chance, yeah. I mean, I'm using Claude and I'm like,

Matthias Miller  05:20
I mean, between Gemini. So this is the, here I should show you the, I mean, this is the, this is the ugly go high level website I slapped together for the podcast. And then here's this one. It's just like, Ow, like, you know? I mean, is it? It doesn't, I mean, it looks like $1,000 website still, but like, it's way better than it doesn't look like $100

Speaker 1  05:50
website anymore. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's crazy. What you can do nowadays.

Matthias Miller  05:56
All right, I got two friends of mine who are going into the website business. And I'm like, I don't know real well, but I'm like, Guys, you should totally like, for every small business, like, all of a sudden you could go build a website in a day, go charge 500 bucks a pop, or whatever, get your business off the ground and, like, charge ongoing, you know, something ongoing for hosting, even if you're hosting on Netlify, like, there's so much loving fruit,

Unknown Speaker  06:23
there's a lot of low hanging fruit right now, if you want to chase that, if

Matthias Miller  06:29
you want to chase low hanging fruit, what is processing, what has unmatched records?

Matthias Miller  06:50
Experienced? Well, you don't you're not doing anything with them, silly. I

Matthias Miller  07:04
let's try it new records only, and run fast.

Matthias Miller  07:21
Okay, so we had these,

Matthias Miller  07:33
this guy, these guys, yeah, these are all blank names that's expected. That's good dealer, central company, central reps contracts. Company is a

Matthias Miller  07:57
see, there's a little context where this stuff is coming from. Contracts, assets, products,

Matthias Miller  08:21
Right? Because we said We were

Matthias Miller  08:52
RP inventory which T

Matthias Miller  09:16
Well, that looks promising.

Matthias Miller  09:50
To look at this guy and see what this guy's complaining about. I.

Matthias Miller  10:04
I set ad we don't have, oh, we didn't have the deleted assets yet. That's probably what we should do next. Sadly,

Speaker 1  10:19
I expect they didn't model that up yesterday and put it in they

Matthias Miller  10:22
did. They said it's done.

Unknown Speaker  10:26
Yay for Sean.

Matthias Miller  10:29
So let's do service products.

Matthias Miller  10:50
All right, let's go change this guy and see what breaks.

Speaker 1  10:55
Yeah, but it was there, did there? Did the data come in? I'm presuming it did too well.

Matthias Miller  11:02
Let's see if her fancy little stuff worked.

Matthias Miller  11:09
We said it's there and we pushed it in.

Unknown Speaker  11:12
Don't you love it when things work,

Matthias Miller  11:16
it's glorious. It's a thing of beauty. It is a thing of beauty. All right, so let's say this guy has deleted. All right,

Matthias Miller  11:35
oh yeah, set by RP,

Matthias Miller  11:45
maybe he didn't create an index for this. That wouldn't be good

Matthias Miller  11:56
source inventory I told you to, I'm pretty sure. Nah.

Matthias Miller  12:09
Or no, I did not

Matthias Miller  12:18
well.

Matthias Miller  12:24
You do that for now. Do that for now.

Matthias Miller  12:36
Del in with the

Matthias Miller  12:46
love how you insist on column three. We don't have the invoice

Matthias Miller  13:00
dimensions from Do we have the description?

Matthias Miller  13:26
That's the interesting way to do

Matthias Miller  13:36
it. We said zero is going to be cost seven. We didn't

Matthias Miller  13:53
bring in the category. We

Matthias Miller  14:26
i Why did I miss this stuff? I don't know. Um,

Matthias Miller  14:46
to rental company, Dell inventory store. Date received that was smart, too.

Matthias Miller  15:14
First filled date.

Unknown Speaker  15:20
Date rack,

Matthias Miller  15:43
rental retail. I mean, how much of the stuff? In a lot of ways, it's almost brainless to bring this In. We have this handled already. I

Matthias Miller  16:17
mental retail dictate. Don't really care about that appreciation method

Matthias Miller  16:41
either hurts.

Matthias Miller  17:08
So now let's go

Matthias Miller  17:58
it's sites, the random scrolls in the first column, which We this

Matthias Miller  18:36
brand vendor, okie and description,

Matthias Miller  18:47
hand vendor key in description. We have that. All right, so we need this guy is a string date history.

Matthias Miller  19:10
Okay, so we still have deleted assets quite yet, we're close products. We're waiting on deleted assets, basically, and so we release all the way back to events. This

Matthias Miller  19:38
is not what I remember from yesterday.

Matthias Miller  19:55
Like at all.

Speaker 1  20:58
Sitting here thinking, Why am I so cold? And then look over my thermostat, sipped at 65 man.

Matthias Miller  21:16
You know what? I wonder if

Unknown Speaker  21:49
we, thank God, we,

Matthias Miller  22:08
bomber, bigger clip clipper history. I'm sure it was in my history at some point. Okay, so here, let's not do this. Let's open up this guy. Let's all right. Well, this is that's not as bad as I thought. It could be. Not great, but that bad. Okay, so we have here. We have no we need to start pulling in payments first. That's where we're at, because we have payment linking fields now. So if we

Speaker 1  22:40
Oh, good. So we have nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

Matthias Miller  22:47
So here we have,

Matthias Miller  22:59
well we were supposed to at least payment.

Speaker 1  23:06
I was I was explaining, I was explaining some of this to Kyle last night about how we model, how we model RTO PRO data. And his eyes bugged out. He's like So you're telling me for every for every record in RTO pro, you have that in only as well, yeah, and you can go back and find the source data inside of the software. He's like, that's crazy.

Matthias Miller  23:41
I it's just stuff I take for granted. We take for granted. I can't imagine doing it any other way. It'd be terrible. Can you imagine trying to dump and load CSVs, and

Unknown Speaker  24:01
we will get into some of that.

Matthias Miller  24:03
Okay, so each of these records is one payment, one transaction, correct, a history record. What if they paid multiple contracts on one transaction? How does that have get handled?

Speaker 1  24:20
Well, let's go. Let's go group for for receipt number, and see what, see what we find.

Matthias Miller  24:29
Well, I mean, we have things like this, R, Matt,

Speaker 1  24:37
Matt, R, and what's, what's the deal with him? Did he have

Matthias Miller  24:45
10? It's 109 64 he had a he had a $1,200 refund and a two $80 refund. On top of that, that was a refund. Let's go to this guy. Who are you? Was you? Deborah? Also refund. Well, maybe we should start putting totals in here. Let's just go ahead full on group by this, it is,

Matthias Miller  25:21
refund. Refund.

Unknown Speaker  25:23
So B is always refund.

Matthias Miller  25:26
Well, maybe Sure, look at that way that would explain why we're having such trouble finding stuff. C, C, C, C, hmm, I'm lost in a sea of charges. Maybe, would you stop? There was until it was a glitch, or if they were actually there was, there's some right there? Oh, that's weird.

Unknown Speaker  26:01
Give me. Give me the data on that. Let me look at that.

Matthias Miller  26:04
The account is 2259, for it back in 2017, 2259,

Matthias Miller  26:17
there's a p and a C trans type.

Unknown Speaker  26:23
What was the date 814, 2017, so the negative transaction is its deposit being spent. Okay?

Speaker 1  26:36
And the the 14, 2105 is I'm gonna, I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say the closing transaction.

Matthias Miller  26:46
That seems sane,

Speaker 1  26:49
but we'd have to prove that by looking at a number more.

Matthias Miller  26:53
Well, what I'm trying to find is it like legitimate multi contract situation. I

Matthias Miller  27:14
mean, again, these look like

Matthias Miller  27:24
man who was that guy who had multiple contracts. I

Matthias Miller  27:35
know he had a guy, let's do this. No, here we go. Let's try these. Yeah, different stores, same receipt number.

Speaker 1  27:56
Oh, fun. So we're gonna, we're gonna have to go By store number and receipt number. Yeah,

Matthias Miller  28:16
hey, well,

Matthias Miller  28:30
let's try this. Tools and sub tools only. Let's do some or let's do a RP, source data, history contract, make it a pipe list. And then let's do a another expression that's a pipe list count, make it a negative and sort by that total bad about a boom, call pipe public, let's count

Unknown Speaker  29:07
it was almost bad a boom.

Matthias Miller  29:10
Wait for it. Wait for it. Now it is called it.

Matthias Miller  29:22
Oh, okay, now let's do a actually, we don't have to do totals and subtitles for this. We

Matthias Miller  29:36
can just do this. Yeah, we do okay, well, we'll search for this guy, or we'll subset by it.

Matthias Miller  29:57
Okay, close get these other people out of my way. I.

Matthias Miller  30:04
Yeah, okay, all right. Mel green, we are paying down contracts.

Matthias Miller  30:21
I mean, I would assume that this payment total is, whatever the sum of this stuff is. He made a payment of 929, 36 or five different contracts in 2009 October of 2009

Speaker 1  30:48
Yep, check Number 9174, okay, same receipt, number split over multiples.

Matthias Miller  31:00
So what we need to do then, on the payment record?

Matthias Miller  31:23
Think what we want to do is we want to

Speaker 1  31:29
so every one of those, every one of those receipt numbers, is a record for us.

Matthias Miller  31:36
No, it's well, the receipt numbers, yes, but we're going to pull it off of the earliest time it shows up. So I propose

Unknown Speaker  31:47
some the rest

Matthias Miller  31:49
it was sum them all. I mean, yeah, it'll be totals only, but yes, okay, so we went, I would propose is that we do something like this. I

Matthias Miller  32:12
use an id like that. Store two dash receipt number is that saying for the transaction?

Speaker 1  32:25
Sorry, sorry, sorry. I was looking at your grouping. I was confused. Okay, store, two, dash, yeah, actually, I would reverse it. I do the receipt number, then the store. I don't know. It's just the way my mind thinks

Matthias Miller  32:41
stores, the big bucket, receipts, the little bucket, we can think any number of ways. What's your problem? Genuinely, what's your problem? What's the heading? That's your problem. If I can be that way, you don't want column totals in the heading, then just like I said, be that way. Okay, so

Unknown Speaker  33:03
switch it, switch your route receipt, then store, right?

Matthias Miller  33:08
I did that so I could easily switch it, and then proceeded that too. Okay, so we got the total. We got. We don't need the contract. We are going to need the

Unknown Speaker  33:29
going to go get some water, right back, actually, number one,

Matthias Miller  33:35
okay, so this is the store, and then this is going to Be totals and subtotals.

Matthias Miller  33:58
Not should be asked

Matthias Miller  34:09
if I'll be that way, if this is what you want. Okay, so then, so really, my D Okay, so this one here would be here. We got that one right. This one is, come on, payment, transaction. I payment, confirmation, ID, I don't know if we have an amount really, actually, payment. Payment rental company. All right, let's start by importing one. I'm. Least tell me totals and subtitles are suppressed.

Matthias Miller  35:07
Great. It's going to be by this guy, a macro

Matthias Miller  35:30
let's go move him.

Matthias Miller  35:37
Okay, fine. There. Okie dokie, you like me now? All right, so then do import for a payment.

Matthias Miller  36:01
RP, payments, by RP

Matthias Miller  36:11
history. Okay, let's do a I'm

Matthias Miller  36:37
This can't be that way. So payments by RP history slap.

Matthias Miller  37:13
Payments flat file expert requires an asprompt.

Matthias Miller  37:28
Up for long. It won't,

Matthias Miller  37:36
although we should, what we should do is fat. We can ask

Matthias Miller  37:51
payment, RP, payments by RP, source, history and dx, phi,

Matthias Miller  38:04
that's going to be more complicated. So Did I say anything? All right, like I said, Okay, well, it Oh.

Matthias Miller  38:35
Because there were no records. Matched records. Unmatched records create new record. Well, payment ID confirmation must not exceed eight characters in length. Well, that's fun.

Matthias Miller  38:53
Well, we're screwed customers a required field. Well, that would make sense. Seems useful information

Unknown Speaker  39:01
that's a setting that can be changed. Yes,

Matthias Miller  39:05
yeah. I'm not sure quite how we want to do this if we want to. Let me just find out Johnny, Johnny and Sethi.

Matthias Miller  39:49
Okay, so this would be our piece. Well, let's just grab this off of somewhere else.

Matthias Miller  40:44
Okay, there's, there's the mill that that fixes rental company, it fixes this the date.

Matthias Miller  41:19
We have the date now the payment method.

Matthias Miller  41:27
I guess we could shove it into additional info that wouldn't be terrible.

Matthias Miller  41:46
I said, we have the rental payment method. Is there something Do we have payment methods? I mean, is there payment form.

Matthias Miller  42:08
Do you want to translate this across? What? A k1 a k2 who's paying with the K ones? Do you get equity in that case?

Speaker 1  42:22
K was usually check. I don't remember what the k1, k2, or K, K or K, k1, those are odd. M was usually, is usually MasterCard. V is visa. Although I don't know where some of these other ones are coming from. I've never payment form, oh, my goodness. Or was it CK with check? I don't this is, I wonder. Hold on a second. Hold on, hold on one sec.

Matthias Miller  42:50
Hold On, okay, I'm holding I

Unknown Speaker  43:22
on status, are

Matthias Miller  43:41
All of these going to be six? Well, anyway, you figure that out first.

Speaker 1  43:49
Okay, C equals cash, k equals check, O is money order, M is MasterCard, V is visa, A is American Express, D is discover, B is debit, H is ACH. And then we have 1234, dealer, I don't know what VRT means, custom three and credit card on file.

Matthias Miller  44:19
Okay, so let's start with

Speaker 1  44:22
those are the, those are the payment forms listed in RTO Pro for cricket value.

Matthias Miller  44:27
Oh, you have to go into each of the companies. Yeah. C is cash, okay, but is there? There's not a table that defines this. Is this, is there.

Speaker 1  44:37
I have no idea cash. It does seem like you could create some payment methods, okay, C is cash, then what K is check, okay, O is money order, check.

Matthias Miller  44:53
I don't think we have money order.

Unknown Speaker  44:57
I. M is MasterCard,

Matthias Miller  45:05
other, okay, I just want all the credit cards together. Sure. A is mx, M is

Speaker 1  45:17
MasterCard, V is visa, A is mx, D is discover B.

Speaker 1  45:30
B is a debit card that would probably be considered a credit card as well. B is debit

Matthias Miller  45:36
card. Sorry, what is debit B?

Unknown Speaker  45:39
B, B, as in, boy,

Matthias Miller  45:46
Okay, anything else, H is Ach, okay.

Speaker 1  45:57
And then there is like, 1234, which is dealer VRT custom three, cc on file.

Matthias Miller  46:08
Is there a cc? I mean, is there CC on file? Well,

Speaker 1  46:11
that's what's really, really weird, because there's a use credit card on file button, so I'm not sure what they were using that for.

Matthias Miller  46:21
Well, I mean, you just want those as other or do you want any of them assigned? Sure.

Speaker 1  46:33
Now let me, let me jump into a different store and go look at this and see if there's

Speaker 1  46:52
see much is, see what, see what is crossed over and incorrect. Oh, come on. All

Unknown Speaker  47:00
right, let's look at integrity. All that looks this exactly the same. Let's find a

Unknown Speaker  47:17
that was cricket Valley.

Speaker 1  47:25
You know what? Here's the thing. Anything outside of that is goes in the other and can we wait you were going to put, you were going to put something in more info. So you can't necessarily define what the actual thing was. Well, you could concatenate that with the

Matthias Miller  47:43
in the More Info, yeah, just

Speaker 1  47:45
put, put the type, if it's if it lands in other let's concatenate in what, the what the payment type was out of RTO, RTO, pro, I

Matthias Miller  48:07
Okay, so there's a payment type, and then

Speaker 1  48:18
the question is, are we going to are we going to trigger some kind of looking for credit card if we, if we define it as a card? I don't think so. I mean, for, for our tie out data in the future, with with payment records, no part of me wants to say you put you, you stomp everything as except for check and money order and some of those, like all of the types besides check money order and you want to, do

Matthias Miller  48:50
you want a money order type? We don't have it yet, but we can add one.

Speaker 1  48:58
We should that is, that is a common thing. Anything outside of check, a cash check, cash check, or money order, everything else should be stomped into the other and define it as part of the More Info. That way, we're not going to we're not going to be causing ourselves pain in the future.

Matthias Miller  49:25
All right, I mean, we can do that. Let's check. Um,

Matthias Miller  49:53
okay, so let's do that. Okay, so then now. He paid by check. So we're good, okay, so now, oh, I was going to go over to argue. Wait, what did I need? What was I trying to import this morning? Need a linking field from assets making field and index from only assets to the Dell inventory table, and then we need a money order payment method, and I don't know what. Okay.

Speaker 1  50:45
You wouldn't even need to necessarily define it in more info, because you're going to link out the you're going to link out the records to it anyway, so you can literally go pop over to the source data and see what it was.

Matthias Miller  51:01
I'm confused. I mean, you mean you could go, I'm confused, but

Unknown Speaker  51:14
so I never mind just you're you're good,

Matthias Miller  51:23
okay, well, oh, this would be a payment for contract. I don't know why we don't require that, but

Matthias Miller  51:39
payment for, I wonder what the list is for that payment for items. Okay, fine,

Speaker 1  51:54
so the link to source data, if there's multiple contracts that are being paid by this payment record, which, which source record is going to link to it the earliest one in the system. I wonder if you ought to do a I wonder if that link ought to be some type of report that gives you that that searches that receipt number, or something so that you could find all receipts underneath that number.

Matthias Miller  52:19
It seemed like that would be the worst thing in the world,

Matthias Miller  52:30
unless we want to do we know for sure is the receipt number. I'm sure it is. Let's do this. I

Matthias Miller  52:44
in the history, table, e story, history, let's group totals and subtitles only, yes, by length of the receipt.

Matthias Miller  53:19
Cranky, come on, dude, it's not that hard. I did this as a kid with both my eyes closed, sitting on one leg, hopping uphill. Dude, what's your problem?

Matthias Miller  53:42
Like, seriously, what's the problem?

Matthias Miller  53:50
You broke it that should not be happening. Goodness gracious, that is not that.

Matthias Miller  54:05
Okay, let's not do this. Let's not do totals and subtitles only. Let's just do this. That worked. Now, let's do totals and subtitles only. Oh, because we don't have a let's do a one. Let's sum There we go. All right, there are always 1010, characters.

Matthias Miller  54:32
So we could, however, we want to do this, but realistically, you could just search by customer and then sub sub filter by, okay, that's fine. Um, now let's go. Take the subset off. It

Matthias Miller  55:11
looks a little different. Let's also save this guy while we're at it. You

Matthias Miller  55:34
and there you go.

Unknown Speaker  55:44
Wait. Are you saying? Are you saying this is, this is

Matthias Miller  55:48
what's going to get in here. This is what's

Unknown Speaker  55:50
going to go in as payment records. Yeah, except, shouldn't we be scared? Why?

Matthias Miller  56:01
I I love it. I feel like we should do some kind of why

Speaker 1  56:13
is there one in there without a without a name on it? I don't know. Well, you're supposed to know these things.

Matthias Miller  56:21
Oh, I can find these things. Tell me what happened to Catherine Richardson. That's not that familiar name, I don't know. Well, go find her. 3973, customer. Catherine, oh, yeah, let's go into actually even better folders. Customer, I think customers. Catherine, Catherine, I

Matthias Miller  57:03
Catherine Richardson, where are you? Store? Two count. She doesn't have any you know, it's 3973, uh, she paid on a different store.

Unknown Speaker  57:27
Oh, I know. What's the receipt? Number 3892 What's the date? 30 there's 3892

Matthias Miller  57:39
six, number five and her accounts under two. What?

Speaker 1  57:51
Okay, I suspect we've got some cross up happening.

Matthias Miller  57:59
Well, this isn't an issue with her import. Does she actually exist in both companies? I don't know. That's what Richardson right. Richardson,

Unknown Speaker  58:11
Catherine, Richardson, I show her as under store five,

Matthias Miller  58:19
which I show her as under store too.

Speaker 1  58:28
I don't understand.

Matthias Miller  58:31
Let me see if I'm Let me double check

Matthias Miller  58:40
where was here is store two on her customer record. Now let's check the I have a thought though advanced shows standard RP, source, customer, import your matching on store and account, We should, I mean, am I?

Speaker 1  59:21
Okay? So let's see if I can figure out how to reproduce it. What do I want to search? If I search for 39733973, it comes up underneath store, five.

Matthias Miller  59:38
Can you check the sequel? Recount, 39733973,

Speaker 1  59:50
let's go to the SQL. I want rev menu. I want SQL strings. I want all customer or. Records, and now I need to find the account numbers. Where's my account numbers? Account numbers. Let's make sure that we are sorting according to that. Oh, this could take me a minute to get there. 3973 correct.

Speaker 1  1:00:35
Seven, three, okay, you highlight you Now where's My Store Number.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:49
Come on. Where are you?

Speaker 1  1:01:16
Seriously, what's going on? Okay, all customer, all customers,

Matthias Miller  1:01:29
name account, contract balance open again, okay, customers contracts, deal with no account, well, customers with deposits, I Yeah,

Matthias Miller  1:01:45
you should just be able to Do Select Store from customers where account equals, yeah. Well,

Unknown Speaker  1:02:08
let's try this. Let's try all contracts. Account Number, I'm

Matthias Miller  1:02:29
Oh, good gracious, you. Uh,

Speaker 1  1:02:50
okay, so let's do this. Uh, cancel, cancel guys. Okay, go away. You do your thing right there. Where's my what the world just happen. Okay, fine, your stupid little tool is stupid.

Matthias Miller  1:03:05
Select customers,

Unknown Speaker  1:03:08
no, all customer records, customers where store equals two. Would that work?

Matthias Miller  1:03:23
Let's find out it'll show it. Oh yeah, well, okay, but

Speaker 1  1:03:29
I'm not showing but why is it? It's not okay. Let's see. Can we do? Is this customers, where store equals two and

Matthias Miller  1:03:43
and account equals three, yeah, but what's

Speaker 1  1:03:46
it called? What's it called, What's, what's the field called,

Matthias Miller  1:03:49
which field, account, A, C, C, O, U, N, T, yeah, okay.

Unknown Speaker  1:03:56
Equals what's, what's the number

Matthias Miller  1:03:59
33973, we'll

Speaker 1  1:04:02
see if this works. Run. Okay, no way. Kathleen Richardson does show up in two, and let's try five. Run and she does not show up in five. One world. Who has her but

Matthias Miller  1:04:21
who has her but who has her contract?

Speaker 1  1:04:29
Okay, so let's do this wins when the whoops that won't work. This is not this is a stupid hate this. Okay, contracts, let's go down to contracts, contracts, contracts, contracts, contracts, contracts, contracts, all contracts where store equals five and what's the what's the. Is it contract? Is it just contract for the number?

Matthias Miller  1:05:03
Yeah, yeah, I think so.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:07
No, I can't just be contract.

Matthias Miller  1:05:09
Wait on what on what record?

Speaker 1  1:05:12
What's the contract? What's the contract number field called

Matthias Miller  1:05:15
on the on the contract itself, which which record

Speaker 1  1:05:21
in the database on contracts, yeah, what do they what do they call it contract? Just contract, yeah, data, contracts. Okay, and contract. What's her contract number? Oh, I'm

Matthias Miller  1:05:44
Oh, good. In a minute it's we're not seeing I'm not seeing a contract for her. Maybe this is one of the ones we had trouble importing. I didn't think she was I didn't think that was name is awfully familiar. I'm not seeing a contract for her. Just look at, I mean, just search contacts for her customer account number and and then store two or store three.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:19
Wait a minute and

Speaker 1  1:06:26
3973, right? Yeah, yeah, no way. Contracts in five, customers in two.

Speaker 1  1:06:47
If we overwrite this, if we overwrite our records and move her over to store five it's going to get written back, isn't it,

Matthias Miller  1:06:58
into our system? Yeah, yeah, it'll catch up. Everything will work.

Speaker 1  1:07:03
No, I'm saying, What if we just do it in our system? It won't it won't stick.

Matthias Miller  1:07:07
Oh, right. No, it won't stick, right? I

Speaker 1  1:07:10
have no idea how you even change a store for a customer. SQL. I don't know how to write SQL to push in the database.

Matthias Miller  1:07:20
Well, how careful Are you?

Unknown Speaker  1:07:23
Well, it's a closed contract, so I don't care.

Matthias Miller  1:07:26
No, I mean, like update.

Speaker 1  1:07:31
Hold on. Richardson. Kathleen Richardson, let's, let me just try and see what's here. Contract maintenance. Nope, not contract maintenance. I want to go in query,

Matthias Miller  1:07:44
something like that,

Unknown Speaker  1:07:47
something like, what, oh, you said, as

Matthias Miller  1:07:49
long as just double check my numbers. You should probably also Hang on. Let me check one thing maintenance. You would probably you should probably also do this just to limit the update queries are terrifying to me.

Speaker 1  1:08:16
Update customer, set store where account equals 3973, and store equals to limit one, yeah? So,

Speaker 1  1:08:33
all right, you want me just to put that in his little thing, which you can see what happens? Yeah. All right. Are we ready for it to explode? Let's see what happens. Revenue, menu, custom SQL strings, control, V, run, invalid or legal SQL string.

Matthias Miller  1:09:02
Let's see. What's it. Griping about, I don't know. This is Firebird, right? Yeah. Gemini. Gemini, what is the equivalent in Firebird?

Matthias Miller  1:09:21
Your friend who had a Firebird,

Unknown Speaker  1:09:25
Pontiac Firebird, we're showing our age.

Matthias Miller  1:09:31
No kidding, there's a Facebook post recently, what? What is it? What is the term? What is what is the term or phrase that you can use that the younger generation totally would not understand my immediate, not immediate, but after No, it's Rose one.

Speaker 1  1:09:51
Oh, so which? Oh, which 1am I using? Okay, you copied, oh, you copied it. C, back over here to this. Okay, stop it, Ctrl, V, run invalid or illegal SQL string. He's probably blocking you from writing to the database through this little thing.

Matthias Miller  1:10:31
Oh, that's possible. What's the message? Illegal or

Speaker 1  1:10:36
invalid or illegal SQL string? I

Speaker 1  1:10:47
can we run it? Can we run it against the is there a way to run it against the database itself? By Firebird, through flame Robin?

Matthias Miller  1:10:56
Well, I don't know. Probably I've never used flame Robin.

Unknown Speaker  1:10:59
Yeah, me neither. I was hoping you were gonna be like, oh yeah.

Matthias Miller  1:11:04
I mean, I would expect,

Unknown Speaker  1:11:12
let's see what happens. Where are you? I thought flame Robin was in here.

Speaker 1  1:11:30
Yeah, there it is. Okay. So what happens? Local Host, RTO, RTO, depreciation, RTO tables. It just gives me a breakdown of the tables. I don't know how you would write against

Matthias Miller  1:11:44
there should be a surely, there's some kind of like database, run SQL or like,

Speaker 2  1:11:50
register certain, retrieve, Manage Users, view database,

Unknown Speaker  1:11:57
execute SQL statements.

Matthias Miller  1:11:59
Yep, exactly.

Unknown Speaker  1:12:01
So Control V

Matthias Miller  1:12:05
pretty much and run that thing.

Speaker 1  1:12:08
Statement, dynamic, SQL, error, SQL, error. Code, dash equals, Dash 204, table, unknown customer at line two,

Matthias Miller  1:12:20
use database or RTO Pro, RTO PRO data, something like I would expect it to be like that.

Speaker 1  1:12:38
So where does that get inserted? Before or after, before with the semicolon, breaking

Matthias Miller  1:12:47
it, yeah, semicolon, breaking it, I.

Matthias Miller  1:13:03
It does not have a use command. It will trigger. Oh, never mind. Yep, that didn't work. Are you connected to it?

Speaker 1  1:13:09
For sure, I have no idea. You know what. Why don't I just get you in here, rather than me trying to do this

Matthias Miller  1:13:18
with you, doing it on your own, I

Unknown Speaker  1:13:26
How

Matthias Miller  1:13:32
do you like me? Now? Cloud, all right, so

Matthias Miller  1:13:47
you finally did is, did you open the database yet?

Speaker 1  1:13:49
Go to C, drive, oh, you're in. You're in. C, yeah, okay, quick about There you go. That one right there. I don't know if I opened the database or not.

Matthias Miller  1:14:01
I Where is it you're looking for? These are, oh, though it's opening at SQL script, Okay, never mind,

Matthias Miller  1:14:16
um, oh, it's this is why. Done. Wait. What did you see? Tempted update during read only transaction can be because the transaction is inquiry only. So how do I statement? I Okay. This is, what is this? Called flame Robin. Uh huh. How do I update a Firebird database using flame Robin? It's. Sounds like something a kid would do with some gasoline and some birds,

Unknown Speaker  1:15:06
something a 10 year old boy would do with bird exactly,

Matthias Miller  1:15:13
connect to the database. Yes. Okay, right click, run career, launch SQL Editor, which I'm assuming, right? But it says this. It says the transaction. Transaction is inquiry only. I can't type. I

Matthias Miller  1:16:01
database registration. Okay, well, let's do this. Go back here. Oh, that's the wrong one.

Speaker 1  1:16:10
Wait, hold on, hold on hold on hold on change up, change it, change it before you do add the s to update customers. Oh, well, sure, and let's try this run.

Matthias Miller  1:16:22
If I run selected, ah, darn it.

Unknown Speaker  1:16:27
I was really hoping.

Matthias Miller  1:16:37
Well, thank you. That was real helpful. I appreciate that. It gives me a lot of insight into the situation.

Matthias Miller  1:16:47
Disconnect. Now just connect, but I want to see the settings, disconnect, connect. That. Okay, so we have roll. I mean, there should be no reason.

Matthias Miller  1:17:20
Customers, okay, let's do this first. Then that's the La Vista. Execute

Matthias Miller  1:17:39
statements. Yes, no, I don't know how to get I

Matthias Miller  1:17:56
don't even know how to I mean, there's nothing here that even lets me see whether this is maybe it'll give Me property. I

Matthias Miller  1:18:14
click the x3 times it goes away.

Matthias Miller  1:18:23
Database, preferences,

Matthias Miller  1:18:34
windows, file permissions, okay,

Matthias Miller  1:18:48
G fixed.

Matthias Miller  1:18:57
Mon Read Only from mon database. Okay, let's do this. Execute select Mon, read only, rat only from mon data, mon database, unknown column, read only, read it was read only, wasn't it? Then underscore. So send it, okay,

Speaker 1  1:19:31
yeah, but there's probably, there's probably any number of people actually on the database right now.

Matthias Miller  1:19:38
Oh, so then then multi instance shouldn't be an issue. Okay? I don't think

Matthias Miller  1:19:57
file permissions Go ahead.

Speaker 1  1:19:59
What I. What I can do is I can have Francine reach out to RTO Pro and ask them how to do it, once we know how to do it, then, because I suspect that this dear, delightful cast learning what's been called Richardson is probably not the only one we're going to have to

Matthias Miller  1:20:17
resolve here. Let's do database registration. Pro role is admin, I mean, like I

Matthias Miller  1:20:46
yeah, I guess that is another question

Matthias Miller  1:21:01
inside up our transaction. Edit transaction settings, okay, let's try this. Just a handful of more things yet. Execute SQL. There is no transaction file. Edit View.

Matthias Miller  1:21:50
History, transaction settings, concurrency, isolation, dirty, read Wait for lock, resolution, read only, transaction,

Matthias Miller  1:22:38
so I guess there is a, maybe there is A small, okay, let's try this one more time, though. I'm just going to try restarting flame Robin. I don't expect it

Matthias Miller  1:22:55
to be any different, but read only transaction.

Matthias Miller  1:23:09
Transaction settings,

Matthias Miller  1:23:57
we get this one last shot, And if not, I

Matthias Miller  1:24:19
commits a transaction rewrite. I

Matthias Miller  1:24:44
explicit transaction start. I'm.

Matthias Miller  1:25:14
Okay, let's try this. I

Matthias Miller  1:25:35
on that

Matthias Miller  1:25:42
we what does it say? The role is now?

Matthias Miller  1:25:51
No, it has a blank rule.

Speaker 1  1:25:54
So grok says, use D, beaver or Firebirds is Q, l, command line tool. If flame Robbins being ridiculous.

Unknown Speaker  1:26:07
Okay, do you have either of those? Not, not on the

Speaker 1  1:26:11
not on here? No, you'd have to. You'd have to install them. I don't know Firebirds is QL. I don't know that that would be in there.

Matthias Miller  1:26:22
It's probably it wouldn't be surprised actually, if it is.

Matthias Miller  1:26:39
Yeah, well, you appreciate that now, or you want to table it

Speaker 1  1:26:45
and come back a message Francine, and she's going to reach out to RTO Pro and get away to do this, because we're going to do this at the database level, because otherwise it's going to write it right back over again, right? And we can't, we can't handle the mismatch.

Matthias Miller  1:27:03
Do we have more? Oh, yeah, we have more. I mean, I mean, I don't know that. I don't know the exact cause of it, but we do have more blank customers, sure.

Speaker 1  1:27:12
Okay, so that like we gotta, but it's, wouldn't surprise me, if that's the gonna be, we're gonna run into that issue quite often.

Matthias Miller  1:27:19
I think we're going to have to have a way to we're not going to want to import all. What am I trying to say? We're going to have to create a master list. Our whole import is driven off contracts. What contracts do we pull? And it ripples out from there. Make sense? So we go find out what contracts we want based on those contracts we import. We don't have to. I mean, we could we go however far we want to, but we import those stores, we import those customers, we import those payments. Well, those customers payments, keeping in mind,

Speaker 1  1:28:10
we're going to get the one thing, the one thing that I think we probably got to think through is that we're only importing contracts based on the last two years when they closed. So the payment history table is going to go way back further than that. We're going to figure out how to we going to figure out how to weed some of this out. So otherwise, you're going to run into all kinds of mismatch

Matthias Miller  1:28:27
or well, then what happens? What happens when you have a customer owned security deposit, and it's partially I don't know if this ever happens, but I don't know, disentangling stuff from the last two years could be a

Matthias Miller  1:28:53
security deposits are the only thing I can Think of that could get tricky disentangling it, but I

Speaker 1  1:29:03
Well, we're at the end of the time that you expect. So I would say, make yourself a bunch of notes. This is probably what we should this is probably what we should heavily work on next week.

Matthias Miller  1:29:17
Yeah, it is because

Speaker 1  1:29:21
we're gonna, we're gonna, we're gonna have to this. This is where this is, this is where the proverbial manure gets real.

Matthias Miller  1:29:30
What's Okay, quick question, what's the downside of importing all historical contracts?

Speaker 1  1:29:37
There isn't, there isn't downside. It was, I was I was just trying to limit the amount of information that we're yanking understandable. So if it makes more sense to bring all history in, then let's bring all history in it, because it would, it's going to probably simplify the payment conversation a smidge. Probably.

Matthias Miller  1:30:01
But it's going to be a fatter, longer import, especially on the history rows. Okay, awesome. Let's talk next week.

Speaker 1  1:30:14
One talk next week. We're gonna do more. Let's work next week. Let's work

Matthias Miller  1:30:18
next week, right? Exactly

Speaker 1  1:30:21
I'm getting I'm coming in Monday, and I think my Airbnb is within walking distance of your office, if I remember correctly, sweet.

Unknown Speaker  1:30:31
So we should probably chat at some point about agenda and times and and so forth.

Matthias Miller  1:30:40
Well, let me know what times I'm I'm pretty flexible up until 4:45pm so

Speaker 1  1:30:46
well, like I said, I'm my Airbnb should be within walking that's good double check this, but I'm pretty sure it's within walking distance, which means I can, I can be at the office whenever you so jolly well wish. Okay, and then whenever, whenever we decide to knock it off for the day, then that's what we'll do. But it would be, it would be really cool if we can just grind away on this and figure this out and get this out of the way. That That being said, the other, the other option, is to say we do a bunch of design stuff to keep the team good and busy, and just ignore this for a bit, because this, this work, doesn't exactly keep the team busy.

Matthias Miller  1:31:32
No, it does not at all. It's going to make the problem compoundingly worse. And I guess the question I would always ask is, how are we going to be what is going to make us maximally? Okay? Are we going to get more benefit working on imports together in the same room? We're going to benefit more from working on design together in the same room for an extended period of time? And maybe it's design is priority number one. And whenever we get tired,

Unknown Speaker  1:31:59
don't say that when you get tired, we do not want to go work on

Matthias Miller  1:32:02
imports. As well. Okay, so sounded good in my head.

Speaker 1  1:32:09
Yeah. No, we should. We should work on, on design stuff that we should try to knock out a bunch of things to keep the team rocking.

Matthias Miller  1:32:18
Yep, sounds good. I like it.

Speaker 1  1:32:22
The only thing I would, I would say to this whole payment stuff, is there a? Is there a simple Is there a simpler way that we can Is there a? Is there a? What am

Speaker 1  1:32:40
I trying to say? We are trying. We are trying to model RTO PRO data into our model. Is there? Is there a way that we can do this that does not require us to do that. So, okay, like,

Matthias Miller  1:33:06
one option is we could collapse all RTO PRO data into a single line and you say, as of

Speaker 1  1:33:15
this, that's exactly what I'm I'm kind of chasing. It's like, Can is it this is probably not what I'm, what you're the right way. But like, can we shove a lot of this data into a note and then, you know, match up contract balances and and be like, okay, you know what? The moment we go forward, from this point in time forward, we're gonna, everything's going to, going to work properly. But you know, because I'm a little bit nervous that we are going to grind away on this and just run into wall after wall after wall

Matthias Miller  1:33:47
after wall. Well, but why couldn't we? Why couldn't we just incur? Why could we just have opening entries and incur rent for everything that's been incurred to date? Incur payment for everything that's been paid to date. Incur fee late fees for all late fees that have been incurred to date, which I don't even know, like you wouldn't even technically have to do that to do that, except for outstanding late fees or unpaid periods. No. Even on unpaid periods, you would incur all your late fees so you have you would incur unpaid late fees.

Speaker 1  1:34:34
Yeah, just how would this work? Like? As you onboard people throughout the year, are you just going to tell them? Look, you don't want to fire up accounting until you hit your your crossover point of a of a year, whatever, whatever, whatever, your books, however you operate, your books, whenever you consider it that to be a year's point, that would be the crossover point. Because I bet, how do you how do you build historical you.

Matthias Miller  1:35:00
Yeah, that's, I mean, that's the point. You can't, I mean, and even even there, you can't until you've done at least one to two years. If you, if you onboard in January, you have to wait until you have a full year. And so I think that means we're basically screwed if we on the from the accounting side, if we do that, it's good point.

Speaker 1  1:35:20
So we, I mean, the only, the only right way to do this is to model it exactly as it happened, and then you can tie out all your accounting transactions accordingly, right? So, I mean, I think, I think the right answer, I think the answer is, we grind away at this until we both look at each other and say, It's impossible.

Matthias Miller  1:35:39
Okay, it's not answer.

Speaker 1  1:35:42
I mean, it's not what like this is, this is the kind of work that neither you are. I get really excited about, but it's,

Matthias Miller  1:35:49
it's got to get done. Yeah. I mean, if we well, I say it's got to get done. I mean, this is the number one bottleneck that our friends in Wichita are struggling with. Yep.

Speaker 1  1:35:58
So, so if we solve the bottleneck, then guess what? We are better than they are.

Matthias Miller  1:36:09
Ego boost. All right, good. See you next week. Safe travels. Have a good weekend. All right, we'll talk. All right, thanks.
