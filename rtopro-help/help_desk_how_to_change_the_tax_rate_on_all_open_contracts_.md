The function [Tax Rate Change](rto_pro_manual_store_setup_information.md#tax_rate_change) can be found under the Sales Tax tab, in [Store Setup Information](rto_pro_manual_store_setup_information.md) (Setup menu option 1). This function will change all open contracts from one given tax rate to another. 

This should only be used when not using Tax Zones. 

To edit tax rates when using Tax Zones you either edit individual tax zone records, or if you are using TaxJar you can use the [TaxJar Refresh Contracts](taxjar_refresh_contracts.md) feature.
