FAQ-Frequently Asked Questions

Q: What type of contracts can be printed?

A: Any contract that can be run through a printer can be setup for printing or you can have RTO Pro print your entire contract on blank paper. The contract layout is easily edited for your specific contract or we can give you a source to purchase contracts that we have layouts premade for. We will also create a layout for you for no extra charge if you send us 10 of your contracts.

Q: Is support available?

A: Yes, you get 90 days free support and upgrades when you purchase the full version of the software. After that support is $40.00 per incident and upgrades are $299.00 to $599.00 depending on how long it has been since your last upgrade. Or you can select our Gold Support Plan which includes unlimited support and free upgrades for only $50.00 per month or $450.00 a year per store.

Q: How many customers can RTO Pro handle?

A: That is limited only by the size of your hard drive, basically it is unlimited.

Q: With RTO Pro can you take payments on customers with multiple contracts simultaneously.

A: Yes, a customer can have up to 10 active contracts (and each contract can have up to 10 inventory items on it) and you can take a payment on all of them or just the ones you want. You can take partial payments on some and full payments on others at the same time also, or multiple payments. You can also select for each separate contract the # of payments, the amount or the date you want it to be paid through. Even with multiple contracts and each one being paid differently.

Q: How much does RTO Pro cost?

Q: Are there security features and password protection in RTO Pro?

A: Yes there are 5 employee security levels, you determine what your employees can do based on the level you assign them and the required level you set each password protected function to. For instance you could set yourself to a level 5 and set all other employees at 4 or below, then set delete inventory to a level 5, this means only you would be able to delete inventory.

Q: Does RTO Pro do billing / invoicing.

A: Yes, when you load contracts you select whether you want them to be billed or not, you can even customize the layout of the invoice. See [Billing](rto_pro_manual_billing.md) and [Edit Letters](rto_pro_manual_edit_letters.md).

Q: How do you get from one field (a text box where you can enter information) to another on a screen?
