Below are the definitions for the highlighted sections on the sample report below.

(8). Grand total of all monies received. Note this does not always equal the total of revenue listed above, customer deposit paid(which is listed further down on the report) is money in your drawer, but it is not revenue so is not added in total revenue. Deposit spent becomes revenue but is not included in the total money received since it was not paid today, it is simply moving from customers deposit account to revenue.
