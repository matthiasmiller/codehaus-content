Web Invoices / payment requests are now available to stores using the RTO Pro webpay service. 

A web invoice is where you can generate a request for a payment, with the ability to enter multiple items with prices for each, that will be displayed on a web page through a link you can email or text to customers. The customer can view the invoice and pay online using a credit card. You can view web invoices from the webpay master login, when they are paid you will receive a notice by email. The charge per paid web invoice is the same as the charge for webpay payments. There is no additional paperwork to fill out, if you use our webpay service you can start using this feature right away. This is useful when requesting payment for something not yet loaded in RTO Pro, like the down payment for a new agreement.

You can create a web invoice from option D on the point of sale menu, or you can click the button on the payment screen to create one for an existing customer.
