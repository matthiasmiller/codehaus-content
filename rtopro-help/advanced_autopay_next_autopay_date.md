This option is under the Credit Card / ACH tab.

When you set up autopay with advanced settings, where you enter the date(s) to pay instead of paying on the due date the default option is to advance the next autopay date when payment is paid by autopay. With this new option enabled the next autopay date will be advanced 1 term for any payment on that contract, a regular payment or webpay payment.

For example, if you have a contract set to pay by advanced options on 9/10/2021, if the customer paid a regular payment on 9/8/2021 the autopay payment would still process on 9/10, unless you manually adjusted the next AP date. With this new option enabled the next autopay date would be advanced 1 term for any payment, so if they are monthly and pay 9/8, their next autopay date would get advanced to 10/10/2021 and autopay would not run on that contract until then.

Please note if an agreement is setup to pay only 1 payment by autopay, then have autopay turned off, with this option set a regular payment paid after the autopay is setup would turn off autopay on that agreement also.
