Problem: Error 5 Invalid Procedure call when transferring inventory in.

Cause: This error is caused by transferring inventory out with an older version of RTO Pro, then the inventory not being transferred in by anyone, then using the same disk to do a transfer out with a newer version of RTO Pro. In this situation when you go to transfer in the error will come up.

Fix: The only way this can be corrected is to manually receive these items into the store. Do not use the same disk for transfers again unless it is formatted or all files deleted from it.
