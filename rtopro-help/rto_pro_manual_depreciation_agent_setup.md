Inventory Menu Option "A"

This screen is used to setup Depreciation / Inventory Agents. Inventory agents are a way to split inventory into groups for whatever reason you may need to split inventory into groups. Typically this is just used for depreciation purposes.

When you go into this all the agents will be shown in a list. Highlight the agent you wish to edit and push ENTER. 

You can put in a depreciation type and set a last depreciation run date for both tax and book depreciation. Tax depreciation is typically what you would report to the IRS, whereas book depreciation is typically used for your own internal purposes, if used at all.

You can also delete an agent from the edit screen, if you choose to delete an agent you will be prompted to select another existing agent to move the items to that are under the agent you are deleting. To delete an agent push F4 on the Edit Agent screen.

ALL AGENTS

There is a special agent you can add and name "ALL AGENTS". If you wish to use this agent it will depreciate all inventory on 1 report. If you use this agent it should be your only agent that is setup to depreciate. This is useful for when you wish to use the inventory agent field for something like a vendor or supplier name. When you run a depreciation report for "All Agents" the report will include all inventory items no matter what agent they have been assigned to.
