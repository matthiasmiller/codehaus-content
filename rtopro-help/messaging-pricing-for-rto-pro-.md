Common questions:

"Why is the outgoing message screen limiting me to 160 characters when I am using App Messaging?"

There is no way to know if the message will go out by SMS or to the messaging app, only the server knows when it tries to send by the app if it can be sent by the app, all messages are sent by SMS if they can't be sent by the app. If we can ever switch to using the app only we will increase the number of characters allowed, but don't know if that will ever be a possibility, since you can't force your customers to install the app and keep it installed.

"Since App Messaging is limited to 160 characters also is it really saving me money?"

Even though the interface limits you to 160 characters if you use fields or quickpay links your message could end up being over 160 characters, so if you send 10,000 messages and a field or quickpay link makes them go over 160 characters for SMS you are charged 20,000 x .03 = $600.00. If they go out by the app instead you are charged 10,000 x .02 = $200.00.

Also for incoming messages that go over 160 characters you are charged multiple charges per message for SMS(1 charge per 160 characters), through the app you are not.
