To get started loading your customerâs information first you must receive inventory that is out on rent, (See [Receiving](rto_pro_manual_receiving.md).) Then you will be ready to load contracts, See [New Rental / Lease Contracts](rto_pro_manual_new_rental_lease_contracts.md)

Inventory that is on rent must be received before you can load the contracts that they are on. So to get started as quickly as possible you should receive the inventory that is rented out first then load the contracts, then you can go back and receive all stock inventory.

There are instructional videos on the RTO Pro website that walk you through some basic functions in RTO Pro, it is recommended you watch these videos. The web address is: <http://www.rtopro.com/video_main.html>

If you have customers that have been paying you payments before you started using RTO Pro:

There are 3 options you have to load these customers in RTO Pro. These 3 options are listed below from easiest(least time to load) to hardest(most time to load).

1\. Load the agreements in RTO Pro with their balance. If a contract was originally 24 months and the customer has 12 months remaining, load it as a 12 month agreement in RTO Pro, you can always look back at your old records for their past history.

2\. Load the agreements in the "Load Existing Contracts" program with their original contract terms and enter 1 payment to represent the total of all past payments they have made.

3\. Load the agreements in the "Load Existing Contracts" program with their original contract terms and enter their COMPLETE PAYMENT HISTORY. Doing it this way will take longer but you would have their complete history available in RTO Pro with this method.

Note about printing contracts in RTO Pro: When printing contracts in RTO Pro you have 2 options or ways of doing it. Contracts can be printed from the Point of Sale menu option 5 ["Print / Preload Contracts"](rto_pro_manual_contract_printing.md) and also option 2 ["New Rental / Lease Contracts"](rto_pro_manual_new_rental_lease_contracts.md). Where you print the contract from usually depends on when you are collecting the money. If you are collecting the money and the customer is signing the contract now, you could do it all from option 2, print the agreement and load it in 1 step.

If you want to print the agreement now, but you are not collecting the money until later you should print the agreement from option 5, then when you collect the money load the agreement from option 2. When you print an agreement from option 5 and go into option 2 and pull up the customer a "Printed Contract" screen will come up, showing the information about the contract that was printed. To load this contract simply push Enter and then push Enter through all of the loading screens, you will see that everything has been filled from before. You can make any necessary changes if you wish as loading.

There is a report that you can run to show contracts that have been printed but not loaded, and you can also have this information print on the [End of Day report](rto_pro_manual_getting_started.md#rto_pro_end_of_day) also. See [Printed Contracts not Loaded Report.](rto_pro_manual_load_a_club_agreement.md)
