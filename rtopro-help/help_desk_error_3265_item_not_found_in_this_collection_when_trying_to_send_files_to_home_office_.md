Problem: Error 3265 Item not found in this collection. When trying to send files to Home Office.

Cause: Installing an upgrade with data changes while there are files to be sent to the home office can cause this. For instance, if on Monday night files are created to be sent to Home Office, but not sent for some reason, then on Tuesday an upgrade is installed that has database changes, this error would come up when you try to create files for Home Office Tuesday night.

Fix: In the Income and Deposit Report from the first screen click on "Home Office Functions". Then click on "Send Existing File to Home Office". After sending the existing file you will be able to create new files to send.
