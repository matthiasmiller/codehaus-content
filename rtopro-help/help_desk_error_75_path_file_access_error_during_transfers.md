Problem : When doing a transfer out or in you get the following error: Error 75 Path / File Access error.

Cause: This can be caused by a bad disk that is being used to hold the transfer file (The A: drive usually). It can also be caused by the file "transfer.bak" being marked as "Read Only". This file will be located in the data path on the computer that is getting the error.

Fix: Try using a new disk, the best diskâs to use for transfers are Zip Diskâs, they are much more stable than 3 1/5" floppy diskâs. Check to make sure "Transfer.bak" is not marked as Read Only.
