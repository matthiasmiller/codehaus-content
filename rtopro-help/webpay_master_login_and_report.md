The RTO Pro Webpay system (RTOwebpay.com) has a master login feature that allows store employees to view your customers records online and view reports of payments paid online. With this feature a store employee could take a payment for a customer while at the customers house. This feature can also be used to reset a customers password for them. This feature could be used anywhere you have internet access and a internet browser. This feature can be used on Ipads, Iphones, Android devices and Windows phones and tablets. 

To access the master login page type the URL here from any browser: [www.rtowebpay.com/master](http://www.rtowebpay.com/master)
