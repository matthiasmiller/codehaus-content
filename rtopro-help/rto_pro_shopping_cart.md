For users who have signed up for the webpay service there is a new shopping cart feature available. The shopping cart can be used with any website for customers to add things to the cart and pay for them, with credit card, which would use your same merchant account as your webpay service.

There is no additional paperwork to fill out, this is an add on to the webpay service. The only charge is $0.50 per payment made through the shopping cart, this fee will be added to your webpay service charges.

Below are instructions on how to use the cart with an example URL.

Below is a sample URL.

https://www.rtowebpay.com/Invoices/Cart.aspx?id=0B440004450301&s=2&product=RTO+Pro+Test+Shopping+Cart&price=10&qty=1&return=www.rtopro.com/prices.aspx&units=0

Below is a breakdown of the URL, the text in blue is what you would replace with your values.

https://www.rtowebpay.com/Invoices/Cart.aspx?id=0B440004450301

The URL should always start like above, replace the "0B440004450301" with your companies webpay ID, contact support to get yours.
