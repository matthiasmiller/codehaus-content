Inventory Menu Option "5"

The BOR report will show historical BOR activity between given dates. Enter the begin and end dates you wish to run by then select print or display. Remember this will only show activity for inventory that is received with BOR as yes. 

Please note if you close and re-open an agreement, if all done in the same time period of the report would show 2 rentals and 1 return for that one agreement.

If historical BOR reporting is not used by your company this feature can be turned off, [click here to see the help topic on historical BOR data.](bor_do_not_track_historical_re.md)
