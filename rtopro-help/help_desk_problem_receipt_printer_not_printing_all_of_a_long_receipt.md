Note: A common problem after setting up the Epson printer is long receipts getting cut off. This is caused by the flow control on the port being set to Xon/Xoff instead of Hardware.

To correct this do the following:

Click on Start > Settings > Printers

Click on the Epson Printer then click File > Properties

Click on the Details Tab then click on Port Settings

Change the Flow Control to "Hardware"

Click OK and OK

This will correct the problem.
