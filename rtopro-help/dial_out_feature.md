RTO Pro has a "Call Out" feature that will dial a customers number in your phone system for you. So you can click the call out button and pick up your IP desk phone or softphone and the number will be dialed for you.

This feature currently works with [Vodia](call-out-feature-vodia.md) and [RingCentral](call-out-feature-ringcentral.md) directly using their API's, or you can use the [Windows TEL Protocol](call-out-feature-using-windows.md) which is supposed to work with most if not all VOIP phone services that have a Windows phone app. 

The RingCentral service will also work with the following partner services: Atos Unity Office, Avaya Cloud Office, TELUS Business Connect, Alcatel Rainbow Office, AT&T OfficeHand, BT Cloud Work and Vodaphone Business.

Only your phone service provider can tell you if their service is compatible with any of the options above. If your phone service has a call out feature available but will not work with any of the options above have them send us details on their Click to Call, Call out, or Dial Out API and we can give you a quote on adding them as an option. An example of API information can be found on this page(this is Vodia's API): <https://api.vodia.com/click-to-call_api>

Note: The only support we provide for setting up your phone system for use with RTO Pro are the instructions in these help topics. Any other information/details would be provided by your phone service provider. The only system we have tested the Call Out feature with is RingCentral. Contact your phone service provider to find out if your service is compatible with this feature.
