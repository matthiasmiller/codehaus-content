•Dashboard was including deposits as revenue, this has been fixed.

Ver 5.9.347 6/2/2023

•The Sync TO Webpay process was not including a payment for today if the customer was exactly 1 month behind, so it would only send as if 1 payment was due if they are due 5/1 and you sync 6/1. This bug was introduced in an update the past couple of months. This is fixed. Ver 5.9.347 6/2/2023

•For Central Server companies there is now a setting to share the next stock number to use between all stores when stock numbers are auto generated.

When this box is checked instead of each store using their own folder (like "RTOwin\Docs\001\") for letters, instead the "RTOwin\Docs" root folder will be shared with all companies. The copy documents utility in Store Setup can now be used to copy to or from the root docs folder when this option is enabled, so if store 1 was has all the letters you wish to use for example for all stores you can use that utility to transfer from 1 to 0 (0 means the root directory).

After you install and run RTO Pro you will be prompted to run a utility to edit existing HTML document files to remove extra "<span>" sections that were added by the previous HTML editor. You should be sure you have done a recent update before running this process. After this update if you had any email letters that used images they will probably have to be edited to correct the images or put them back in. The previous HTML documents had issues with images, they would be lost in emails if not sent from the same computer the letter was created on, this update does not have the same issues and once a form letter is created it can be sent from any workstation and it will look the same. Ver 5.9.331 4/17/2023

•You can now use {store} field code in email letters subject. This would be replaced with the store name when the letter is generated.

•The SMS texting service has been improved so you can have multiple numbers on your account to send outgoing texts from.

We recommend if you use one number per 3000 texts per month, or if you often send a lot of mass texts at the same time you may want to consider adding additional numbers to your account.

If you have customers who want to be charged before their due date this can still be set from normal contract maintenance (point of sale menu option 3).

56.Changes have been made in the way credit card numbers are stored in RTO Pro in order to meet the new Visa regulations which take effect 7/1/2010. The actual credit card number will not be stored by RTO Pro any longer, instead when you save a credit card # it will be passed to Xcharge which will assign it a secure token. RTO Pro will store the secure token. The credit card swipe screen has been changed also, Xcharges credit card screen will now be used, this is to keep credit card numbers completely isolated from RTO Pro. These changes are very minor to the end user, no change is required in the way any of these processes are completed by the end user. If you have stored any of your customers credit card information in RTO Pro you must go into the recurring billing screen and click the button on the lower left to convert your CC#'s you have stored now to secure tokens.

So after running recurring billing verify the ACH transactions then send them to the ACH server by clicking that button on the recurring billing screen. Note you should always run the recurring billing report first to verify all transactions before running the process also. Ver 5.4.165 5-7-2010

PCI Compliance notice (payment card industry (PCI))

X-Charge is a PA-DSS validated payment application and is integrated into RTO Pro. Starting with version RTO Pro 5.5.6 our integration method isolates cardholder data from our software. By utilizing XCharge as the only module that handles cardholder data, we follow industry best practices. PA-DSS does not apply to our software because it applies only to applications that store, process or transmit cardholder data.

A few minutes later they find out the server computer was turned off but in the meantime they have messed up their path settings. Worse case scenario would be they change the "datapath" but have the correct server name which would mean RTO Pro would work but that WS would be getting many settings, files etc. from the wrong location so that WS would have different results to a lot of different operations. With this change its still possible for somebody to do that but this makes it harder.

8.The RTO Pro backup program has been optimized more for use with Windows Scheduler. Since you can do "Hot" backups with the new SQL Server database scheduling automatic backups with Windows Scheduler will be even more useful now. The backup program has been changed to do the backup without any success messages and without starting RTO Pro after the backup is finished. A good backup plan should now include automatic backups daily to a folder on the hard drive and also we recommend using an online backup service like Carbonite to backup the backup folder to the internet. [Click here for a free trial of Carbonite, it is only $49.95 a year for unlimited online backups.](http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-3255039-10571305) Ver 5.3.76

11.The database that RTO Pro uses has been changed to a SQL Server database. The change will allow users with RTO Pro Network Site Licenses to have truly unlimited number of computers accessing data simultaneously over a network. The previous database had the ability to allow unlimited users but it would start to get sharing violations with heavy use or with 5 or more simultaneous users. The SQL Server database also allows "hot" backups, which means backups can be done while the data is still being accessed by other users. Because of the differences in the way the data is connected to the user in the old database versus SQL Server some reports and functions will be slower with SQL Server and some will be faster. Reports that require a lot of different queries from many tables will be slower with SQL Server. This is due to the differences in data connections in SQL Server VS the old database. The old database would open a direct connection to the data and leave it open until the program closed. With SQL Server the connection is made to the server and only the server connects to the database, all queries are sent to the server, the server runs the query and returns the results. With SQL Server it is a true client/server connection, this eliminates data corruption due to network problems. If a remote computer is doing a transaction and the network goes down it will not cause data corruption, with the old database data loss/corruption would usually be the result when network connections were lost or workstation computers crashed while the data connection was open. With SQL Server Networks can now be setup using wireless routers (this was not recommended with the old database). Ver 5.3.30

12.NSF contracts are counted in the total contract count and overdue contract counts on customer list and overdue customer reports. If you want the numbers to not include NSF simply unselect the NSF contract type in the contract type lists on the report screen. 5.3.30

After installing this update, go into Store Setup, Security and Printer Setup, to setup the new features.

Update No. 2.2.36 7-6-98 RTO Pro Windows 95/98/NT Version

Changes in this update:

1.When you entered a Model AND Serial number manually when loading new contracts the serial # would not come up on the last screen and an error would come up when completing the contract, this is fixed. (starting with ver. 2.2.21)

2.From store setup you can now set the autolate feature to charge just one late fee when a customer has multiple contracts that are overdue.

3.Receiving of non-serialized inventory has been changed to so that it now shows an average cost, it does this by using the following equation: (current cost x current quantity) + (new cost x new quantity) / total quantity. For instance if you have 5 on hand at a cost of 8.00 and receive 10 at a cost of 12.00 the new cost would be 10.67. Also the balance box for non serialized has been changed to show the last cost, in the example above this would be 12.00.

4.Store Setup has been changed so you may select other charges and grp/ins to be taxable or not.

5.Open Retail sales can now be treated as Accounts Receivable. There is an option for you default choice for handling open sales in Store Setup. When a sale with a balance due is treated as AR the total sale amount and tax amount is recorded at the time of the sale, the total sale including tax is recorded as AR Booked, whatever is paid down is recorded as AR Paid. Subsequent payments on the contract are also recorded as AR Paid. When an open sale is not treated as AR it is handled much like a rental. The revenue and tax are recorded when payments are paid instead of when the sale is made. All revenue reports and the Deposit report program have been changed to show AR figures.

6.There have been several changes to Auto Late Fee options. You can now select to charge a late % with a minimum and maximum amount. You can select a grace period to wait before charging late fees. You can select which contract types you wish to automatically charge late fees on. You can select to charge late fees for only days your store is open or for everyday. Also you can select an option to only charge one contract late fees for customers who have multiple contracts.

7.Inventory report now shows quantity for non-serialized inventory.

8.Safeguards have been implemented to let the user know if the system date is set ahead and then set back. Setting the system date ahead and running RTO Pro, then setting the date back can cause problems with BOR reports and Auto Late fee features, as these features use dates in a sequential order to make calculations and to keep track of BOR records. When this happens you will now be told that it has been done and will be given instructions what to do. If the due date is moved way ahead and moved back you can run the Data Repair program to fix the problem.

9.Security has been changed to allow you to specify what functions need to have a name and password entered for access. Security levels for the various functions can be set at 0-5. 0 meaning no password required 1-5 meaning security level required by employee to get access (1 being the lowest level 5 the highest, an employee with a level 5 access could do all functions). There is also an area to enter names, passwords and security levels for your employees.

10.The customer listing has been changed to include an option for Open Sales only. This will print a report with all sales with a balance due.

11.Improvements have been made to speed up the startup of RTO Pro.

12.A pop up calendar icon has been added to the print contract-next due date field.

A new Internal Contract Layout Template is included with this update. This template is for printing an entire contract on plain paper. You will be asked if you want to install this file during the upgrade setup. If you have customized the internal template for your store or state or you use a preprinted contract select NO when you are asked if you want to install the new template. If you select YES the old template file will be saved as CONTRACT.BAK. The new file which is CONTRACT.DOC is located on disk 2 of this upgrade and can be manually copied at anytime if you wish to use it and do not install it during the upgrade setup.

Update No. 2.2.16 4-17-98 R.T.O. Pro Windows 95 Version

Changes in this update:

1.When you pushed F8 from pmts to see contract information sometimes the pmts paid figure would show 1 less than actually paid, this is fixed. Note: If a payment is 10.00 and 15.00 is paid it will show 1 pmt paid on this screen, this is normal because it shows the number of full pmts paid.

2.On the last update that was sent out 2.2.1 a change was made that inadvertently caused an error with the tax rate that shows up on the Sales Tax Report for transactions that were closed out from the Contract Close and Payout screen. What the error did was cause the transaction to be misreported as 0% sales tax. The tax amount was correct but it just showed up on the wrong line on the report, this is now fixed.

3.Inventory Maintenance was not allowing you to change the RTO and Retail price. This is fixed.

4.From payments when you pushed F11 to edit address etc. the home phone field was deleting when you tabbed past it. This is fixed.

5.In Printer Setup for contracts a field has been added for "How Many Copies of Contracts to Print.". This is for when contracts are printed on plain paper, you can set it to automatically print additional copies for the customer etc.

6.The template files for MS Word have been updated for better use with Word 97 and for multiple instances of the contract term on contracts.

7.Non-Serialized Inventory quantity was not being updated from Inventory Maintenance this is fixed.

8.When receiving Non-Serialized inventory that was already in your system, the invoice #, description and date received was not being updated, this is fixed.

9.In Model Master the Exit in the File menu was not working, this is fixed.

10.When you entered a Model and Serial number loading new contracts the serial # would not come up on the last screen and an error would come up when completing the contract, this is fixed. (ver. 2.2.21)

Update No. 2.2.1 3-16-98 R.T.O. Pro Windows 95 Version

Changes in this update:

1.RTO Pro is now compatible to use MS Word 97 Ver8.0 for contracts, invoices and letters.

2.The starting process has been streamlined to allow faster loading of RTO Pro.

3.Customer listing can now be done by how many months are remaining on contracts.

4.The error "Item not found in this collection" during Inventory Receiving has been fixed. This was caused from deleting or changing categories then receiving models that were set to the old category. When this happens now you will be told the category no longer exists and you must select a new category. To change the Master Model record to a new category go to Master Model / Category from Inventory Menu.

5.You can print customer mailing labels now. From the customer listing report you can select labels instead of a report. Many popular label sizes and layouts are available. You can sort customers with all the sorting capabilities of the customer listings. To print labels from the customer listing report where the Detail or Summary was you now have a Labels choice also. Select labels then push F5 select the label type you have then a preview will come up. Push the printer icon at the bottom when you are ready to print.

6.When receiving inventory after loading for one model then loading another model immediately after the RTO and Retail price boxâs would not allow you to change them, this is now fixed.

7.One contract maintenance if a customer had 10 pieces you were not able to change the rental rate on the 10th piece, this is now fixed.

8.The customer listing report was printing the model and serial without a space between them and also the customers city, state and zip, this is now fixed.

9.When a retail sale was loaded with a balance due and with 0% tax when you pulled it up in payments it was charging tax, this is fixed.

10.When you select printers in Printer Setup RTO Pro was bringing up a printer setup dialog box to select a printer. On some printer drivers the paper size that was brought up was not the current one for the printer and if the printer was selected and the paper size was not changed to the correct size it would change the settings to the wrong size. This has been corrected now RTO Pro brings up the print dialog instead of the print setup dialog so the paper size cannot be changed by mistake.

Update No. 2.1.36 2-12-98 R.T.O. Pro Windows 95 Version

Changes in this update:

1.Print Screens can now be printed from payment, contract detail and inventory detail screens by clicking on the Print Screen in the Menu bar or by pressing ALT and P at the same time.

2.There is now a separate section under Printer Setup to select the printer to print Run Sheets in the On Screen Account Manager. Before now the Run Sheets were always printed with the same printer as receipts. You can now specify which printer you want the Run Sheets to be printed to and also a font to be used.

3.You can delete Customer records now. To do this pull the customer up under payments or customer inquiry, push F11 for edit, then push F4 to delete. Note: you cannot delete a customer's record if they have any open contracts. Also when you delete a customer record the rental or retail contracts that were assigned to that account will be deleted also. This will not affect your revenue figures any revenue from these deleted contracts will still be counted when you run revenue reports. However if a deleted customer was sold something retail and they are deleted, when you run a revenue summary or sales report the sale amount will be shown but the inventory purchased will not be shown. Inventory is not deleted under any circumstances by deleting customer records.

4.For receipts and run sheets you can now select a font to use for printing if you wish. The purpose for this is to make receipts print faster. The default font is a true type font, which will print correctly on all printers however on dot matrix printers this font may print slow. To increase the speed if you have a dot matrix printer select a printer font for receipts under Print Setup. The printer fonts will have a small picture of a printer to the left of the name in the font list.

5.An error has been fixed in the Data Repair Program that came up on some data.

6.When receiving inventory before if the item was already in inventory you were given an error and not told which piece was already in inventory. With this update it has been changed, now you will be told which piece has already been loaded and you will be able to change the serial # or delete it and finish receiving the other items.

7.When you go into customer maint. from new rental or new sales the changes made to the customer record will now appear on the new rental or sale screen after updating the data.

8.The On Screen Account Manager was not listing customers 1 day late, this has been fixed.

9.The reprinting of reports was not working on some machines this is now fixed.

10.Information box's have been added to some screens to clarify how they work. Also on contract inquiry from payments the line #'s for the contract summary listing was changed to command buttons which can be clicked to bring up detail information.

11.When running billing through the On Screen Account Manager you will now be asked if the invoices printed ok. If you choose no the billed date for the contracts will not be updated so that you can rerun billing without manually changing the billed dates.

If you are using a small receipt printer you must select an alternate printer to print the Run Sheets from the On Screen Account Manager. Included with this update is also an information sheet on the Epson TM-U200 printer, which we have, available for sale. This printer uses 3" roll paper, which is inexpensive and available at just about any office supply store. A print sample is also attached. This printer prints very fast.

2.Late fee's can now be set up to charge so much per day late or per payment. Now you can select which way to charge late fee's and how much to charge for a late fee. To set this up go to the Store Setup under the Setup Menu.
