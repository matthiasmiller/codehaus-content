The Inventory Control Module (ICM) makes it easy to perform a store inventory.

When you first run the ICM you have to start a new session by clicking on "Session Control > Start a New Session". This will add all inventory that is stock to a grid. In this grid there are 2 columns that you can edit and these are the location and comments columns.

When you enter a location you are marking the inventory piece as located. The location can be a place in the store such as "back room" or you could set up some kind of location system in your store and backroom and get very detailed such as "row 3 #5".

You can also use a Metrologic ScanPal 2, Portable Collection Barcode scanner to scan barcodes to automate the entry of locations of inventory.

When you are finished with the ICM Session, click on "Session Control > Close Session". This will update the ICdate and IClocation fields in the inventory database for RTO Pro.
