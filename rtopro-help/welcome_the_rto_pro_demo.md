The Demo for RTO Pro is a full use demo, which means all functions are enabled except for the ability to change the store name.

The demo can be evaluated for a period of up to 75 days, after the evaluation period is over you can even restart the trial period again, however all data you have entered will be deleted when you do.

The trial of RTO Pro is designed so that you could actually start loading your real customers in RTO Pro and try out all features of the software before purchasing. When you purchase the software you have the option to keep all data you have already loaded.

When you first start the demo you have the option of using the demo with sample data already loaded or you can start out with empty databases and load inventory, customers etc. yourself.

When you are ready to purchase RTO Pro see [Ordering Info.](rto_pro_information_ordering_information.md)
