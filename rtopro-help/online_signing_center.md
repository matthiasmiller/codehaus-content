Shed dealers with any mobile devices or browser will be able to load agreements online, including E-signature for the customer to sign.

The workflow will be like this:

1\. At the dealers lot, the dealer or customer fills in the customer application online, through a desktop or mobile device.

2\. Dealer fills in agreement and inventory details online

3\. Agreement and customer info is instantly sent to your RTO Pro office desktop, where a PDF agreement is created.

4\. The PDF agreement is then displayed on the dealers device, where the customer can review the agreement and sign it on the mobile device.

5\. The agreement is then saved for later access and sent to the RTO Pro desktop to be saved in the customers documents.

More info on this service will be coming soon. There will be a $0.75 per agreement fee for this service. For more info or to sign up call 352-383-9375
