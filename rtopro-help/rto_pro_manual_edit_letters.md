This allows you to edit the letters that are printed via the On Screen Account Manager, payment screen, customer list form letters and overdue customer list form letters. There are 2 list boxes on this screen, one is for regular letters which are printed and edited internally with the WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) RTO Pro Word Processor. The bottom list box is for letters which are edited and printed with Microsoft Word. Note: to use the Word type letters you must have Microsoft Word installed on your computer also.

To insert a field to be filled in by RTO Pro, click on the Insert Letter Field button when you are at the spot you want to insert a field. After you are through editing or creating the letter, save it then click on the Return to RTO Pro button.
