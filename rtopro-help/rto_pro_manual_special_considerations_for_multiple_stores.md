For multiple stores there are some things that should be done to insure compatibility between the stores, some of the things to watch out for.

1\. Store #âs: Each store must have a different store #, a number between 1 and 98.

2\. Inventory FP Agent Names: The inventory FP agents nameâs must be exactly the same in every store. See Floor Plan Agent in [Terms](rto_pro_manual_terms_used_in_this_manual_and_rto_pro.md) below and also See [Receiving](rto_pro_manual_receiving.md).
