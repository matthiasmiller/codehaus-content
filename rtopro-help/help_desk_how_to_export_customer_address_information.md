RTO Pro can export customer address information for use with an external program or company, such as an advertising company creating a mailing for you. To use this function you select Labels type report from [Customer Listing](rto_pro_manual_customer_listing.md)(Customer Menu option 3). Set the other options on the report to include only the customer you want.

You can choose any label type when you are prompted to select a label. When the labels are displayed on the screen at the bottom you will see a tool bar like the one below.
