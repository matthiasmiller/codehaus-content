RTO Pro now has integrated credit card, debit card and check guarantee processing capabilities. This allows you to process the cards through your computer via modem or an Internet connection.

If you are not accepting credit cards now you can set up account with any credit card processor and use the integrated credit card capabilities in RTO Pro instead of purchasing or leasing expensive credit card terminals.

X-Chargeâ¢ Integrated Credit Card Processing Software is a valuable and cost effective solution. Listed below are just a few of our many benefits:

X-CHARGE CREDIT CARD PROCESSING BENEFITS

CURRENT WITH THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY- Security updates occur that require merchants to purchase or lease new terminals in order to remain current in technology advances. Failure to update may cost merchants higher processing costs. The X-Charge software stays in pace with these new technologies and updates are shipped to merchants. Upon receipt, merchants simply contact tech support for simple installation instructions, allowing merchants to remain current and never be subjected to higher processing costs!

ELIMINATE ERROR AND FRAUD- Using our software solutions and X-Charge requires no re-keying of sales amounts. The amount tendered in the program is exactly what is authorized via X-Charge. This integration virtually eliminates the chance for fraud or error!

STREAMLINE PROCESSES- Every credit card transaction has a corresponding transaction within X-Charge, never missed or erroneously keyed.

EXTRA COUNTERSPACE- X-Charge software runs directly on the your RTO Pro station, replacing standalone bank terminals, reducing the clutter at the checkout counter and providing more valuable space for selling.

SPEED UP PAYMENT PROCESSING- Credit Card transactions are authorized in less than 15 seconds via modem; 2 to 3 seconds using high speed Internet!

EASY TO LEARN/SIMPLE TO USE- Your clerks simply tender the sale normally and swipe the customerâs credit card - X-Charge does the rest! Your clerks do not need to move from the RTO Pro station, to the standalone terminal, back to the RTO Pro station.

INCREASE CUSTOMER SATISFACTION- No longer will you have to issue a RTO Pro System receipt and a separate credit card receipt. One receipt provides a more professional solution.

NETWORK FLEXIBILITY- Rather than having one or multiple credit card terminals and printers for a network of RTO Pro stations, X-Charge allows you to have one modem and one telephone line. X-Charge also allows you to process via High Speed Internet eliminating multiple or single phone lines.

KNOWLEDGE IS POWER- X-Charge can print meaningful management reports, allowing daily, weekly, monthly, yearly and user defined time period reporting. Much more information than stand alone credit card terminals can provide!

Applying for an Internet Certified Merchant Account is a quick and easy process.

PCI Compliance notice

X-Charge is a PA-DSS validated payment application and is integrated into RTO Pro. Starting with version RTO Pro 5.5.6 our integration method isolates cardholder data from our software. By utilizing XCharge as the only module that handles cardholder data, we follow industry best practices. PA-DSS does not apply to our software because it applies only to applications that store, process or transmit cardholder data.
