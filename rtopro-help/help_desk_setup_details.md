If you check this box and your markup is 1.2x cost and something cost 799.99, 11 months would =87.27 and 48 weeks would = 20.00. Without this box checked if you use /4.33 to get weekly pmt, 11 months would =87.27 and 48 weeks would = 20.15. NOTE: IF YOU CHECK THIS BOX WEEKLY PAYMENT RATES WILL NOT ROUND EVEN IF YOU HAVE THE BOX BELOW CHECKED.

12: Round up Weekly AND Monthly payments if you have it set to round up in category markup.
