Starting with version 5.9.17 you can export credit card tokens by following the steps below:

Go to Setup Menu > Store Information Setup > Click Help menu (top right) > Click Export credit card tokens

It will prompt to select stores to include then export the tokes to a CSV file. It will open to the folder where the file is when it is complete.
