For serial and stock numbers that are auto generated you can add a coded prefix for store number and date codes. Below are the codes you can use.

s=store number

yy=2 digit year

yyyy=4 digit year

mm= 2 digit month

dd= 2 digit day

For serial numbers you can embed other characters, such as "s-yy:mm:dd-", which would make a generated serial number of 200, for store 2, received on 2/8/2023.

2-23:02:08-200

"yyyymmdd" would make it: 20230208200

Remember serial numbers are a maximum of 30 characters!

Stock Numbers

For stock numbers since they are numbers only and do not allow alpha characters you can only do something like: "syymmdd", which for stock number 300 and the same item as above, would be

2230208300

"yyyymmdd" would make it: 20230208300

"12yyyymmdd" would make it: 1220230208300

Remember stock numbers are a maximum of 15 numbers! So any prefix plus the generated number must be 15 numbers or less.

Please note for stock numbers if there are any other string characters saved as the prefix no prefix code would be generated on receive, you can only have the following characters: "s", "yy", "yyyy", "mm", and "dd".
