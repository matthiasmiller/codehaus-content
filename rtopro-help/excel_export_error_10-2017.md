On 10/10/2017 Microsoft released a Windows security update that broke export to Excel functionality. See the help pages below for information about this. 

<https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4041681/windows-7-update-kb4041681>

<https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4041678>

Microsoft states in the "Known Issues" notes: "Microsoft is working on a resolution and will provide an update in an upcoming release."

Microsoft suggests a workaround in the documents above, however in testing we have found their workaround does not work either.

We came up with our own workaround that is included in version 5.8.741 of RTO Pro.

If you were directed to this help topic through RTO Pro then the Export to Excel function has failed, even with the workaround. Contact tech support at 352-383-9375 so we know the fix does not work for everybody. If Excel export does not work with this update your only options will be to wait for Microsoft to release an update that corrects the issue or uninstall the Windows updates mentioned above.
