When you load sales and rentals you can choose the salesman for that transaction and there are several reports that can be ran by salesman, so you can track revenue and sales by salesman.

In RTO Pro there are 2 ways you can track your salesmen, each is listed below.

1\. Employees loaded into RTO Pro as salesmen (this is the default option).

With this option any employee you add to RTO Pro would be available to choose as a salesman, unless you check the box in the employee settings that they are not a salesman. This is the most common way of handling salesmen, use this option if all or most of your salesmen are employees that you want to add into RTO Pro. You add employees into RTO Pro through Security (Setup Menu > Security).

2\. Salesmen on the fly, salesmen not attached to employee records.

With this option a salesman can be added as you load a new agreement or sale, without having to add them as an employee. This method is best if you have lots of salesmen and they are not all employees.

To use this method check the box below in Store Setup, under the main tab(the tab that is open when you first go into Store Setup). To edit your employee list when you use this method click the button in Store Setup "Edit Salesman list if not attached to employees", shown below.
