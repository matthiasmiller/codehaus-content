Run time error 24 when printing Word type letters â invoices etc.

This is usually due to copying or cutting and pasting fields. When you copy and paste a field it loses some of itâs properties, thus the error is returned when filling in that field.

All fields to be filled in by RTO Pro must be inserted by clicking on the Insert Field button in Microsoft Word.

It is recommended that the RTO Pro Word Processor be used to create all forms, letters etc. in RTO Pro, it is faster, easier to use, has almost the same functionality as Word and is included for free with RTO Pro..
