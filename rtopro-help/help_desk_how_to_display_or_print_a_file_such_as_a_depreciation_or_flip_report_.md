The last 1000 receipts and the last 10 reports ran can be viewed or reprinted from Print Utilities (F5 from Main Menu). But you can also view or print files that are saved to the hard drive on your computer for future reference, such as flip reports and depreciation reports. These reports are saved in the C:\RTOwin\flips directory (on a network system they are saved on the server computer).

To view or print a file that is not in the file list in print utilities first you have to open the viewer. From the Main Menu push F5 then Enter. This will display the last receipt. Then click on File > Open. This will open a file open dialog box, browse to the file you would like to view and double click on it. Once the file is opened you can then print it by clicking on the print button.
