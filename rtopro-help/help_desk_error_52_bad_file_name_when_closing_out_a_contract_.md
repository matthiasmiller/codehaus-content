Problem: Error 52 bad file name when closing out a contract.

Cause: This can be caused by an inventory item on the contract with no model #. In some stores that had data converted from other software to RTO Pro this has happened.

Fix: To fix pull up the inventory item in inventory maintenance. Push F12 for switchout and give it a model #.
