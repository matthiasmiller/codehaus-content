Error 1006 when printing Invoices using Word â tried to paste multiple locations.

This error comes up when a invoice is being printed with more than one contract on it. It is caused by the field "total1" not being on the contract layout file.

To correct this problem open the invoice layout from printer setup and insert the total for this contract field at the end of the first contract line.
