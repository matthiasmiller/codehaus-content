How to Manage Returned ACH Transactions:

Returned transactions are ones that have been sent and returned, because of NSF or other reason (you will not be paid for them).

When viewing ACH transactions, select the "Show Returns" bullet in the top left corner of the screen.

Select a transaction and right-click to see options. Options are as follows:

Here is a break down of your options:

1\. Returned transactions can be reversed in RTO Pro (original transaction reversed). You can perform this function from this screen so the record will be flagged as reversed, so you know it has been handled.

2\. Check if transaction was already reversed. This will look at the history records and see if it was reversed already (using the normal reverse process instead of through this screen), if it was reversed it will be flagged as reversed.

3\. Load as an NSF. You can perform this function from this screen so the record will be flagged as Loaded as NSF, so you know it has been handled. The NSF load screen will be brought up with most info filled in already.

4\. 1 Click Load as NSF. This function will load all selected returned transactions as NSF's without any further prompts. The default NSF fees will be used and no NSF letters will be printed if you use this option.

5\. Flag as already loaded as NSF. If the item was loaded as an NSF manually you can flag it as such with this option. 

6\. Flag as resubmitted through the CheckAssist ERS website (If you use Profituity as your ACH provider, see line below if you use ICheckGateway). You can resubmit a return through the ERS website for several reasons, such as a return due to wrong account number, you could log into the ERS website, correct the account number and resubmit. The Profituity ERS website is: <https://quickcheckinc.com>. You will need your user name and password Profituityt assigned you to log on.

For ICheckGateway users: At the time of this writing ICheckGateway does not have a feature to resubmit returns through their website, any resubmits would have to be done through RTO Pro by reversing the payment and reprocessing the payment by ACH or loading as NSF then paying the NSF by ACH.
