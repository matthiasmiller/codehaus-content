Problem : When using Windows XP with Word XP and you attempt to print or edit a Word type contract, letter etc. you get the following error:

Error # -2147417851

Automation error

The server threw an exception

Cause: If you have Windows XP and are planning to use Word type contracts, letters, etc. you cannot use Word XP. There is a problem with automating Word XP in Windows XP. This is not caused by a bug in RTO Pro this is a problem with Win XP and Word XP. Word XP does work correctly with previous versions of Windows (95,98,ME) and Windows XP works with previous versions of Word (97,2000). However you cannot use Win XP with Word XP if you want to be able to use the automation features in RTO Pro to print contracts etc.

Fix: This problem has been reported to Microsoft and we will report when and if there is a fix released by them.

Update 4-20-2002: We ran test on Windows XP with Word XP and the problem seems to be fixed in the latest updates to Word and or Windows. Make sure you download the latest patches to both Word and Windows and you should not have this problem anymore.
