If the stores address is formatted correctly in [Store Information Setup](rto_pro_manual_store_setup_information.md) the state your store is in will automatically be used for all new customers when loading new customer records.

The city state zip line should be formatted as follows in [Store Setup](rto_pro_manual_store_setup_information.md).

City, ST zip

Eustis, FL 32726

If you format as above FL would be used for the state for all new customers (you can change manually if the customer is in a different state.)

If you DO NOT want the state to fill in automatically format it like below (no comma after the city):

City ST Zip

Eustis FL 32726
