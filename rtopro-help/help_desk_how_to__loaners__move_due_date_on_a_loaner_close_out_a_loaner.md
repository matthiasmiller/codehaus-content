You move the due date on loaners by pulling up the customer under payments then clicking on the "Has Loaner" button, then entering in the new due date and pushing enter to save.

Loaner contracts are closed the same as a regular rent to own contract, from [Contract Close](rto_pro_manual_contract_close_and_refunds.md) (Point of Sale Menu option 4 then option 1).
