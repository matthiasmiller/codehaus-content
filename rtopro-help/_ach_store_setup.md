Step 2:

Once in the Credit Card/ACH tab, check box in row 13, shown in figure 2. This will allow you to process ACH payments through RTO Pro.

Step 3:

Enter your store's information in either the ICheckGateway or CheckAssist (a.k.a. Profituity) sections shown in figure 3, depending on which service you use. This is information that you have received via email from your ACH provider. If using ICheckGateway, make sure you also select the check box in row 17.

Note: If doing check conversions, see rows 14 and 15.
