Contract Addendum's can be printed along with agreements. They can be used for Insurance, Club or for additional Inventory addendum's. For Club or Insurance they will be printed automatically when the customer has Club or Insurance. If used for additional inventory it would be printed automatically when the contract has more inventory items on it then the contract template has spaces for.

You create Addendum's from "Printer Setup" (Setup Menu option 2) under the contracts tab. You also select what kind of Addendum you want it to be in Printer Setup.

To use this as an additional inventory addendum you would repeat the last line of inventory on your regular contract on the Addendum. For instance if your regular contract has 3 inventory item lines on it on your Addendum you would put inventory lines 3 through 10 on it.

When there are more inventory items rented than there are lines on your contract, the Addendum would be printed automatically the last inventory line item on the contract will say "See Addendum".
