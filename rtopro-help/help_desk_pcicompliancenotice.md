Credit Card processing PCI Compliance notice (payment card industry (PCI))

X-Charge is a PA-DSS validated payment application and is integrated into RTO Pro. Starting with RTO Pro version 5.5.6 our integration method isolates cardholder data from our software. By utilizing XCharge as the only module that handles cardholder data, we follow industry best practices. PA-DSS does not apply to our software because it applies only to applications that store, process or transmit cardholder data.
