# Texting a Quickpay Link

If your company uses the RTO Pro Webpay Service you can send text messages with "Quickpay" links embedded in them. This would allow your customers to click the link from the text message on their smart phone and be directed to their account on the webpay site to pay payments, without having to log in or create a login.

To use this feature simply include {WebPayLink} in your text message where you want the link to go. For instance you could have a text message worded like below:

Your account at "Your company Name" is over due, call us at "your number" or click the following link to pay online: {WebPayLink}

Remember text messages can only be 160 characters to be charged as a single text, so you should use no more than 130 in a message like this to leave space for the link that must be embedded. If the length of the text, including the quickpay link goes over 160 characters you will be charged for 2 text charges per message sent that is over 160 characters. The length of the quickpay link can vary depending on the length of the customers account number and your webpay account id. You should send some test messages with the quickpay link to see if they go over 160 characters. 

To use this feature you must be signed up to use the RTO Pro webpay service and you must enter your webpay company ID in store setup, under the other tab. Call 352-383-9375 to get your webpay company ID.
