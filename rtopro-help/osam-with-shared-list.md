When running the On Screen Account Manager (OSAM) there are 2 options, each is described below.

1 Using a local list.

This is the original method, each employee creates a list on their computer for themselves to go through. Using this method the employee (account manager) would create a list based on the customers they handle, this is typically split up by routes/zones or ratings. So if you have 4 account managers you would typically have 4 routes, one for each account manager. Each account manager would make a list for their route only and go through that list. 

This method could also be split up customers among your account managers by ratings, day late ranges, contract types or salesman. 

If you want account managers to always work with their specific group of customers, either based on routes, ratings, days overdue etc. then the local list is the option you should be using.

2\. Using a Shared List

This is the new method available starting January 2023. With a shared list 1 list is created every day that is shared by all account managers. As each account manager goes into OSAM they are assigned the next customer from the shared list. As they page through customers they are assigned the next available customer. The same customer would not be assigned to multiple account managers the same day, once a customer is assigned to an employee that customer would be skipped by other employees as they go through the list.

When using a shared list you can also press F4 to flag the customer as handled. When a customer is flagged as handled they would be skipped as you go back through your list, so it is easy to tell what customers you did not get ahold of or you still need to try to contact etc.

This method works best if you have a lot of account managers and want to easily split them up evenly. With this method all overdue customers would be split up between all account managers as they page through the list.
