It is possible to export data from RTO Pro in CSV format. This is commonly used for moving data from one software to another.

To perform the export you need to go into the security screen (Setup Menu option 5). From there click on the "Help" menu at the top right of the screen. This will open a drop down menu where you will see the export option as shown below. After the export is completed the folder will be opened that will have the CSV files in it. Please note these CSV files will contain UNENCRYPTED personal info such as social security numbers, make sure you handle the files accordingly.

There are also functions in the same menu that will unencrypt / encrypt fields that are encrypted in the database, in case you want to send somebody the actual raw data file with this data unencrypted.
