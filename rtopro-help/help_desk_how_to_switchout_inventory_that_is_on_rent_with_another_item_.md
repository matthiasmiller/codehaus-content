This explains how to switchout an inventory item that is on a contract for another item, like when an item breaks down that is on rent and you give the customer another item to replace it.

Go to Point of Sale Menu option 3 Switchout and Maintenance. Pull up the customer by putting in their name or account number. After you select the customer, the customer's first contract will be displayed, if this is not the one you need to do the switchout on push the Page Down button until you find the right contract. When the correct contract is displayed push F12 and enter a search pattern for the new item (model, serial or category). Select the new item from the list after pushing enter. Then the new item will be displayed on the screen above text boxes that ask for the new rate and the line number of the item to replace.

The rate will probably be the same as the old rate which you can see down below to the right of the old item. The line number to replace means the line # to the left of the old item which you are replacing ( 1-9 or A).

To add an item to a contract instead of switching out an item, enter the first empty line below (if there is 1 item on the contract the first empty line will be 2).

After entering the rate and the line # to replace, push Enter and the new item will be placed in the old item's place in the contract inventory list. Push Enter again to save changes.
