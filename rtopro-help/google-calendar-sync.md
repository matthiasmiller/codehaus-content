The RTO Pro Scheduler events can be linked to users Google calendars. Below is how it works.

In Scheduler click the "Calendar" menu item, then go into options, check the check box "Sync Events to Google Calendar". When you click save a browser window will open for you to enter your Google credentials and authorize the Scheduler to sync with your calendar.

The employee who performs the sync above will see all scheduler events on their Google Calendar.

In Scheduler Options you can also set up an email for each driver, if the drivers has a Google account under the email address you have for them they will see their events only in their Google Calendar.
