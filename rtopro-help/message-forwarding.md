How message forwarding works:

1\. From the store you send a message to a customer. This message is encoded with the forward to email(s) (the employee email(s) attached to that customers route).

2\. When the customer replies that reply is forwarded to the RTO Pro Mobile app of the employee(s) attached to the customer's route. The store can still retrieve the incoming messages also. [See this site for info about the RTO Pro Mobile App for employees.](http://www.rtopro.com/mobileschedule.aspx)

Requirements:

1\. [RTO Pro SMS Messaging Service](http://www.rtopro.com/smstexting.aspx)

2\. Customers must be using the [Account Messenger](http://www.rtopro.com/accountmessenger.aspx) app

3\. Check the box in Store Setup to use [RTO Pro App messaging](http://www.rtopro.com/accountmessenger.aspx) (customers will get messages by SMS if they don't have the app installed)

4\. Set up your [Customer Zones/Routes](customer-zones-_-routes.md) and attach employees emails.

5\. Employees install [RTO Pro Mobile](http://www.rtopro.com/mobileosam.aspx) app on their mobile devices.

Currently this only works with customers who are using the Account Messenger app, there are plans to enable this feature for customers who reply by SMS also.
