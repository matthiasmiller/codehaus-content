Note using MS Word for invoices and other forms is no longer recommended, it has not been tested with newer versions of Word and the internal document editor has more features.

When using MS Word to create letters, Invoices or Contracts there are no extra steps involved when it comes to printing the items. RTO Pro automatically starts Word, sends it the data to print, and instructs Word to print. This is all done invisibly to you and without any additional steps required that are different from using the internal Word Processor templates.

To setup to use Word for Contracts and Invoices see [Printer Setup](rto_pro_manual_printer_form_setup.md) To setup Word for your letters see [Edit Letters.](rto_pro_manual_edit_letters.md)

These functions are compatible with Microsoft Word 97, Word 2000 and Word 2002 or XP.

Note that Microsoft WORKS is not the same as Microsoft WORD. Some versions of Works do include Microsoft Word (Works Suite 2002 for example includes WORD 2002). It is also available to be purchased alone and as part of Microsoft Office. This is available for purchase at most stores that sell software.

Note: Using Microsoft Word forms is not recommended as the Internal Word Processor is easier and faster to use and does not require Microsoft Word to be installed on your computer. Support for Microsoft Word forms will be phased out sometime in the future.
