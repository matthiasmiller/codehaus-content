The advanced search feature can be used to find a customer when you do not know the name or account number. It allows you to search by any of the customer fields. For instance if you know the first name type it in the name field and it will return all customer with that name in the field.

You can search using multiple fields also, and you can choose to "And" or "Or" for searchâs using multiple fields.

If you put "John" in the name field and "Zephyrhills" in the city field and select "And" the search will only return records with John in the name AND Zephyrhills in the city.

If you put "John" in the name field and "Zephyrhills" in the city field and select "Or" the search will return all records with John in the name, and all records with Zephyrhills in the city.

If this box is checked the following rules will apply to the search.

1\. If anything is entered in the mailing address search field a search will be done by that field only, and the contract delivery address table will be searched also. The only fields included in the search in the delivery address table are address1 and address2.

2\. If nothing is entered in the Mailing Address field a normal search will be performed and the contract delivery address table will not be searched.

When the delivery address table is searched you will see those fields in the results as deladdress, deladdress2, delcity, delstate, and delzip.
