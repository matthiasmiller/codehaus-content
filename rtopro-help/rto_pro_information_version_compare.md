Central Server Edition subscription: 

For use on unlimited computers for multiple companies or store locations from one central server computer. This subscription permits you to use RTO Pro to run multiple companies or multiple locations with a shared database. You can only have 1 dataset with this subscription. Each company or location requires its own separate subscription.

The Central Server Edition provides a solution for typically 2 different setups, each is described below:

1\. A company that has multiple locations that wants to run all stores from 1 central server. The Central server editions permits live remote payments where any store can take a payment for any other store and can see the complete customer info when taking the payment. There are many other advantages of having a centrally located server such as the ability to use only inexpensive thin client computers at your store locations as well as much greater control over your data. The Central Server Edition also has a "Master" type account that can run reports and see data for all stores. This can be ran from the corporate office to see live results anytime.

2\. Multiple companies that are ran from one location that want to streamline their operations and combine their data to share customers and make it easier to take payments etc. When processing payments you do not have to know what company the customer has an account with, when taking payments all customers are available to select from and you are automatically loaded to the correct company when you select a customer. If a customer has accounts at multiple companies you are prompted which company you want to process for. In this format it is very easy to switch between companies from a list of your subscriptiond companies which can be brought up from any screen in RTO Pro. With this setup the customer base is shared but all revenue, options, settings etc are completely separated.

Corporate Edition / Home Office: 

RTO Pro Corporate Edition is a back office reporting solution that is meant for companies with multiple locations. The Corporate Edition of RTO Pro cannot be used to run a store, you cannot enter transactions (except you can have inventory at corporate like a warehouse). The Corporate Edition is priced based on the number of stores you have using RTO Pro. To see a complete description of how the Corporate Edition works click here.
