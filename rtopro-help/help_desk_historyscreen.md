Below is a screen shot of a sample history screen. The History screen can be viewed from Payments, Customer Inquiry or the On Screen Account Manager by pushing F12. If you want to see history for just one contract you can push F12 from the contract detail screen (F8 from Payments then click o contract you wish to see detail for). The elements of the history screen will be detailed below.

Due: This was the due date at the time the transaction was done

Nxt Due: This was the next due date after the transaction was done

Empl: The employee who processed the transaction. Note this will only be saved if the function was password protected or your system is setup for employees to log in when they start RTO Pro.

Time: The time the transaction was done.

Check#: The check number if paid by check, if paid by credit card the approval number goes here if you use Xcharge. If this field contains "NotXcharge" that means a card was not processed through the integrated card system at the time of this transaction. This is what it will contain when you choose to pay by credit card, then close the credit card entry screen, then choose the option to process the payment without charging a credit card.

Field Receipt: Field receipt number or the explanation (if entered) when a due date is moved.

For RTO Pro Webpay payments the "Field Receipt" field in payment history will be flagged as follows: 

web: = normal web payment

web:P = IVR / Phone pay payment

web:A = autopay through Webpay

web:Q = quickpay through Webpay

To print the history out you can press F12 while the history screen is displayed. When you have history displayed for a single contract and print it out more info about the contract will be printed, such as contract amount, amount paid, balance etc.
