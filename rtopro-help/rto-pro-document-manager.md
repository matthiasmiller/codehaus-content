The RTO Pro Document Manager replaces the RTO Pro Document Imaging Utility. It has the same features as document imaging but with a better user interface.

Note any scanner or imaging device you use must be WIA(Windows Image Acquisition) compatible, most Windows scanners are, some do not support multiple document scanning with WIA. Contact your scanner manufacturer for details about what is supported with your scanner.

Below are instructions on how to scan with the new Document Manager. 

When you click the "Scan" button the screen below should come up, listing your WIA compatible devices you have installed on your system. Choose the scanner you want to use and click OK.

Next the WIA interface for your scanner should come up, like below. If your scanner has flatbed and a document feeder you should be able to choose which you want to use. Set the other options as needed, then click Scan.

Below is an example with Document Feeder selected.

After you click Scan your scanner should either scan from the flatbed, or the document feeder and any scan(s) will display in the Document Manager.
