When you run the customer listing report it also checks the customers "noopen" field to verify the count is correct. This field stores the number of active contracts for a customer and is used to determine if a customer shows up when you check the box "Display active customers only" from the payment screen. So if a customer doesn't show up when you check that box from the payment screen run customer listing to correct it.
