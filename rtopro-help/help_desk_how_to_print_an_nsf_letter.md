When you [load an NSF check (Point of Sale Menu option 6)](rto_pro_manual_nsf_returned_checks.md) you can print an NSF Letter at the same time.

If you do not print one while loading or you need to print another one later you can go to the payment screen for the customer, then push F8, then click on the line number of the NSF contract or push the number of the contract ( 1, 2, 3 etc.), this will take you to the contract detail for the NSF contract where you will see a "Print NSF Letter" button. You can print a letter at any time by clicking on this button.
