Commitments is a date and optionally a time a customer commits to paying a payment. Commitments can be saved from the payment screen, customer inquiry screen and the On Screen Account Manager.

You can run reports for broken commitments, you can also exclude current commitments from some reports since they don't need to be contacted again until after their commitment date if they don't pay. Broken commitments can be seen from the Overdue Customer report and On Screen Account Manager.

A commitment is considered fulfilled when they pay enough to make the next due date past the commitment date. So if somebody is due 8/1 and they commit to pay 8/5, as long as they pay on 8/5 or before and pay enough to make the next due date > 8/5 then it is fulfilled. If they do not pay enough to catch up you should record another commitment or delete the other commitment or it would be considered a broken commitment after 8/5. It can also be considered fulfilled if they pay after 8/5 but still pay it up, so if they commit to 8/5 and pay 8/7 on 8/6 it would show as a broken commitment, after they pay on 8/7 it would no longer be a broken commitment.

For most reports once a commitment is broken it is considered a broken commitment forever if the customer doesn't pay again. For instance if a customer is due 8/1/2022 and commits to pay 8/5/2022, then never pays again it would be considered a broken commitment.

There is no need to un-check the commitment box when a customer pays, a commitment date is only valid if it is after the current due date, so if there is a commitment for 5/1/2022 and their due date is 6/1/2022 that commitment is no longer active or broken.
