The first screen that comes up when you go to the payment screen is the customer selection screen. This screen has boxes to type in either customerâs name, account #, social security number or contract # to find the desired customer. There is also an advanced search button that will display a search screen where you can search by address, alternate name, phone number and many other fields. When entering customerâs name in the customer selection screen put last name first. It is not necessary to type in full name or even the full last name you can just type a few letters of their last name. After you have a name or account# typed in push ENTER and the customer list screen will display with customers listed alphabetically based on what you entered to search by (unless you enter account, contract or SS# then the matching customer will just display on the payment screen). 

After selecting the customer from the list the Payment Screen will come up. The cursor will be at the grand total box, you can enter the amount being paid here or just push F6 to complete if the amount being paid is correct. You can also enter a total for each contract in the contract total lines for customers with multiple agreements, or enter the number of payments to pay or enter a next due date to pay through, in any case always verify the grand total is what the customer is paying and push F6 to continue to the "Tendered" screen where you enter the payment form (cash, check etc.) then complete the payment transaction.

To change the other amount manually push F4 and you will be able to change the other amount on each contract. Note: When you remove late fees and take a payment the other amount will show due the next time you pull up that customer. To permanently remove a late fee you can remove it from the payment screen, take the payment, then remove the other charge from other field in contract maintenance. Note the other due field in contract maintenance only displays previous unpaid other charges, not current late fees.

Total: For each contract there is a "Total" text box. This will display the total currently due for each contract. You can edit this amount if the customer is paying more or less than the amount initially displayed.
