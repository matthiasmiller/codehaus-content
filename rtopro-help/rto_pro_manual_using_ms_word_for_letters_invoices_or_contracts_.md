Note using MS Word for invoices and other forms is no longer recommended, it has not been tested with newer versions of Word and the internal document editor has more features.

When using MS Word to create letters, Invoices, or Contracts there are no extra steps involved when it comes to printing the items. RTO Pro automatically starts Word, sends it the data to print, and instructs Word to print. This is all done invisibly to you and without any additional steps required.

Microsoft Word is not required to print any forms in RTO Pro. All forms and documents in RTO Pro can be edited and printed with the RTO Pro Word Processor. It is recommended that you use the RTO Pro Word Processor to create all documents in RTO Pro as it is faster and easier to use and has almost all of the functionality that Word has.

These functions are compatible with Microsoft Word versions 6.0, Word 95, Word 97, Word 2000 and Word 2002.
