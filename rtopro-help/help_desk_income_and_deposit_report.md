The End of Day report program is included with RTO Pro. This program allows you to enter your bank deposit amount(s), credit card amount received and any cash paid out of drawer. It will tell you if you are short or over for the day. What you enter for your deposits here should match what you actually are depositing at your bank, this makes it easy to reconcile against your bank statements.

This program will also print out a report and save a file to disk with the same information. The file will be named the first 4 letters of your city with an extension of .inc. Example if your store is in Orlando the file would be named "orla.inc".

The printed report or the file should be given to the stores accountant or the person who tracks your stores checking account. With the figures from this report the necessary entries can be made into whatever accounting system your are using.

Quickbooks IIF Files

The End of Day can also create IIF files that can be imported into Quickbooks and other accounting software. [For additional information about IIF files and importing into Quickbooks click here.](help_desk_quickbooks_or_other_accounting_software_integration.md)

5\. There is a place to enter any comments.
