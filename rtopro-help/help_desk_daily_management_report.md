If we rent an item for 19.99 a week plus tax and LDWâ¦.this is the rent only---19.99 GWRR GWRR is calculated as follows all active agreements are counted, monthly agreements payment is divided by 4 to get weekly rate, bi-weekly and semi-monthly are divided by 2 to get weekly rate.

Database Information Section

This is contract count for deliveries, pick ups, paid off, write off and cancelled, by day, week and month. The % is the number divided by AOR to get % of AOR. This includes R, L, T, G and O type accounts.

WTD is always the target dates week, for this report the week starts on Sunday and ends Saturday, even if they are not in the same month. So if you run the report for Wednesday 4/3/2024 WTD would be Sunday 3/31/2024 to Wednesday 4/3/2024.

Please note cancelled contracts can throw off totals when comparing these reports over time. For instance if you load an agreement on Wednesday and run this report it would show 1 for deliveries. Then Thursday if you load another agreement, but cancel the one from Wednesday, Thursday's report will show 1 delivery, 1 cancel. Comparing the report for the 2 days it would look as if the total delivery count should be 2, since Wednesday shows 1 and Thursday's report show 1, but it will only show 1 on Thursday for WTD because of the cancel. Cancelled total was added to this report to help with auditing the numbers and to help track cancels. Also note that a contract that was printed, but never loaded is included is this cancelled number also, those were never included in the Deliveries number.
