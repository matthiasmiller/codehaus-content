List screens are used throughout RTO Pro, they are a list of customers, inventory etc. To select one from the list use the arrow up or down keys to highlight the selection you want and then push ENTER or just push the character to the left of the selection you want. When you push the character to the left of youâre selection (1,2,3 etc.) you do not need to push ENTER. You can click on your selection with the mouse to select also.
