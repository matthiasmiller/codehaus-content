Inventory Menu Option "3"

This is to edit the master model or category records.

The master model is the default information used for a model when it is being received. To edit a model record you enter the model or part of it and select from the drop down list then push ENTER. Make whatever changes you wish to make and push ENTER to save. To delete a master model record push F4.

Note: Changing the master model does not change any of the inventory already received it simply changes the default settings when receiving new inventory with that model.

To change a category select the category from the list and push Enter. The next screen comes up where you can enter any changes to the category name. Push F12 to save changes. You will then be asked if you want all inventory with the old name changed to the new name. If you select no you will be prompted for which category you want the old inventory put into instead of the new one.
