Problem: Run Time Error 13 Type Mismatch when pulling up a customer under payments.

Cause: Incorrect setting for automatic charging of late fees could cause this.

Fix: Check the setting under the late fee tab in Store Setup. Try setting late fees to none then pull up the customer. This error has been reported when a "%" sign is saved in the late fee by percentage per payment field. Like "5%" being entered instead of just "5".
