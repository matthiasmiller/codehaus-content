If you use the RTO Pro webpay service you can email or text quickpay links to your customers. A quickpay link is a link the customer can click on to pay by webpay without having to log into the webpay system.

To text a quickpay link simply include {WebPayLink} in your text message where you want the link to go. For instance you could have a text message worded like below:

Your account at "Your company Name" is over due, call us at "your number" or click the following link to pay online: {WebPayLink} 

[See the help topic here for more info on texting a quickpay link.](fields_text_messaging.md "text")

To email a quickpay link in an invoice you add the link to the email portion of invoices, you edit these forms as shown below.
