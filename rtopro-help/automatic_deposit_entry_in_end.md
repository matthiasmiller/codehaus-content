A note about the credit card deposit amounts that are entered automatically in the end of day. 

These are entered for your convenience from the records provided by your credit card processor and other records, such as webpay payments. This can be turned off in settings so the deposits are not entered automatically for you. These are not always accurate, for instance if you process a credit card webpay payment, then reverse it and re-enter it, the system will not know to add that amount to the credit card deposit. Always verify this deposit amount is correct. 

Below is how it is calculated.

Credit card deposit = total LOCAL CC charges as provided by your credit card provider for the day + any webpay credit card payments processed. 

Webpay CC payments processed could include payments paid previous days through the webpay system (paid online after you close and not processed until the next day).
