Customer Menu Option "2"

This is to run a report to show overdue customers and you can also show closed accounts with a balance due. For an alternative to running a late list to call and run overdue customers See [On Screen Account Manager](rto_pro_manual_on_screen_account_manager.md).

Overdue Date:  Todayâs date is the default this would include anyone that is due today and before.

Open Accounts or Closed With Balance Due: Open is the default. Use the space bar or any key to put an X in the box for the type you want to run or you can do both types by putting an X in both boxes.

Detail or Summary or Labels: Detail will show all the customer information, Summary will only give you the last page of the report with the summary information on it. Labels will print labels for all the customers that would be included in the report.

By Name or Latest: This is for the sort order for the report, by name alphabetically or by latest with the latest customers first. The default is by name, to change this push the space bar or any key when the focus is on this box.

Contract Types to Include in Report: Select the contract types to include, by default it will include all contract types.

Zone: If you want the report to be for just 1 zone enter the zone here. You have to have zones enabled in Store Setup for this option be displayed. Zones can be used to separate customers into different areas for different account managers or for any other reason you need to separate customers into groups. Leaving this blank will make the report include all zones.

Salesman: If you want the report to include contracts from only 1 salesman enter the salesman name here. Leaving this blank will make the report include all salesman.

Runsheet Type Report: This will format the report like runsheets. A runsheet shows more info for each customer such as a short history. A runsheet type report will only put no more than 2 customers on 1 page.

Skip with Current Commitment: Checking this box will cause the report to skip anybody who has a current commitment.

Print More Comments: Checking this box will make the customers "More Comments" print on the report.

Print separating line between customers: Checking this box will format the report with a separating line ----------------------- between customers, making the report easier to read.

Â¨ Print Form Letter below instead of report: This option will send a form letter to everyone who would be on the report according to the options you set. You can select letter(s) to use by clicking the link(s) below the check box. If there is already a file name in the box you can click on it to select a different file. This can be used to print form letters or to Email form letters. When you click on the "Select" button you will see the letter screen where there are 2 sets of letters each has their own tab, "Letters to Print" and "Letters to Email". Select the correct tab to print or email then select the letter you wish to use.

There are 2 places you can select files, the purpose of this is to allow you to choose 1 .HTM file to email and a .RTF file to print, when you select 2 files like that anybody with an email address on file would be emailed the .HTM file, anybody with no email on file would be printed the .RTF file. The 2 files can be in any order, it doesn't matter which is the top or bottom. Note if you select 2 .HTM or 2 .RTF files the 2nd file will be ignored and only the top one would be printed or emailed.

Run by range of dates: Check this box if you want to run a report of customers due between a date range. You will be able to enter the date range after checking this box.

Broken Commitment Report: Checking this box will make the report include only customers with a broken commitment.

Scheduled Pick Up Report: Checking this box will make the report include only customers who are scheduled to be picked up.

First Payment Defaults: Checking this box will make the report include only customers who have defaulted on their first payment.

On this report 1st payment defaults are determined as follows.

For a weekly account if due date - contract date < 11 or amt. paid = or less than 1 payment they are considered 1st payment default.

For a monthly account if due date - contract date < 46 or amt. paid = or less than 1 payment they are considered 1st payment default.

For a semi-monthly bi-weekly account if due date - contract date < 22 or amt. paid = or less than 1 payment they are considered 1st payment default.

An example for 1st payment default: If a weekly agreement started on 1-1-2009 was due on 1-8-2009 they would be 1st payment default on 1-9-2009. If the agreement started on 1-1-2009 and the current due date is 1-12-2009 they would be 1st payment default 1-13-2009 if they have only paid 1 payment or less.

After all options are set the way you want them push F5 to begin the report.
