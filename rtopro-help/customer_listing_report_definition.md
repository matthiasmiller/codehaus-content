Below are the definitions for the highlighted sections on the sample report below.

(1). Total number of accounts in report. An account represents a customer, one customer can have several agreements or contracts but will only have 1 account.

(2). Total number of contracts in report. This is the number of contracts included in the report, a customer or account can have multiple contracts so this number will not always match the number of accounts.

(3). Total of items on BOR in report. This is the number of items flagged as BOR that are included in the report.

(4). Type of contract or agreement. This reports breaks down the numbers by agreement type so you can see how you are doing in each type of contract.

(5). Total number of contracts in each agreement type.

(6). Total of contract amounts in each agreement type, not including tax.

(7). Total of contract balances due in each agreement type, not including tax.

(8). Projected monthly revenue for each agreement type, not including tax.

(10). Totals for contract amounts, contract balances, and projected monthly revenue overall.

(11). Total Early Payoff amount for Rent to Own contracts, including tax but no other charges, and including tax and including other charges. This is the total you would receive if all contracts were payed off today.

(12). Total store equity Rent to Own contracts. This is the total Rent to Own balance x Early Payoff Pay percentage with no taxes or other charges included. This only applies when EPO method is set at Balance - discount = EPO. This is similar to EPO except it does not take into account late customers, customers who are paid ahead or any other adjustments that are made for the EPO, it just uses this calculation: "balance x Early Payoff Pay percentage". This does not include tax or any other charges.

(13). Total deposits for all customers in system, and total deposits for customers in this report. These amounts can be different for instance if you run the report for open agreements only and have non-active customers who have a deposit balance.
