The Windows TEL Protocol should be able to be used with any VOIP phone system to use the Call Out feature in RTO Pro. The Call Out feature will initiate a call through your phone systems phone app that you have installed in Windows, it should be compatible with all phone apps, if it does not work with your phone system contact your phone service provider to see if they have a solution that works with Windows TEL Protocol.

Note: The only support we provide for setting up your phone system for use with RTO Pro are the instructions in these help topics. Any other information/details would be provided by your phone service provider. The only system we have tested the Call Out feature using Windows TEL Protocol is RingCentral. Contact your phone service provider to find out if your service is compatible with this feature.

These instructions would have to be followed on each workstation, for every employee that wants to use the Call Out feature.

When you click Call Out from a customer screen in RTO Pro you will either get the screen below, or the "Select your phone provider" screen. If the screen below comes up click the link at the bottom to get to the provider setup screen.

If this screen does not open the app you have previously set to handle TEL Protocol on this computer will open. If you need to change the default app for the TEL Protocol you change that in Windows Settings > Default App > Choose default apps by protocol.
