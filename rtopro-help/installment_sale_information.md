RTO Pro can handle installment sales, but it is not feature complete for installment sales.

You can print installment agreements through RTO Pro, it can track payment, interest etc. but the only option for calculating early payoff in RTO Pro is using the "Rule of 78's". 

Also if an installment agreement is defaulted and the merchandise is repossessed RTO Pro does not handle the revenue adjustment. For installment sales all revenue is booked the day of the sale, payments paid are accounts receivable paid. So for defaults revenue would have to be adjusted manually for the unpaid portion of the loan.
