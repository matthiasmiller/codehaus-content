Remote desktop

Remote Desktop is included with all Windows computers, although if you remote into a non Server version of Windows with remote desktop the local user cannot use the computer while you are remoted in, with Windows Server you can remote in without interrupting the local user, also multiple users could remote into a server at the same time and have their own desktop. Often setting up remote desktop will require you to hire a local tech to set it up for you.

The link below explains how to configure remote desktop, or just search on Google for "configure remote desktop".

Remote Access Software

Remote access software such as www.gotomypc.com, www.teamviewer.com or www.showmypc.com can be used to access a computer remotely also, although these methods are not free (they may have free trials or free demo's, see their website for more info). Like remoting into a non server version of Windows with Remote Desktop when you use any of these software products to remote in the local user will be interrupted while you are accessing the computer.
