There are 2 places where a due date can be changed. The 2 are described in detail below.

From Payment Screen: From the payment screen select the customer that needs to have their due date moved. Press F11 twice. (Press once for Customer Maintenance, this allows you to make address updates, phone number updates, change of directions and to make corrections on customers names if they were typed incorrectly.) After pressing F11 twice a box containing the due date, other due and GRP amount will come up. If you want the customers due date moved up, but still require them to pay a fee you can enter it in the other due box.

From Contract Maintenance: From the Main Menu you select Point of Sale then select #3, Switch-out/Maintenance. Select the customer that needs to have their due date changed and press F11. From this screen you can change selections such as; contract type, payment terms, total number of payments, payment amount, contract amount, GRP amount, Billed, last billed, number of payments for multiple payment contracts, tax rate, current due date and other charges due.
