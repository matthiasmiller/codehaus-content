Form letters can be sent from the overdue customer list and the [customer listing report](rto_pro_manual_customer_listing.md) (Customer Menu options 2 and 3). When setting up the report, there is a line that says "Print or email form letter below". Check that box and either click on the Create/Edit or Select button to set the form letter to use. To begin printing or emailing, hit F5 or Begin Report. Instead of running the report, this option will either print a form letter with customer's name and address filled for each customer who would be on the list according to the options you set, or it will email a form letter to everyone included in the report who has an email address saved.

If there is already a file name in the box you can click on Create/Edit to edit it.

The printed letters will have the customers name and address printed on them ready to be put in a window envelope for mailing.
