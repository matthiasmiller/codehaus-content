Bonus Bucks Users

Below is an explanation of how the rental and retail income is calculated for the graphs if you use Bonus Bucks.

Rental Income on graph: #2 in the image below minus #1, minus BB Spent (Total Rental - (Rental tax + BB Spent))

Retail Income on graph: #4 in the image below minus #3 (Total Retail - Retail tax)

Total Income on graph: #6 in the image below minus #5, minus BB Spent (Total Revenue - (Total tax + BB Spent))

If you use Bonus Bucks these figures are not 100% accurate for revenue figures and should not be used for accounting purposes. Calculating revenue when you use Bonus Bucks requires adjustments to all revenue fields and tax, this report does not make those adjustments individually and instead removes all bonus bucks spent from revenue,, none from tax. The Dashboard graphs should only be used as a comparison tool, not accounting purposes.
