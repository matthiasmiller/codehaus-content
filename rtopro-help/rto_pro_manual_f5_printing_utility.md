F5 from Main Menu or Main Menu Option "5" Setup Option "3"

This utility allows you to reprint or view receipts or reports that have been run. The last 999 receipts and the last 10 reports are kept so that they can be viewed or printed. Depreciation reports can also be reprinted from here, the depreciation reports are in the list on the right hand side.

The list shows the receipts and reports in order from the newest to the oldest (except the depreciation reports). To select use the Arrow Keys and the Tab key to switch between receipts and reports. Once the one you want is selected push ENTER to view or F5 to print. If you push F5 for a report you will be prompted if you want to print all or part. You can finish a report that was interrupted by selecting it then click on the "Print Range" button and enter the page range you wish to print.
