This function will transfer a contract from one customer account into another.

The first step is to make sure the new customer has an account in RTO Pro and get the account number. If they do not have an account you can add one for them by going into Point of Sale Menu option 1 or 2, then push F5 and enter their information, save it, write down their account number then exit.

After you have the account number of the new customer for the contract go into Contract Maintenance (Point of Sale Menu option 3). Then pull up the old customer, if the contract that comes up is not the one you want to assign to someone else hit page down until the correct contract is on the screen. After the contract to re-assign is on the screen click on "Assign to Another Account" or push ALT-A. You will then be prompted to enter the new account number. After entering the number the contract and history will be assigned to the new customer.
