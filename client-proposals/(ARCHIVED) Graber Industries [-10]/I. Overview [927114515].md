1\. Overview

  


Requirements

Gra-Rock and K Graber Construction are both using QuickBooks on Mac. There are a few challenges with this:

  


  * Gra-Rock also uses Concrete Rhino. When it exports information to QuickBooks, it's impossible to make modifications in either system.
  * QuickBooks isn't supported natively on Mac. It has a lot of glitches and doesn't support multiple users.



  


To streamline operations, it would be really nice to:

  * Be able to make changes to concrete invoices before billing them out.
  * Be able to add additional users at marginal cost



  


Gra-Rock is much more basic--handling invoicing and employee details.  K Graber construction requires some additional features, which is discussed in "future enhancements".
