1.1. Parties Involved

There are various parties involved with different aspects of the logging work and the software: 

  


  * Eby Sawmill: Purchases, exports, and mills logs. 
  * Landowner: An individual or organization who owns a piece of property (Timber Tract) and sells logging rights to Eby's. A Tract can be owned by one or multiple owners. 
  * Forester: A specialist who reviews a Tract and puts together an estimate (Prospectus) of the logs contained on the Tract, including quality and board footage. Not all Tracts have a Prospectus, but when there is a Prospectus, Eby's uses it as a reference for how much they will pay for the logging rights. 
  * Logger: An individual or company contracted by Eby's to cut timber on a Tract. 
  * Vendor: An individual or company who brings logs to sell to Eby's. 
  * Customer: A company that works as a broker between buyers (usually overseas) and Eby's for exported logs.
