6.8.3. Payment Summary Reports

  


Requirements

The Payment Summary reports are based off of the Master Payments Report, and show only Paid Payments, with the corresponding breakdown of the itemization (Yard Tallies, Pulpwood Loads, etc.).

  


Edits cannot be made to Paid Payments, so these reports will not allow edits to be made.
