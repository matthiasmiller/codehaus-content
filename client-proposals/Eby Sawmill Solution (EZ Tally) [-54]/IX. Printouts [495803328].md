9\. Printouts

  


Requirements

The EZ Tally Solution generates various printouts.

  


"Basic" printouts often can be generated from the Advanced menu of a report. Note that the PDF versions of such printouts are branded with the Eby's logo and contact information but do not have any additional special customizations. Basic Excel files do not include the logo/branding.

  


"Customized" printouts are provided for various reports and/or records. CodeCrafters will take some liberty with the design of these printouts to simplify development and to compensate for technical limitations. Customized PDFs include an Eby Sawmill letterhead, and customized Excel printout/files can include the logo.

  


Other Notes: 

  * Note that names of individuals should be displayed on printouts in the following format: "FirstName LastName" (excluding Middle).
