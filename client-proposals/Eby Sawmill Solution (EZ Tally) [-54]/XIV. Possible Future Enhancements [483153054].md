14\. Possible Future Enhancements

The following options may be considered for future phases:

  


  * Gantt interface for reporting on Tract contracts



  


  * QuickBooks integration for payments



  


  * Map integration to pin tracts and to view nearby tracts
    * For the map integration, the ideal approach would be to enter an address or place a pin on the map. Then, it would extrapolate which county the tract is located in. The map could display all jobs in that area, making it easy to find tracts that are nearby.
    * This is useful because some buyers are concerned about timber not coming from an area with a conservation effort or with endangered species. The USDA also uses this information for tracking bugs and diseases, such as for the spotted lantern fly.



  


  * Users using a shared device could use a shared user account that requires the scaler to enter a PIN so that all changes can be tracked to that scaler. This will not be implemented in the initial phase and will only be implemented if a shared device is required.



  


  * A voice entry system could be developed for data entry in the yard/on the field. The lightest-weight approach may be to have a call-in number that uses voice recognition.
