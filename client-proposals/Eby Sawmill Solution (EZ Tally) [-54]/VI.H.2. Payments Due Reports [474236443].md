6.8.2. Payments Due Reports

  


Requirements

The Payments Due Reports are based off of the Master Payments Report. This report includes unpaid Payments per the selected filters, as well as Paid Payments that were marked as Paid on the current day. It also shows the corresponding breakdown of the itemization (Yard Tallies, Pulpwood Loads, etc.).

  


The user can mark unpaid Payments as Paid from this report by entering a check number and other information. Edits made on this report will be saved automatically to the corresponding Payment record when the user clicks to a different row of the report. 

  


Note that the Payment row will remain on the report until the report screen is refreshed; at that point the Payment will move to the Paid grouping if the Payment Date was set to the current day, or it will disappear from the report if the Payment Date was set to a previous day. 

  


Also note that Payment rows will remain in the Unpaid grouping even after they have been marked as Paid until the report screen is refreshed.

  


Other Notes: 

  * Note that "unpaid" refers to both "Open Unpaid" and "Locked Unpaid".
