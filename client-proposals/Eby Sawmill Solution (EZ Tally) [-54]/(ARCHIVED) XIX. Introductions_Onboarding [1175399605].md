DONE_TR - Clean up this section

Tim Reitz 08/30/2022: DONE_CH: See question below for DM about project name.

DONE_NM: Archive this section once we have that information and have it documented.

  


[X] Introductions: 

  * CodeHaus / CH design team: 
    * Matthias
    * CSS (Tim) 
    * Assistant (Niccolas)
  * General intro to AppHosting ecosystem: 
    * CodeCrafters
    * CodeHaus
    * AppHosting
  * Client & company: 
    * We love getting feedback on our ads. How did you hear about us and what prompted you to reach out?
      * : Document the response - maybe on a field on the original Sales Opportunity
        * Matthias Miller 08/09/2022: They've been fighting with software companies in the lgoging industry, trying to find somerthing that would work for them. Havne't been able to do that. They started to pursue finding someone
        * \-- brother-in-law - Justin Ebersole -- Olive Tree Studios, now Craft & Cloud (?)-  worked with software comapny in india, asked him about developing something, and he was the one who recommend CCI from the start -- then they discovered through Donald and Arnold connections in BD
        * Checked out our webiste -- what it looks like the AppHosting platform works as, is very close to what some of their goals of an app that would work for them, that's where the pieces would make sense, and they said they'd
    * What does your company do? 
      * Good summary
      *     * What is the history of the company? 
      * Started in 1988 -- Durrel (older) business - son #5, 7 boys in the family, and 5 of them are involved in the mill here -- his oldest brother Leo and 2nd oldest Anrold
      * Started in the backside of his dad's dairy barn -- just small mill
      * Basically, as their little brothers got older andwanted a job, they were the closest business to get a job. They all migrated into the mill.
      * The whole thing burnt down in 98, and rebuilt in 99, and after that in 2001 they took the 3 younger brothers into the partnership with them.
      * Dad's now a % in the business, and there are 6 partners in the business - primarily they each have their little segment they work in
      * Oldest bro Leo - in charge of purchasing standing timber, and the timber that comes into the yard -- even if they might purchase a plot of tress standing, when they bring them in, grade, measure, etc them, just as if they purchased it -- sometimes through sealed bids, private negotiaton iwh the owner, then a share basis, based on a percentage to the land owner. On all those tracts of lumber, like to follow through with their harvesting, trucking, so they can do P&L on each piece of lumber
      * Arnold does a lot in the trucking side
      * Conrad - does mulch products from waste
      * Brother - Loellen (?) - lumber sales
      * If they do remarketing as logs, Durrel does that and oversees accounting. His role is overseeing the process, and involved in the backside, and a lot of this project is going to be tied into timber and log securement on the front side of things and behing able to track that data
      * David is the office manager, paying bills, making sure everything is flowing smoothly, tracking data with log purchases, logger bringing logs, adn them bringing timber. Created a spreadsheet for each job where they've bought tsanding timber that helps track data. BVoth of them are involved in that data, after it's been input. Leo would be the one inputting it (container logs may vary).
      * Will definitely bring Leo's input into the project in the workflow for inputting. Most of the apps that they've tried -- the inputting is not the problem, the challenge is running good reports.
      * Probably processing at 12MM board feet of logs per year -- 15-20 truck
      * Actual data points of logs entered per day -- 400-850 logs per day
    * What are the branches/divisions? 
      * It all functions under the same business -- the mulch is simply a byproduct of the sawmill, but in the scope of what they're talking it's irrelevant -- also make wood pellets, and it's a byproduct -- don't purchase sawdust
      * the more efficient they run their sawmill, the les byproducts, and the side things go away
      * The only reason they need to go back for something -- they don't tag their logs, because of the effort and expense that it takes -- then it just rescales them when they put them together for export, that way they're identifiable for export -- sometimes it goes oversees and they see something's missing.



  


Two priorities:

  * Ground ZERO - when a load of logs comes in from an outside vendor, they cut the vendor and bring it to him, they need to look at each log there, and in a sense create an invoice, there are quite a few variables per log (species, diameter, and length) and the others refer to a chart. It's not a simple volume calculation -- for a board footage. Then you give it a grade based on the quality, and that determines the price off the price sheet. You do that for every single log on the load.
    * The loads that are coming from a tract that they own, this needs to be handled differently
    * It needs to be paid, etc
  * Reporting
  * Efficiency of data entry



  


  * Wanting something that's not jsut the catch-all and average --



  


[X] Gameplan: 

  * We’ve already gone over notes from your previous communication with Ian and laid out some initial notes and questions. 
  * Overview of High-Level Design: 
    * Calls with client, led by Matthias
    * Followup by CH
    * Review of document by client
    * Review by CCI, with feedback and ballpark price estimate
    * CH then shares the price for the In-Depth Design & ballpark price estimate
    * Opportunity to proceed with the In-Depth Design
  * Overview of In-Depth Design: 
    * Calls with client, led by CSS
    * "Deep dive" into the details to flesh out the ID Design skeleton
    * Review of proposal by CH and by client
    * Review by CCI, with a set price for development and monthly maintenance/support costs
    * CH shares the following with the client: 
      * Proposal: The written text of the blueprint for the software solution.  
      * Mockups: PDF document with screenshots of the mocked-up pages as a visual. 
      * Quote: A fixed-price estimate, with multiple options for payment and subscription type. 
    * Opportunity to proceed with development



  


[X] Kolbe overview: 

  * Intro/explanation of the Kolbe
    * No right or wrong answers
    * Three Parts of the Mind
    * 4 action modes -- either initiate or react (information, structure, risk, and tangibles)
    * We each have an instinct for taking action.
  * Results: 
    * Client's results
    * CSS/design team results 
    * Comparisons (client to Matthias, client to CSS) 
      * One presentation for both David and Durell: [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VePt2ISm9WPEGDO0VY7MHctTCLbe7EtI7c5H3fm8Das/edit#slide=id.g1437814401a_1_5](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VePt2ISm9WPEGDO0VY7MHctTCLbe7EtI7c5H3fm8Das/edit#slide=id.g1437814401a_1_5)
        * Tim Reitz 08/10/2022: DONE_NM: Would you put this link in the HLD incident Intro section (there's a line for Kolbe comparison link). Thanks! 
  * Any questions? 



  


"Housekeeping items": 

[X] Does Client want call summaries on a Google Doc?

[X] If yes, the CSS or Design Assistant should share it with the group

Matthias Miller 08/09/2022: Yes, have a chance to glance over it, and give Durrel a chance to glance over it. It was helpful to see that what was written in the call summary, was very close to what they were trying to describe. Well

Tim Reitz 08/10/2022: DONE_NM: Nic, could you take care of putting this together using the doc we set up ([https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BMoq62laOvrQ9mg6_u0am-z8kE1RG5NTgXpKXcrylK0/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BMoq62laOvrQ9mg6_u0am-z8kE1RG5NTgXpKXcrylK0/edit))?

You can refer to the following for examples:

  * [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UQhLuFk1oCCZg9Q6CqRFq7pbozaC5PCppSOrDN-V8zE/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UQhLuFk1oCCZg9Q6CqRFq7pbozaC5PCppSOrDN-V8zE/edit)
  * [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1STpC68r1reWRO0-M07hI5ag-AlzvkFlpMfJ56jt_UFU/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1STpC68r1reWRO0-M07hI5ag-AlzvkFlpMfJ56jt_UFU/edit)



Basically looking for a high-level summary of what we talked about (you could use the outline here in this Introductions section as a base).

Then you can share it with David and Durell, and see if you're able to paste it into the calendar events that include the clients (not sure if permissions will let you).

Let me know if you have any questions! Thanks!

 

Project name/subdomain: 

[X] Determine the project name/subdomain (helpful for shorthand reference in the design phase; possibly used the same for reference longer-term)

  * We like to have an internal name to refer to the project. 
    * Choosing this name does not signify any commitment from either side. 
    * For consistency, we like to use the website address where your software solution would be hosting. 
    * The format is something.apphosting.zone. 
    * Sometimes it is: 
      * Simply the name of the business. 
      * The acronym of the business name. 
      * A name that you choose to assign to the software solution.
    * We're looking for something that is short, unique, memorable, and relevant. 
  * Share suggestions prepared as options or conversation starters: 
    * Project name/nickname (could be just the business name): 
      * Eby's
      * escale
      * escaler
      * EZTally
      * >>> EZTally
      * YardDog
      * YardLink
      *     * Subdomain:
      * ebys.apphosting
      * >>>eztally.apphosting.zone
    * 3LC: DONE_CH: 
      * ZEB
      * ZEZ
      * >>>> ZET



  


  


Project Name: EZTally

Subdomain: eztally.apphosting.zone 

3LC: ZET

  


  * Settled on: 
    * Tim Reitz 08/10/2022: The clients wanted to consider this and get back to us. They use "Eby's" for a lot of things, and it sounded like they'd like to see about having a name that's a bit more unique for this. 



[X] DONE_DM: Any ideas yet?

  * Like the E - Electronic / Eby
  * 


[X] DONE_NM: Document in Dev Specs of the "Overview" section of this proposal

[X] DONE_NM: Update the title of the HLD incident (if needed) and document in the HLD incident
