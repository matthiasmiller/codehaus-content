11\. EZ Tally Yard App

  


Requirements

A separate interface for the EZ Tally Solution (referred to as the "Yard App") allows for the data entry entry on Yard Tallies and Export Tallies to be run on a mobile device. 

  


If needed, additional customizations/changes could be made in the future to accommodate the Juniper Systems Allegro 3 device.
