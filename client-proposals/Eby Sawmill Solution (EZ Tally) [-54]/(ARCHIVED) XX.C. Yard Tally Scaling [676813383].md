20.3. Yard Tally Scaling

General notes regarding the Yard Tally side of the app:

  


Yard Tally information:

  * Tract-Based vs Vendor-Based
  * If Tract-Based, which Tract?
  * If the Tract has multiple loggers, prompt for which logger.
  * If Vendor-Based, which Vendor?
    * Need to be able to add a new vendor to the list, with contact information. Wants to be able to email a tally right out of the software. Start typing, then you see the suggestions based on starting to type. Need a possibility to create a new vendor. NOTE: It will be possible to add a vendor from the app, but existing contacts cannot be edited from the app.
  * If it's Vendor-Based, Eby Freight - Yes / No
  * Load Remarks



  


  


  * To start, show list of species and their numbers. Below them, show species that do not have an assigned hotkey that can be manually selected. Prompt for a species hotkey. 1-9 for common species, then 01, 02, etc.
  * When species is specified, show prompt for 2-digit length. Show a prompt to "Press 9 for cutbacks".
  * If the user enters a 9, then prompt for a 2-digit cutback
  * When length/cutback is specified, prompt for 2-digit diameter
  * Then, prompt for 1-digit base grade (0-5)
  * When 1-digit base grade is specified, show list of 0-9 subgrades with prices
    * If they entered 5, this is a Veneer base grade, so prompt for 2 additional numbers.
  * When grade is fully specified, show a list of all log conditions + numbers.
    * Allow 0 to skip and continue to the next log
    * Allow 1-8 to specify a pre-entered condition
    * Allow 9, which will prompt for Other text.



  


  


Have an option to do a Prev/Next/New log. (Add a Delete option, with a prompt.)
