1.2. General Business Process

Eby Sawmill deals almost exclusively with hardwoods. They either buy logs directly from a logger/vendor or they purchase logging rights on tracts of land and hire loggers to harvest the trees to bring into the sawmill. These loads of logs coming from vendors and timber tracts are referred to as "yard tallies." When logs are brought into Eby's, they are graded for quality, measured, and then cut into length. The price a landowner or vendor gets is based on the species, volume, and quality of each log. 

  


Some of the scrap wood from harvesting timber tracts, also called pulpwood, gets transported to paper mills or to people who cut it down for firewood. Loggers transport the pulpwood to these locations and then informs Eby's how many tons of pulpwood was taken. Eby's then pays the logger and the landowner a portion of the pulpwood income.

  


Once at the sawmill, the logs are either cut into lumber or resold as whole logs. Most of the whole logs that are sold get exported overseas. Loads of logs that are sold are referred to as "export tallies." Eby Sawmill works with a broker who has a direct connection with the overseas client. The broker communicates how many shipping containers or board feet of logs the client wants. Once all the loads and information are gathered together, Eby's loads the shipping containers one at a time according to the export tally.

  


To utilize as much of the log as possible, Eby's makes mulch out of the scrap wood and turns the sawdust into wood pellets. This portion of the business process is not being tracked on the EZ Tally Solution.
