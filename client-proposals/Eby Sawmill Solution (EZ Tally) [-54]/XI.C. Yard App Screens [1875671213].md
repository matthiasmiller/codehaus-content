11.3. Yard App Screens

All screens other than the startup screens will have the following: 

  * Home (opens the Home screen; visible for all users)
  * Yard Scaling (begins the yard tally scaling process; visible for Administrator & Log Buyer users)
  * Export Scaling (begins the export tally scaling process; visible for Administrators & Export Scaler/Loader users)
  * Export Loading (begins the export tally loading process; visible for Administrators & Export Scaler/Loader users)



TODO_VA: Tim Reitz 01/17/2024: Let's remove these once they've been merged with the duplicate items in "General Features for Screens".
