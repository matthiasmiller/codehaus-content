3.4. Permissions

  


Requirements

The EZ Tally Solution will include various permissions that control access to/ visibility of various portions of the solution, including reports, records, and parts of records. These permissions are enabled on a per-User Group basis, allowing all users in that group to access the corresponding information.

  


Users in the Administrator user group have full access to the whole system.
