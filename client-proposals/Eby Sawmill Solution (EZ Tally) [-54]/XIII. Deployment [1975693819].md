13\. Deployment

CodeCrafters/CodeHaus will provide support and training for users, especially the admins, throughout the deployment of the software. This may include Zoom calls, recorded video walkthroughs, phone calls, emails, technical support, in-person work, etc. This proposal assumes a total of up to 12 hours of deployment support time; any time beyond that may be billed on a T&M basis. 

  


Admin users may be given access to the dedicated test system prior to/during deployment to allow for practicing and learning the system.
