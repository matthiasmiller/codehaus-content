11.2. Yard App Setup

  


Requirements

The Yard App is a Progressive Web App that runs via the device's browser, and can also be installed as an icon on a mobile device's home screen. Following are instructions to set it up: 

  


  * In your browser, go to [https://eztally.wsgi.apphosting.zone/](https://eztally.wsgi.apphosting.zone/) (or [https://testeztally.wsgi.apphosting.zone/](https://testeztally.wsgi.apphosting.zone/) for the test version)
  * Log in with Google
  * For Android: 
    * For Chrome:
      * The browser tab with the Yard Tally App open should automatically give a prompt to "Install EZTally". 
      * Tapping this prompt will download the app.
        * If the prompt in the browser tab does not appear, click the vertical "..." in the top right, then tap "Install app".
      * The app will be added to your general apps page, under the name "EZTally". You might have to manually add it to your home screen. 
    * For iPhone: 
      * On Safari or Chrome: 
        * From the browser tab that has the Yard App open, tap the share icon in the menu bar. 
        * From the list of options, select "Add to Home Screen" (if you don't see this option, tap "Edit Actions..." and select it from the list of Other Actions). 
        * On the next screen, you can edit the displayed name if you wish, then tap "Add". 
        * This adds an app-like icon to your home screen for easy access.
      * Other browsers: Note that as of initial deployment, this feature is not easily available for some browsers on iPhone (i.e. Brave). However, the iPhone Shortcuts app can be used to set this up for other browsers.
