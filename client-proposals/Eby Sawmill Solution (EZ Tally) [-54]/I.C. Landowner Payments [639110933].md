1.3. Landowner Payments

Landowner Payments have two types - Flat and Adjustable Tiered Percentages.

  


Flat Payments: 

With Landowner Flat payments, Eby's pays a fixed amount to the Landowner for a given Tract. Typically this full amount is split into multiple payments.

There are two types of Flat payments: Date-Based and Harvest-Based.

  * Date-Based Flat payments can be set up in advance for a certain amount and scheduled for a specified due date, and a reminder will alert the admin when they come due. 
  * Harvest-Based Flat payments are paid at certain points along the way of the harvest, typically at the start of harvest, mid harvest, and end of harvest. Harvest-Based Flat payments are used for Tracts that have a Forester involved. These payments can be set up for the specified amount when the Forester alerts the admin that the next payment is due, and the user then sets the due date accordingly. 



  


Adjustable Tiered Percentages Payments: 

With Landowner Adjustable Tiered Percentages Payments (also referred to as "Landowner %" payments), Eby's pays the Landowner a percentage of the harvested value from a Tract. This can be a single flat percentage of the total, but is more often set up in tiers, with a certain percentage being paid for logs of a certain value range, another percentage for logs of a higher value range, etc. For Landowner % - based Tracts, the Landowner also is paid for harvested Pulpwood at a fixed rate per ton. Harvested logs and pulpwood values are automatically added to Payment records, which then are paid/settled on a monthly basis. After a Payment record is marked as Paid, it is replaced by a new Payment record for the same Landowner/Tract.

  


For Tracts that are set as Landowner %, Eby's may make down payments before or at the beginning of harvest. These down payment amounts are linked to a Payment record and appear on the Payment record as a negative amount. This effectively functions as a credit or pre-payment. Values for harvested Yard Tallies or Pulpwood Loads are applied to the Payment record until the total balance is positive, at which point it is included in the normal monthly settlement.

At times Eby's wishes to delay applying some of the initial down payment amount so that the Landowner can receive money from the harvest sooner (this might happen when a Landowner is growing impatient about the progress of the harvest, etc.). In this case, the down payment amount can be split into multiple pieces, and each piece can be applied to a Payment record on a scheduled date. Example:

  * Eby's makes a down payment of $10,000 to the Landowner on January 1 (the check is sent, and the Apply Date is set to 1/1)
  * By March 1, the harvest has reached $8,000, and Eby's see the need to send the Landowner another check before the harvest exceeds $10,000.
  * Eby's breaks apart the inital down payment into two: The initial one, now for $5,000 and still with an Apply Date of 1/1, and a new one for the remaining $5,000 and an Apply Date of 4/1 (and with the same Down Payment Check # as the initial row, since it was included on that check to the Landowner). This allows Eby's to send the client a check for $3,000 (the harvested amount that exceeds the first down payment amount) and settle the first Payment record. The remaining down payment amount is then applied automatically to a new Payment record on 4/1, and ongoing harvest is applied against that.
  * Down Payment amounts can be split apart until the linked Payment record is marked as Paid.



  


Another feature that applies to Landowner % Tracts is Expense Withholding. This is almost identical to the Down Payments feature in function, but from a different angle: Eby's may deduct agreed-upon expenses from what is paid to the Landowner to cover expenses such as building a road into the property, etc. Expense withholding amounts are linked/applied to Payment records like Down Payment amounts, can be split apart like Down Payments, etc.
