Member,

  


We are in the process of preparing tax return information to assign the tax credits you will receive as a part of a Faith Builders Special Purpose Entity.  Is the mailing address we have on our records correct?    

  


Address

  


Please respond by January 10 if the above address is not correct.  Failure to notify us may result in tax filing complications and implications for the assigning of tax credits.

  


We will email the tax documents to you by the first part of February, followed by a paper copy in the mail.
