Member,

  


This is your second year of a two-year commitment to a FB SPE.  We hope to continue our partnership with you and your support of Christian schools through your membership in a Faith Builders Special Purpose Entity (FB SPE).  

  


We will contact you around August 1 with a new Joinder Agreement.

  * Payment due date will be September 1.



We hope to be able to have additional availability of funds.  You may wish to communicate with your tax preparer about the amount of your next commitment.  

  


Contact me with any questions at 814-789-4518 ext. 245 or at [lucym@fbep.org](mailto:lucym@fbep.org).
