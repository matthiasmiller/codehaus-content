11\. Syncing Schools with FBSS

  


Requirements

The solution will include the option to import schools from the SO into the SPE.

  


This will be done initially, as well as on an ongoing basis to keep the two systems in sync. This needs to be easy to run, but it does not need to be automated.

  


Do not allow manually creating schools for FBSS. Require them to be imported, since FBSS needs to reach out to the school first.

  


Development Specification

Include a hidden Imported ID field that is used in the imports to link schools between systems.

[ ] Disallow manually creating schools for FBSS -- this is a detail screen validation that we are not setting a School's Default Scholarship Organization to FBSS unless InImport. 2 hours
