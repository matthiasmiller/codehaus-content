Development Specification

Tim Reitz 12/14/2020: Explanation for the markings in the docs from FB:

  * Yellow highlights are items that need to be customized based on the context.  If we need, instead, to create separate emails for each category, we can do that.  For example, we want one paragraph slightly revised based on the type of contact (current members, pending members, accountants, etc.)
  * Underlined words are items pulled out of the program.
