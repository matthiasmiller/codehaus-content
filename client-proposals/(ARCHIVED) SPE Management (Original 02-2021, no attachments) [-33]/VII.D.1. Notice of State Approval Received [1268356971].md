Contact,

  


We are happy to inform you that a Faith Builders Special Purpose Entity (FB SPE) has received an approval for EITC tax credits.  Approximately $xxx,000 of approved moneys remain available as of today.  This is an opportunity for qualified individuals to contribute money that will be disbursed to the private school(s) of their choice in exchange for a 90% tax credit toward their Pennsylvania tax liability.  

  


Please use this link to submit an application (Joinder Agreement): ___________.  I am attaching two documents: 

  * A copy of our operating agreement
  * A flyer with FAQs  



  


If we receive applications exceeding the amount of credits available to this FB SPE, we will consider the following criteria when prioritizing applications for acceptance:

  * Date of receipt of application
  * Size of contribution 
  * School selection 
    * We will make an effort to benefit a variety of schools.
    * We will give priority to those applications designating 10% or more to Faith Builders as one of the school selections.



  


FB SPE's have the following operating characteristics:

  * FB SPE's require a minimum commitment of $3,000 for two consecutive years.
  * Applicants must submit their contributions within twenty days of acceptance of their application. 
  * 100% of the contribution will be sent to an approved scholarship organization.  We plan to use Faith Builders Scholarship Services, which charges a 5% administration fee and disburses the remaining 95% to schools designated by contributors.  
  * FB SPE members receive 90% of their contribution as a tax credit toward their Pennsylvania tax liability.
