Tim Reitz 06/05/2025: Target timeline: Client would like to have access to the live system over the winter, to be able to have all of the users trained in during the winter. It would be great to have everyone trained in & ready to go by January 1, 2026 (to do a clean break from the old system at that point). Could we try to have the live system deployed in early November 2025? I told that client that it seemed reasonably possible off the top of my head, but that I wasn't promising it. Ellis confirmed that this sounds fine.
