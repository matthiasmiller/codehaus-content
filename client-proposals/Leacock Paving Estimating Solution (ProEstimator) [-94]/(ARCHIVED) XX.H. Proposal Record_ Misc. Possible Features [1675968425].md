Sean Miller 07/07/2025: [[[IN11683](https://zch.apphosting.zone/Detail/Edit/2?RecordType=Incidents&NumberID=-11685&)]] - ZLP - Proposal Record: Misc. Possible Features

  


Following are miscellaneous features that could be considered for the Proposal record: 

  


  * Auto-set the "Proposal Result" field to "Lost" if the Proposal has been "Pending" for a certain amount of time (perhaps 2 years)



  


  * Start storing digital copies of the signed paper Proposals in ProEstimator. As of the time of the Phase 1 design, these are being added to the calendar. These could be added to the Documents section with the jobsite photos, etc. A warning / reminder could be added to help ensure that the files are uploaded.
