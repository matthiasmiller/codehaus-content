[X] Copy in the questions and responses from the "Onboarding" email in [[[W0312](https://zch.apphosting.zone/Detail/Edit/2?RecordType=WikiPages&NumberID=-313&)]] - 13. High-Level Design Prep Emails: 

1\. Do you have Zoom or are you able to get it for the design calls? We use Zoom for the audio, video (if our client is comfortable with it), and occasional screen sharing during our virtual design phases. If you aren't able to join online via the main Zoom platform, you can dial in from a phone for the audio conversation, without downloading or installing anything. If you would like to get Zoom and need help setting it up, you can just let me know.  Zoom is fine I will not have a camera

 

2\. Related to question #1: Do we have your permission to record our design calls? We like to record the calls for reference later on in the project if needed. Only CodeHaus/CodeCrafters have access to these recordings, and we can delete them at the conclusion of the development of the project. We can also share the recordings with you if you would like to access them later for your own reference.

Yes that’s fine

3\. Would you like access to a Google Doc of call notes from the High-Level Design calls? Yes that would be great!

 

4\. Who from your team will be joining these calls? We recommend getting the involvement of the main people who would be using the software solution. This might not be for the whole design phase, but at least for the discussions that pertain to the parts of the software that they will be using. If you have managers, a bookkeeper, or others who will be using the software heavily and whose input would be valuable, we welcome their involvement! We can also add them to some or all of the correspondence if you'd like. Matthew Eisenberger  , Elmer Beiler Jake Ervin King

  


 

Solution Name / Subdomain / Client Code: (included in the "Various questions" email in [[[W0312](https://zch.apphosting.zone/Detail/Edit/2?RecordType=WikiPages&NumberID=-313&)]] - 13. High-Level Design Prep Emails)

[ ] Determine a preliminary project name and subdomain (helpful for shorthand reference in the design phase; possibly used the same for reference longer-term)

  * We like to have an internal name to refer to the project. 
    * Choosing this name does not signify any commitment from either side. 
    * For consistency, we like to use the website address where your software solution would be hosting. 
    * The format is something.apphosting.zone. 
    * Sometimes it is: 
      * Simply the name of the business. 
      * The acronym of the business name. 
      * A name that you choose to assign to the software solution.
    * We're looking for something that is short, unique, memorable, and relevant. 
  * Share suggestions prepared as options or conversation starters: 
    * (see HL Design incident)
  * Settled on:
