1.5.2. Workflow for Proposals: Estimating

When estimating for a Proposal, a user follows the following general steps:

  * Opens the desired Proposal record.
  * Clicks the "+" button beside the "Sections" table, to set up Sections as needed (either selecting from the drop list of default sections or adding custom ones)
  * Clicks the "New Group for Section" button, to add Groups to the itemization (can chose from "Automated", "Sale Item", or "Manual" Groups)
  * Edits the Groups as needed (adding/removing Items, adjusting quantities and pricing, and editing the "Group Name" to customize the "Group Description")
  * Overrides the Oil Index as needed.
  * Marks the Proposal as requiring a deposit, if needed.
  * Marks the Proposal as including Unit Price Details, if needed (and sets the details)
  * Adds Proposal Notes as needed
  * When finished, sets the "Ready to Send to Customer" checkbox to freeze the estimating details and set the Proposal Date.
