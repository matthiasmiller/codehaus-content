1.5.1. Workflow for Proposals: Receiving a Lead

When a call or email is received, a user follows the following general steps:

  * Clicks on the "New Lead" or "New Proposal" menu option.
  * Selects the Customer name from the drop list (after setting up a new Customer-type Contact record, if needed). 
  * Enters "Customer & Job Information" details and the "Lead Information" details. 
  * Saves the new Proposal record.



  


  


Note that Proposals can also be created from other Proposals -- see the "Copying Proposals" workflow notes.
