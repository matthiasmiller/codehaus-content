12.1. Solution Configuration

  


Requirements

General Configuration: The following details are to be configured as part of setting up the Solution at deployment. These are to be done either by CodeCrafters or as a joint effort between the CodeCrafters support team and Leacock Paving: 

  * [X] Set the User Login Format for the live system
  * [ ] Configure Silverloom Settings (see the corresponding spec) 
    * TODO_CLIENT: Ben Reitz 11/19/2025: Please adjust "Leacock Paving Settings" as needed, specifically Oil Index $.
  * [X] Configure the System Switches (as needed; see corresponding spec) 
    * _CLENT: Ben Reitz 11/19/2025: What "From" email address? Presumably info@?
    * _BR: Ben Reitz 11/19/2025: Put together list of Esignatures: Adobe, PandaDoc, other options?
  * [ ] Configure automatic processes (see the corresponding section) 
    * TODO_BR: Set up scheduled task after SMTP settings are configured.
  * [X] Configure S3 integration & storage (see the corresponding section) 
  * [X] Configure User Groups (see the corresponding section) 
  * [X] Configure Contact Types (see the corresponding section) 
  * [X] Configure other Configuration records as needed (see the corresponding sections) 



TODO_BR: Tim Reitz 11/21/2025: I noticed the Lead Source and Proposal Notes config records - let's talk with the clients about what they would like set up there initially. 

  * [ ] Configure outbound email settings for sending automated emails (SMTP, etc.) 
  * etc



  


Automated Proposal Group Formulas: CodeCrafters will work with Leacock Paving to configure formulas for automated groups.

  


Training details: CodeCrafters will provide support and training for users, especially primary users, throughout the deployment of the software. 

  


This proposal assumes a total of up to 10 hours of support & training time during the deployment process. Additional time beyond that may be billed on a per-hour/T&M basis. 

  


Primary users may be given access to the dedicated test system prior to deployment to allow for practicing and learning the system. 

  


Final details are to be determined, but this may include Zoom calls, recorded video walkthroughs, phone calls, emails, and/or written documentation.
