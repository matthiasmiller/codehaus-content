15\. HLDPricing Estimate

  


Requirements

Design and Development

CodeCrafters has reviewed the high-level design that we put together for your software solution. Keep in mind that the final quoted price would come after the completion of an In-Depth Design, and could be higher or lower than this, or somewhere around what we're thinking now, depending on how all the details work out. Based on the information we gathered in the high-level design, we are anticipating this to be in the $30K-50K range for development and deployment of this solution. 

  


If this looks higher than what your budget would allow, we could potentially reduce cost and scope in one or more ways, such as starting out with only a few features and adding others as time goes on, or simplifying various parts of the solution. We're committed to giving you high value with whatever you move forward with, and we'd be glad to discuss this with you on a call if you have any questions.

  


We would like to invite you to enter the In-Depth Design phase to finalize the system design. The in-depth design will include:

  * Reviewing the high-level design and adapting it to client requirements
  * Revising and completing all mockups and wireframes for the system
  * Complete technical specifications for the entire system
  * Coding an interactive test UI for the entry of items on the proposal record
  * Providing a specific price quote for the development of the software



  


The In-Depth Design is available as T&M (estimated at $5-8K) or as a fixed-cost option ($8,500). This includes software development for the interactive test UI noted above.

  


Maintenance and Support

Also, as with building a house or buying a vehicle, there are ongoing maintenance expenses to make sure the software keeps working well for the long haul. When we build a software solution, we provide ongoing support and maintenance that includes the following:

  * System hosting
  * Regular backups
  * Monitoring
  * Unlimited U.S.-based phone support
  * Up-to-date system documentation
  * Security updates and bug fixes
  * Enhancements to the Silverloom platform
  * Design for minor system change requests



  


Industry standards show that software maintenance typically has an annual cost of about 10-25% of the original investment. We would expect your annual maintenance expenses to be in the 10-15% range (probably $4K-7K per year based on our current ballpark estimate).

  


Hosting depends on the number of users, but is expected to be $200-250/month for 5-10 users.

  


Pricing Breakdown

High-Level Design (HLD)| $3,500| Already paid  
---|---|---  
In-Depth Design (IDD)(This is offered as T&M or as fixed-cost)| Est T&M: $5-8,000orFixed Cost: $8,500| Due at the commencement of the IDD process, If you wish to start soon, it could all be paid at once. If you wish to wait a few weeks or months, we could invoice you for 50% to save you a place in the design pipeline, with the other 50% due when design starts. For T&M, the 50% is based on the minimum estimate with the balance due on completion.  
Anticipated development cost (This will be offered as T&M or as fixed-cost)| $30,000-50,000  
| To be refined and finalized at the conclusion of the IDD. Generally includes coding, extensive QA testing, and deployment; likely divided as follows in the next 3 rows.  
Due to start coding| 40% of development cost|   
  
Due to start testing| 40% of development cost|   
  
Due on deployment| 20% (remainder) of final cost|   
  
Ongoing maintenance| TBD| Generally 10-15% of the final development cost (anticipated at $4K-7K if paid annually; $400-700 per month if paid monthly)  
Hosting for 5-10 users with S3 storage| est $200-250 / month| Base of $150 for up to 5 users, $25 / month for S3 documents, $15 per user for users 6-15, $10 per user for users 16-25, $5 per user for 26+
