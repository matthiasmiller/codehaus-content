6.3.1.1. My Leads Report

  


Requirements

Overview: This is the "Master Proposals Report", filtered to display only leads assigned to the current user.

  


Accessed from:

  * Main Menu | Leads | My Leads (opens the report directly, bypassing the filter screen)
    * Note that this displays a blank report if the current user is not set as the Sales Rep for any Proposals.



  


The following filter(s) are set differently than on the main report:

  * "Report View" = "Current Leads" (note that "Sort By" is automatically set based on this)
  * "Sales Rep": Set to the Contact for the current user 



  


Other Notes:

  * This report (like all others) can be printed from the drop-down advanced menu in the top left-hand corner of the screen, by selecting "PDF" or "Excel".
