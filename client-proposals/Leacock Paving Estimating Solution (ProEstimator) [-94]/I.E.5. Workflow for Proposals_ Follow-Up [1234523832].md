1.5.5. Workflow for Proposals: Follow-Up

  * Once a Proposal has been sent, after a set amount of time has passed the Sales Rep receives a reminder from the software for an initial and secondary follow-up. The Sales Rep documents when follow-up is completed.
  * When the Customer replies (or if the Customer never replies), the Sales Rep sets the "Proposal Result":  
    * If lost: Set to "Lost" \- nothing more to do at this point 
    * If awarded: Set to "Awarded" \- sends the "Job Awarded" email, and continues the process 
    * If still uncertain: Set to "Pending" \-- to be pursued more in the future, etc.
    * Otherwise: Set to "Archived" \- nothing more to do at this point
