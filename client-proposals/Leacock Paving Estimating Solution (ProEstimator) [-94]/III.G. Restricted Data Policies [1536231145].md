3.7. Restricted Data Policies

  


Requirements

Overview: Restricted Data Policies can be accessed and configured via Advanced | Admin | Configure Restricted Data Policies. This is an additional tool that can be used to restrict or allow access to certain features in the Solution. 

  


Once a Policy is configured, it can be selected on a User Group record to apply it to all users of that Group. 

  


Note that these Policies can be edited manually in the Solution, so they may become out of sync with this spec if changes are not communicated and documented. 

  


The following are configured in the Solution: 

  


  * N/A (none for Phase 1, but this section is included as a placeholder)
