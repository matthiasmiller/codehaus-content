6.3.1.4. Proposals by Customer Report

  


Requirements

Overview: This is the "Master Proposals Report", filtered to display all items for a single Customer. Note that this includes all Proposal records for the Customer, including leads and lost / archived / scheduled Proposals, which do not appear on the main All Proposals Report by default. 

  


Accessed from:

  * "Proposals for Customer" link on the Customer-type Contact record



  


The following filter(s) are set differently than on the main report:

  * "Customer": Set to the Contact from which the report is opened 
  * "Sort By" = "Proposal #"



  


Other Notes:

  * This report (like all others) can be printed from the drop-down advanced menu in the top left-hand corner of the screen, by selecting "PDF" or "Excel".
