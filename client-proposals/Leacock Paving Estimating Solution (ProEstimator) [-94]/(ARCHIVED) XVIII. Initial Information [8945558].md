18\. Initial Information

Standard Questions for Each Design: 

  


Include questions and answers that were asked in the "Various Questions" email in [[[W0312](https://zch.apphosting.zone/Detail/Edit/2?RecordType=WikiPages&NumberID=-313&)]] - 13. High-Level Design Prep Emails: 

1\. On a scale of 1 to 10, how important is it to access the software from a mobile device, such as a phone or tablet? 8

 

2\. Do you want to import data from an existing software system or spreadsheets? If yes, what data (i.e. contacts, sales items, invoices, etc.)? Customer contacts, be able to attach PDF or photo’s` also being able to sinc with quickbooks in the future

 

3\. We offer two options for login format: A quick login using Gmail/Google accounts, and a username/password login. It can also be set up so that some users use one and others use the other. Which format would you prefer?  username/password login would be best as we don’t use gmail accounts

 

4\. Will you want to restrict access to certain portions of the system from some users? If so, you can be thinking through what groups of users you will want to have and what portions of the system you would like them to be able to access.  I would like to be able to certain users only to change price list

 

5\. Do you want to use time tracking for employees? No but lead tracking and deals closed and awarded

 

6\. What would you like to call the software solution? Sometimes our clients refer to it with a generic term such as "CRM system" or "our software", but some clients like to give their solution a more specific name. It's nice to give it a name or description that is and easy to use. We don't need this right away, but you can be thinking about this as we get started on the design. I think ProEstimator would be a good name for it

Ben Reitz 10/08/2024: From the client: I would like to screen share on our zoom call. I think I would be able to show it better there then anywhere.
