At some point, the ProEstimator Solution could integrate with QuickBooks to streamline data entry (eliminating the need for manually entering job information into QuickBooks after a Proposal has been awarded). There are various approaches that could be taken, such as:

  * Export files generated from ProEstimator and imported into QuickBooks



  


If/when Leacock Paving is ready to pursue a QuickBooks sync, details can be researched and considered.
