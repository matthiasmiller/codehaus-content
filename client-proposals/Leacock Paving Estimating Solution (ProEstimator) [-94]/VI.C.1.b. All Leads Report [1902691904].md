6.3.1.2. All Leads Report

  


Requirements

Overview: This is the "Master Proposals Report", filtered to display only leads.

  


Accessed from:

  * Main Menu | Leads | All Leads (opens the report directly, bypassing the filter screen)



  


The following filter(s) are set differently than on the main report:

  * "Report View" = "Current Leads" (note that "Sort By" is automatically set based on this)



  


Other Notes:

  * This report (like all others) can be printed from the drop-down advanced menu in the top left-hand corner of the screen, by selecting "PDF" or "Excel".
