4.2. Sales Item Categories List

  


Requirements

This is a standard simple list used to track categories for Sales Items. In the ProEstimator Solution this is a non-editable list (custom behavior). 

  


It includes the following items: 

  * Equipment
  * Hauling 
  * Labor
  * Material 
  * Misc
  * Service



  


This list is universal for all users. 

  


This list is set up by CodeCrafters as part of the main development. If changes need to be made to this list, it will require some coding work.
