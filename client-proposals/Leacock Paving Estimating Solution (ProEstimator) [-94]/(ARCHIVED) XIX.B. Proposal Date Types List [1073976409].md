Requirements

_VA: Tim Reitz 04/07/2025: Not sure if we actually need this list after all.. 

Tim Reitz 04/10/2025: Yes, looks like we can get rid of this. I'll archive it for now. 

  


  


This is a custom non-editable simple list used to list the different types of dates that are tracked on Proposal records. It includes the following items: 

  


  * Received Date
  * Appointment Date 
  * Proposal Date
  * Sent to Client Date 
  * Initial Follow-Up Date 
  * Secondary Follow-Up Date 
  * Result Date
  * Target Start Date 



  


This list is universal for all users.

  


Note that this sequence is static, so it should always be displayed in this sequence throughout the Solution.

  


This list will be set up by CCI as part of the main development. If changes need to be made to this list, it will require some coding work.
