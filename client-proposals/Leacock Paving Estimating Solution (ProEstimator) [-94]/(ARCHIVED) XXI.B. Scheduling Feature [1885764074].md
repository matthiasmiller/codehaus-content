A scheduling feature could be added to ProEstimator, to provide easier scheduling for the scheduler. This could be done within ProEstimator as a Silverloom feature, or an integration with Outlook Calendar could be considered. 

  


Other Notes: 

  * Each crew currently has their own Outlook Calendar for scheduling.
