20\. Optional Add-Ons

_SM: Tim Reitz 07/07/2025: You can start deactivating items from here. 

  


The following items are included as optional add-ons that could be done as part of Phase 1, or at a later date. These include various types of items, such as: 

  * Items that were not "on the radar" in the High-Level Design and. 
  * Items that are more complex features that improve automation and/or usability for the more basic features that are included in the main spec above. 



  


Some of these are fully specced and ready to be coded if chosen. Others include only a summary or list of possible ideas; these would require additional design work and pricing before being ready to be added. 

  


Any prices noted for add-on items below are in addition to the price for the main Phase 1 Solution and would be accepted separately unless specifically added into the main proposal.

  


Also, the estimated price noted for each one is approximate, and may change if the features are added at a later date as change requests (compared to including them in Phase 1). As such, each would need individual review and possibly updated design & pricing if considered as change requests in the future.
