1.3. Project Goals

Leacock Paving is seeking a new estimating solution to replace their existing solution, which is based is Microsoft Power Apps.

  


Specific goals for this new project include:

  * Reliability and stability - the current software occasionally loses changes without any warning. 
  * Improved performance - the current software is slow with inconsistent performance. 
  * Ease of proposal creation - the new solution should make it easy for the sales team to create or modify proposals. 



  


Leacock has chosen "ProEstimator" as the official name for this Silverloom solution. It is referenced as such throughout this proposal.

  


Core functionality should include the ability to do the following:

  * Record and manage lead call details.
  * Create proposals with "Sections", each of which may contain multiple "Groups" (lines on the printout itemization). Each Group is priced based on individual Items in that Group.
  * Quickly generate new versions of proposals, using previous ones as templates for the same client.
  * Automatically create polished, formatted PDFs for proposals, work orders, and call logs.
  * Provide an easy way to email proposals to customers.
  * Track and monitor the status of all open proposals at a glance (all on one screen).
  * Generate reports on sales performance by time period and Sales Rep for better insights.
  * Marked awarded proposals as scheduled, setting a scheduled start date on a per-Group basis. 



  


Data migration: Data will be imported into the ProEstimator solution from the existing Power App solution.
