6.3.1.6. My Proposals Needing Follow-Up Report

  


Requirements

Overview: This is the "Master Proposals Report", filtered to display items needing follow-up for a single Sales Rep.

  


Accessed from:

  * Main Menu | Proposals | My Proposals Needing Follow-Up (opens the report directly, bypassing the filter screen)
  * The "Proposals Needing Follow-Up" report alert



  


The following filter(s) are set differently than on the main report:

  * "Report View" = "Proposals Needing Follow-Up" (note that this makes the special groupings visible at the bottom of the report) 
  * "Sales Rep": Set to the Contact for the current user 



  


Other Notes:

  * This report (like all others) can be printed from the drop-down advanced menu in the top left-hand corner of the screen, by selecting "PDF" or "Excel".
