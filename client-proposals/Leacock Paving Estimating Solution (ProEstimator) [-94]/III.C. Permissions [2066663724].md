3.3. Permissions

  


Requirements

The ProEstimator Solution includes various custom permissions that control visibility and/or editability of various portions of the solution, including reports, records, and parts of records. These permissions normally are enabled on a per-User Group basis, allowing all Users in a Group to access the corresponding information.

  


Users in the "System Administrator" User Group have full access to the whole system.

  


The table below lists the relevant permissions in the Solution and the User Groups that have the corresponding permissions enabled:
