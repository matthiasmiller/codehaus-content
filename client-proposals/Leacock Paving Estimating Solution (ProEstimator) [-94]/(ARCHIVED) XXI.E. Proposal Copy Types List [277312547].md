21.5. Proposal Copy Types List

  


Requirements

_VA / _NM: Tim Reitz 09/19/2025: This would go away if we remove the "Copy Type" feature. 

Tim Reitz 09/23/2025: Making this section inactive (we've officially done away with the "Copy Type" feature). 

  


  


This is a custom non-editable simple list used to set and track the Copy Type for copied Proposals. It includes the following items: 

  


  * Revised
  * Change Order
  * Duplicate



  


This list is universal for all users.

  


Note that this sequence is static, so it should always be displayed in this sequence throughout the Solution.

  


This list will be set up by CodeCrafters as part of the main development. If changes need to be made to this list, it will require some coding work.
