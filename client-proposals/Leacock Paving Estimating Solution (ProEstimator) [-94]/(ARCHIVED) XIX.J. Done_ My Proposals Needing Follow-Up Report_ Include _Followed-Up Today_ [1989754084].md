Tim Reitz 07/03/2025: Incorporated into the main spec. 

  


The following feature could be added to include Proposals that the Sales Rep already followed up on on the current day, for easy reference (so that those don't just "disappear" from the report when he completes them).

[X] Initial Spec (details to be finalized): 

  * New special "Awarded Today" / "Followed Up Today" / "Lost Today" groupings at the bottom of the report, visible only for this filtered report, displaying (in green font for "Awarded", black font for "Lost", and gray font for others) all Proposals for the Sales Rep that have been followed up on the current date (specifically, with one of the "Follow-Up Completed" dates or "Proposal Result Date" = to the current date).
