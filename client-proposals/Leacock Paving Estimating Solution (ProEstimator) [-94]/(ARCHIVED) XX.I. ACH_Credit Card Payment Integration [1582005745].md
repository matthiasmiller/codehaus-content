20.9. ACH/Credit Card Payment Integration

Leacock has interest in including a feature for ACH and credit card payments. There are varying levels of complexity that could be considered here, for example: 

  


  * Simple: Links in outbound emails for customers to go to an external website to enter payment information. 
  * Complex: Full integration with 3rd-party payment processing providers. 



  


A simple feature probably will provide the highest return on investment in this case (though if the Silverloom Accounting Module is added at some point, a more complex feature might be worth considering).
