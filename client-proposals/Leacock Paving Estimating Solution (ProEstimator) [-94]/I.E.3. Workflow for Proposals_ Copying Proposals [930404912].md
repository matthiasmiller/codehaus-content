1.5.3. Workflow for Proposals: Copying Proposals

Workflow: Proposals may be copied for various reasons, as detailed below. Copying is done via the following process: 

1\. From a Proposal record, select the standard Silverloom copy feature that is included in the small drop-down menu in the top right-hand corner of the record screen ("Copy this Proposal"). 

2\. Open the new copied Proposal record. 

3\. Select a copy type button to choose the approach to take from there. 

4\. Update any Overridden Items.

5\. Save the new Proposal record.

  


Overview / Other Notes: 

  * When a Revised Proposal or Duplicate Proposal is created, it defaults to the current pricing for the PA Oil Index (if not overridden on the Source Proposal) and any non-overridden Sales Items. It also updates non-overridden Sales Items for any "Automated Proposal Group" that are copied over (i.e. if any Sales Items were added to or removed from the Automated Proposal Group since the Source Proposal was created).
  * Changes made to a Copied Proposal do not affect its Source Proposal. 
  * Changes made to a Source Proposal do not affect any Proposals that already have been copied from it.
  * Proposals of any Status may be copied.



  


There are three approaches to copying a Proposal record: 

  * Create Revised Proposal: 
    * Explanation: Used for revising an existing Proposal for the same Customer, if enough time has passed since the original Proposal was generated (and prices have changed, etc.) or if the Customer wants pricing for different options.
    * Overview: 
      * Set up by selecting the "Revised Proposal" button on a newly-copied Proposal record. 
      * Creates a "Revised"-Type copy of the Proposal for the same Customer + Job Name, retaining most details from the source Proposal (see "Revised Proposal" button spec and "Copy Action Details" spec). 
    * Other Notes: 
      * Can be created from:
        * All Proposal Types
      * Can have the following created from it:
        * Revised Proposal (one or multiple)
        * Change Order (one or multiple)
        * Duplicate (one or multiple)



  


  * Create Change Order: 
    * Explanation: Used for extra features that are added to a job after the Proposal has been awarded by the Customer. Note that this is not used for removing items from a Proposal (a Revised Proposal is needed for that).
    * Overview: 
      * Set up by selecting the "Change Order" button on a newly-copied Proposal record. 
      * Creates a "Change Order"-Type copy of the Proposal for the same Customer + Job Name, retaining some details from the source Proposal (see "Change Order" button spec and "Copy Action Details" spec). 
    * Other Notes: 
      * Can be created from:
        * Original Proposal
        * Revised Proposal
        * Duplicate Proposal
      * Can have the following created from it:
        * Revised Proposal (one or multiple)
        * Duplicate (one or multiple)
        * ("Change Order" button is hidden on copies made from a "Change Order"-type Source) 



  


  * Create Duplicate Proposal: 
    * Explanation: Used mostly for Commercial jobs, for times when multiple different Customers (normally contractors) are bidding on the same job and asking Leacock Paving for a quote. This saves the Sales Reps time, since they don't have to manually recreate a Proposal for the same project multiple times, and allows them to specify different details and/or pricing for the different Customers for the same job. 
    * Overview: 
      * Set up by selecting the "Duplicate Proposal" button on a newly-copied Proposal record.
      * Creates a "Duplicate"-Type copy of the Proposal, retaining some details from the source Proposal (see "Duplicate Proposal" button spec and "Copy Action Details" spec).  
    * Other Notes: 
      * Can be created from:
        * Original Proposal
        * Revised Proposal
        * Duplicate Proposal
      * Can have the following created from it:
        * Revised Proposal (one or multiple)
        * Duplicate (one or multiple)
        * Change Order (one or multiple)
