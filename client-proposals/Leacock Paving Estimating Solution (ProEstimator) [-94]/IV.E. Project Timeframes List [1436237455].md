4.5. Project Timeframes List

  


Requirements

This is a custom non-editable, unsorted simple list used to track the time frame in which a lead wishes to have their project completed. It includes the following items: 

  


  * ASAP
  * Spring
  * Summer
  * Fall
  * Next Year



  


This list is universal for all users.

  


Note that this sequence is static, so it should always be displayed in this sequence throughout the Solution.

  


This list will be set up by CodeCrafters as part of the main development. If changes need to be made to this list, it will require some coding work.
