Tracking could be added for sales commission for the Sales Reps. This could include adding the following: 

  * Changes to the Proposal record: 
    * Job Complete / Invoiced (checkbox + date; used as the baseline for determining when commission should be paid) 
    * Commission $ (auto-calculated) 
    * Commission Paid (checkbox) 
  * New "Sales Commission" report (shows unpaid and paid commission, with the option to mark commission as paid for one or multiple Proposals)
