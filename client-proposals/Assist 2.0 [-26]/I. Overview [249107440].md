Additional modules, to be prioritized after the rest are:

  * Giftology



  


Affordable Barns has approximately 18 shops.

Background of Discussion around Compass:

  * Executed agreement with Sheds Direct
  * Sheds Direct want to build their own buildings and bypass the builders.
  * The builders want to find their own dealers by bypassing Sheds Direct
  * Builders think they could build twice the buildings and Sheds Direct could sell them all.
  * Want 70% of the buildings to be sold through Assist 2.0



Mismatch of values between Sheds Direct and Builders about the sales process...

  


We will get a VM of compass that we can spelunk through.
