4.6. Lead Time Calculation

Current lead time calculation is based strictly on the builder time frame. It is currently calculated using the Average Daily Production (for a rolling window) divided by Total BPR Production, plus an additional lead time buffer. We have a required minimum lead time, as well.

  


We want to integrate a few things into the lead time as well:

  * Margin for expedited buildings
  * Delivery lead times
  * Repairs



  


This will be used to determine the minimum delivery date. The customer will be able to choose a delivery on or after that date. If the customer chooses to wait for delivery, the building will fall down the list on the BPR.
