4.6.4. Lead Time Audit

Matthias Miller 09/21/2020: Can we provide some kind of auditing of promises? Per hauler? Per builder? Reason?

  


I think for this, we track the scheduled delivery date. Based on that, the target production completion date. We track the actual build completion date, as well as the actual delivery date. We also track the specific shop (and team members, too, or no?) as well as the delivery driver.

  


We need to think through what reports we'd want for that...

  * Delivery Exception Report -- grouped by driver, where delivery was X days later than build (assuming that if production slipped schdule, the delivery isn't to blame), or where delivery was on time, but build was late (green light)
  * Building Exception Report -- grouped by shop, where production complete was after schedule date



What filters?

  * Shop?
  * Date range?



  


Matthias Miller 09/29/2020: Late payments are not an issue in regards -- if we promise a lead time of X, and we're held up because payment wasn't received...

Matthias Miller 09/29/2020: Online customer would make full payment, but a dealer would takea  downpayment from the customer, and sometimes the dealer doesn't collect the final payment until delivery ---need to think this through...

Matthias Miller 09/29/2020: Duane will check into when final payment is received.

  


Matthias Miller 09/25/2020: Run this past Duane?
