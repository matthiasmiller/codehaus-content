4.6.3. Repairs

Matthias Miller 09/21/2020: Need to factor repairs into the production process -- what % of time is spent on repairs --- most times sends a repair back to the guy on location -- 

for example, be able to schedule repairs on a specific date

looking at 3-week turnaround for repairs right now -- wanting to bring it down -- should be done a couple days w/in an issue

  


  


Matthias Miller 09/25/2020: observation -- this could be used to incentivize picture-taking on the lot and on site, since it points to the source of the issue

  


Matthias Miller 09/25/2020: Phone call - do we have a repair margin? Are we moving people on-site? How should this be handled.
