4.6.1. Expedited Buildings

Expedited buildings will be provided at an additional charge to fill the extra margin in the schedule. The lead times will be calculated separately:

  * The expedited lead time is calculated based on X% of the Average Daily Production (based on the specified margin), including only the expedited buildings
  * The standard lead time is calculated based on the remainder of the Average Daily Production, excluding all expedited buildings.



Unfilled margin for the expedited buildings will be filled with lot buildings.
