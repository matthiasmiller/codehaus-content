4.8.1. Pre-Production Confirmation

Two days before production is scheduled to start for a building, require the ______

  * Matthias Miller 09/25/2020: Big question....does this get channeled through the dealer? Who's ultimately responsible for maintaining that conversation w/ the customer?



  


Should we have an SMS/Email attempt 4 days before, then follow-up with a manual update if there's no response?

  


Matthias Miller 09/25/2020: Do we give them a chance to reschedule for a later production date?

Matthias Miller 09/25/2020: Do we see if we can move other ones (such as expedited) earlier? Do we leave that manual?

  


  * Have the confirmation lead time be configurable, as well as the messages...



Matthias Miller 09/25/2020: If they want to reschedule their delivery, is that based strictly on the delivery lead time, or do they get an entirely new lead time based on the ideal build time for the shop? Do you reorder the other buildings and let them sit on the lot longer? Or do you force them to go to the end of the dealer lead time, and replace that building with an expedited/lot building?
