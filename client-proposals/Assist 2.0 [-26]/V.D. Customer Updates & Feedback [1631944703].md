5.4. Customer Updates & Feedback

TODO_DB - Is this still a priority?

  


Matthias Miller 09/21/2020: For customer updates, we can use the GPS off the driver's phone.

  * could have the delivery app let the customer sign off on the delivery
  * picutres when it's leaving the sales lot, when it's in place, etc all connected to the building if there's ever an issue before it left the lot, etc -- can be done
  * get GPS of where the delivery actually happened



  


  


  


  


Customer communication

  * When it comes to text messages...must have a way for customers to sign consent (FCC has rulings that you can't text someone unless they consent to it)
  * Add a clause to the agreement if they opt into SMS notifications.
