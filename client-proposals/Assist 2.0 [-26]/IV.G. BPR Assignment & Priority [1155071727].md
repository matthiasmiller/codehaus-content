4.7. BPR Assignment & Priority

Currently the BPR assignment and priority is generated by Compass and pulled into Assist every night. This includes all the information for the building, as well as who should be building it.

  


We need to be able to assign buildings to specific shops. We will give our best assignment, then allow the buildings to be moved around.
