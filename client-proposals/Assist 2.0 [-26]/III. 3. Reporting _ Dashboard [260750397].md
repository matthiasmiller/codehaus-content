Per Gabe:

1.shop efficiency

2.model profitability

3.actual profitability

Matthias Miller 11/11/2020:

  * want to take 8% of base divided by total station hours



  


  * want a production efficiency number that you can compare shops against with
  * profitability per sheds - which sheds make money, these don't



  


profit % per man hour .... to avoid inflation skew (?)

  


  


  * Inflation %
  * Inflation $
  * Inflation-Adjusted Total



Matthias Miller 11/11/2020: This can be integrated into the dashboard and reporting module.

  


  


  


  


  


Dashboard

Feeling among the builders that the dashboard is not accurate -- missing the information or not trusting the dashboard?

Combining multiple statistics into single graph (HTML)

>>>> Adding transparency to the numbers could add trust (?? if we can w/ fax ??)

Matthias Miller 09/17/2020: Waiting on Mark Troyer for Clarification

  


  


Matthias Miller 10/13/2020: Feedback from Mark:

The reports they're looking at are maybe at a per-week basis...

comparisons w/ other shops, district, time period, etc

  


want to see efficiencies...comparing the data from one to the other...for example, why is this shop so profitable on Smart Sheds, but why is NC/Vinyl Structures so profitable on Vinyle sheds, or in OH that all LuxGuard buildings are so profitable?

  


Matthias Miller 10/08/2020: Need to provide transparency into how the numbesr were calculated -- and also per-building break-down (station and employee)

Matthias Miller 10/08/2020: Need to show the recorded and the adjusted hours...

  


  


  


Eventually, we could add some kind of reporting of when a building type is outside of a specific variance of standard build times, etc.

  


  


  


This bonus amount will NOT affect the labor costs for specific buildings.

Matthias Miller 10/22/2020: Hard Numbers vs. Benchmark Numbers

>> For every shop that's out there, production * 8% creates the pool -- all the hours get added, per man-hour number, multiplied to each hours per building -- this is the exact dollar value of labor -- compares efficiency of shops

>> Shop A - $100K production in one week -- broken into different hours for different sheds. How do you compare tier rate efficiency vs pool?  Thus, essentially excluding them from the rate calculations --- want to be able to compare time rate, etc

>> How do you spread vacation time on profitability numbers?
