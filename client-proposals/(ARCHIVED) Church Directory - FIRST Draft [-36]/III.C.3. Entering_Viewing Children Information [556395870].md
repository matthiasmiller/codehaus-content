3.3.3. Entering/Viewing Children Information

  


Requirements

The Household screen contains two tables:

  * Children Outside of Household -- this is a readonly display of children that have their own household sorted by birthdate.
  * Children with No/New Households -- this editable table supports adding children that are still at home as well as providing fast entry for children that have their own household. For these, a new Household # can be entered (an error is given if the child household already exists). Upon saving the screen, new household records are automatically created for these children and they are automatically displayed in the "Children Outside of Household" table. These are also sorted by birth date.



  


Gender is required if the child's household # is entered.

  


The embedded spreadsheet for entering children will initially include 10 blank rows. Unused/blank rows will be automatically removed on save. It will include a button to add additional blank rows (used when editing a previously-saved record).
