3.4. Configuring Formatting

  


Requirements

The AppHosting.zone settings will include three editable templates that will be used to generate the directory:

  


  * Household Entry Template (referencing household record)
  * Minister Entry Template (referencing household record)
  * School Entry Template (referencing school record)



  


The templates can be edited by the client or by CodeCrafters in the future. CodeCrafters will work with the client to ensure that the templates are specified correctly during deployment.

  


These will be visible with the "Can view/edit Church Directory" permission.
