3.2. Schools

  


Requirements

The school will include a School Name, Church #, and Active checkbox. Both fields are required.

  


Churches can have multiple schools. Two schools may have the same name, but be in different churches.

  


The New School link will prompt to save the current school, then open a new, blank school.

  


These will not be linked to households in any way.

  


See mockups.

  


Development Specification

Ellis Miller 04/21/2021: 

Very simple screen.

With New School auto-push report.

  


Record Type could be "Church Directory School". This is a lookup type.

  


Bid: 4 hours

  


The name will be a separate name field, so that we can have a "SchoolName #ChurchNumber" format in the name, to allow duplicate names but prevent duplicate school+church combinations.
