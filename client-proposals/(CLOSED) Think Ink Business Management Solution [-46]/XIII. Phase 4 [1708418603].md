13\. Phase 4

  


Requirements

Phase 4 would include the following:

  * Page Count Reporting
  * Invoicing
  * Prepay feature for Billing Groups



  


Possibly included: 

  * [ ] Data collection / surveys in Check-In incidents 



TODO_JM: discuss this more (maybe include in Phase 4 or 5? or what is the priority for you?)  

  * Looking for customer retention
  * Looking to be able to better track / group / use data that's collected from check-ins
  * List / RG of pre-set questions with drop list of pre-set answers (maybe a custom text field too?)
  * Current satisfaction, anticipated future needs, etc.
  * 

  * [ ] Consider adding Snippets for Incidents
