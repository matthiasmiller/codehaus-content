15.5. Workflows

General workflows: TODO_CH: Tim Reitz 05/20/2022: These could be moved to History if they don't seem helpful. I was wanting to document the workflows (probably especially with the Living Spec in mind). 

Sales:

  * Customer calls in
  * TI salesperson creates a Sales Opportunity incident
  * TI salesperson creates a linked PO in ___ that goes to the vendor 



TODO_JM: where does the PO live? how to link to the Inciddent?

  * External vendor emails invoice to the customer



TODO_JM: is this right?

  * Automatic Email Manager that takes off the attachments when they come on the incoming emails, puts them in a folder and prints them. (This is described in the Automatic Email Manager section.)
  * These ___ get entered into their system, then they're paid



TODO_JM: paid in CA, right?

  * Set up the Device record(s)
    * New Device (or open an existing Available Device) 
    * Enter information
    * Select the desired Billing Group/___, create a new one, or leave the Device unlinked
    * Save
  * (Optional) Set up the Billing Group/MPS record or update an existing one:
