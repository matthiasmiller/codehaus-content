Other Notes: 

Possible future feature: Email Integration for customer Service ticket submissions: For now, when a customer calls or emails with a support/service need, a user will create the Service-type incident manually. However, a future possibility would be to incorporate email integration to auto-create these incidents when a customer sends an email to a specified email address. Note that something similar could be developed for receiving page counts from customers via email (using a separate specified email address). In either case, responses could be sent back to the customer from within the Solution (provided the outbound email does not require file attachments). In the event that this automation is set up, there should be a flag or tag on the incident indicating that it was set up via the automation.
