9.3. Add AppHosting Accounting Module

DONE_EM: Tim Reitz 07/18/2023: Client is thinking that they do want to switch to the AppHosting Accounting module before they get too much further, probably after Phase 3. Client sounds like they have interest making the switch around the end of the year. Client mentioned that Ellis had some concerns about handling sales tax.

*DONE_JM: Tim Reitz 07/19/2023: Per Ellis, we can integrate with a 3rd party library to make it work (we're doing it for other clients). 

Ellis is guessing $5-10K up front for the transition; then $195/month for the standard accounting module. Not cheap compared to other options that are out there; totally fine if you don't want to spend that much. But does give deep integration built-in, and will continue to be developed over time. 

DONE_EM: Tim Reitz 07/25/2023: Went over this with the client today. He thinks they want to go forward with it. He thinks it will make sense. What should be the next steps for this?

DONE_IDD: Tim Reitz 07/25/2023: add new section for adding the accounting module (probably Phase 4). Make sure we document the numbers that we told him.

  


  


TODO_EM: Tim Reitz 08/10/2023: Client would like to have a conversation to look at what customizations they would need for the accounting module. Also wondering about a target deployment. 

  


  


TODO_: Things to think through / include: 

  * Full migration / switch over of Contacts (remove the sync, etc.)
