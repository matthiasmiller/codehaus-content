24.1. Account Groups: "Private" Groups

TODO_: Possible future item: Tim Reitz 10/09/2025: Per conversation with the client today, he thinks there is a chance that there would eventually be a requirement for Groups that are "private" or closed off to other Resellers. Basically, these Groups would fully (and solely) provide support to the Accounts under them, not allowing other Resellers / Group Admins to support or provide Devices to their Accounts. Glen sees this as a possibility, but is not really wanting to encourage it. He thinks there could be alternative approaches. 

One alternative would be to add a note to certain Groups, so that when they are selected for an Account the Reseller sees that "this Account must be managed by a Group representative", and can point the user that way.
