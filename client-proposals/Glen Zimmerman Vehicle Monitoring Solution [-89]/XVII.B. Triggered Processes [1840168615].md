16.2. Triggered Processes

Triggered Processes: The Solution contains the following automatic processes that are initiated via a trigger in the Solution:

  


TODO_VA: list the items based on the template below, or "N/A"

  * Name: __ (Based on what the trigger does) 
    * Description: __ (Brief description of what the import does, but not how it happens or is initiated) 
    * Action(s): 
      * __ (Brief description of what each included .x30 or .r20 does, followed by the .x30 / .r20 name in parenthesis - usually can be set to "TBD" in the initial spec, with a note for the developers to determine this and for us to document it after coding) 
    * Trigger Name (to be enabled at deployment): __ (TBD in coding) (This is the name of the Database Trigger to be set up - usually can be set to "TBD in coding" in the initial spec, with a note for the developers to determine this and for us to document it after coding) 
    * Report Path: __ (TBD in coding) (This is the "Trigger Report" \-- usually can be set to "TBD is coding", with the note below for the developers to determine & for us to document it after coding)
    * Initiated:
      * __ (Brief description of how the .x30 is initiated. Examples (may be more than one):) 
        * When the "__" button is clicked on the __ record.
        * When the "__" field is changed __ on the __ record. 
    * Priority: __ (Set to "N/A", unless there are multiple triggers initiated at the same time by the same action, in which case this determines the sequence) 
    * Run as User: "Administrator" 
    * Import Path: __ (TBD in coding) (This is the "Import Report" \-- usually can be set to "TBD is coding", with the note below for the developers to determine & for us to document it after coding)



  


TODO_VA: (for Proposals) Add a deployment note: "Enable Database Trigger(s)"

  


TODO_VA: Put the following note in Dev Spec if not already noted there: 

TODO_CCI: Please document the Trigger Name, Report Path, and Import Path & let us know, so that we can update the spec accordingly. Thanks!
