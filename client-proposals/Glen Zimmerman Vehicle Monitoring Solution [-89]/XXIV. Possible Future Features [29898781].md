Resellers Supporting Accounts for other Resellers: 

_VA: Tim Reitz 08/14/2025: A Reseller can provide support for Accounts under other Resellers. But should not be able to edit everything.

Tim Reitz 08/14/2025: Would this be based on permissions, or restricted data?

_GZ: Tim Reitz 08/14/2025: What are the specific things that a Reseller can do for another Reseller's Account? 

TODO_VA: Tim Reitz 08/21/2025: Let's put this on the back burner for now. I think we could do this on the Silverloom side (with added complexity), but I'm not sure if/how it would work on the Traccar side. 

Tim Reitz 11/05/2025: Maybe giving the users the necessary permissions on the Silverloom side will work fine -- if the "Traccar Sync" user is the one making the changes in Traccar... 

??TODO_ GZ : Tim Reitz 08/14/2025: Maybe consider limitations on which Resellers' Accounts a Reseller can edit.

  


  


Tim Reitz 11/06/2025: Long-term ideas: 

  * Friend groups / circles of groups 
  * Location sharing with friends / people in friend groups (maybe even "blind location sharing")
