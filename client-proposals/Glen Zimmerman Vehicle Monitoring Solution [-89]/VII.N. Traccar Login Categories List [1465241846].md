7.14. Traccar Login Categories List

  


Requirements

*Done. 

  


Overview: This is a custom non-editable simple list used to set the category / linked record type for Traccar User sync records. 

  


It includes the following items: 

  


  * Account Group Admin
  * Account Member
  * Account Reseller
  * Master Administrator
  * Reseller Rep



  


This list is universal for all users.

  


Note that this sequence is static, so it should always be displayed in this sequence throughout the Solution.

  


This list will be set up by CodeCrafters as part of the main development. If changes need to be made to this list, it will require some coding work.

  


Other Notes: 

  * Note that this list is distinct from the "Contact Roles" list, in that this list determines the broader category / linked record type for the Traccar User record.
