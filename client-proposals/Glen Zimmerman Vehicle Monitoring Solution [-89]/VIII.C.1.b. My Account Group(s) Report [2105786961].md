8.3.1.2. My Account Group(s) Report

  


Requirements

*Done. 

TODO_VA: Tim Reitz 08/26/2025: But if we hide other Groups for non-Master Administrator users, we wouldn't need this version (could simply open the main report from the same menu option). 

  


Overview: This is the "All Account Groups" report, filtered to the current user.

  


Accessed from:

  * Main Menu | Account Group Management | My Groups (opens the report directly, bypassing the filter screen)



  


The following filter(s) are set differently than on the main report:

  * "Group Admin" = Set to the Contact for the current user 



  


Other Notes:

  * N/A
