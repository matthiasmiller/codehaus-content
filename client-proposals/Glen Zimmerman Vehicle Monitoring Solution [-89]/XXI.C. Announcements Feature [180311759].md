21.3. Announcements Feature

  


Requirements

*Done. 

  


The Announcements feature started as an idea for simply documenting basic details about print / direct mail communications that are sent, and grew into a full and robust feature for also mass-sending emails to Primary Account Managers, with the foundation laid for also being able to mass-send emails to other contacts in the future.

  


This is being estimated as an optional add-on, and could be done as part of Phase 1 or at a later point. Note that doing it at a later point could require adjustments to design and/or pricing.

  


Development Specification
