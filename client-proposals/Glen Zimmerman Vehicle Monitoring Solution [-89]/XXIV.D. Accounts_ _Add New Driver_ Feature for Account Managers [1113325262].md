24.4. Accounts: "Add New Driver" Feature for Account Managers

TODO_: Tim Reitz 10/23/2025: Possible future item: Add a way for Account Managers to add a new Driver / set up the user without needing to involve the Account Reseller (separate record type / x30s / etc.). We'd have to take into consideration things like subscription / billing for the new user.
