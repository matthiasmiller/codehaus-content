8.2. Contacts Reports

*Done. 

  


The Solution includes the following reports for Contact records:

  


  


  


_NM: Tim Reitz 10/16/2025: Client wants to limit non-Master Administrators from being able export contacts list. With restricted users, is the whole "Advanced" drop-down menu hidden on reports? (wanting to hide the Excel / PDF options). 

_GZ: Tim Reitz 10/16/2025: Nic looked at this, and we actually don't seem to have a way to hide these options or the Advanced drop-down. Would have to rely on the confidentiality agreement & people's integrity.

Tim Reitz 10/23/2025: Told the client today. 

_GZ: Tim Reitz 10/17/2025: Another option would be to do a customized Contacts report, to hide specific data from non-Master Administrators (so that other users couldn't download the full data set). 

TODO_VA: Tim Reitz 10/23/2025: Per Glen today, he thinks the limited report would be an effective safeguard. 

_GZ: Tim Reitz 10/18/2025: What would be the details that these users could see on a report (giving them enough to work from, but not enough to easily misuse it)? 

TODO_VA: Tim Reitz 10/23/2025: Per Glen today: 

  * Name 
  * City & State  
  * Church Affiliation 



  


_NM: Tim Reitz 10/16/2025: Correct that there's not a way to disallow copying directly from the report screen? 

Tim Reitz 10/16/2025: No.
