16.1. Scheduled Processes

Scheduled Processes: The Solution contains the following automatic processes that are initiated on a scheduled basis (also referred to as "Scheduled Tasks"). 

  


Note that errors from the background processes will be sent to designated users as standard email alerts (if outbound emails are configured). The designated users are set as part of the Scheduled Task setup.

  


 TODO_VA: list the items based on the template below, or "N/A" if none 

  * Name: __
    * Description: __ (Brief description of what the import does, but not how it happens or is initiated; for Scheduled items, this is included on the Scheduled Task as a reference for users)
    * Category: __ (Scheduled Task Category)
    * Notes: __ (Scheduled Task Notes)
    * Initiated: __ (Note frequency (including daily/weekly/etc., and date/day of week), and time - see a Scheduled Task for examples of options)
    * Should Wait On: __ (Scheduled Task - usually N/A; checkbox + droplist)
    * Commands:  __ (Scheduled Task Command Line(s) - usually can be set to "TBD" in the initial spec, with a note for the developers to determine this and for us to document it after coding)
    * Prompts: 
      * __ (List of prompts that drive the .x30, or "N/A" if none) 
    * Action(s): 
      * __ (Brief description of what each included .x30 or .r20 does, followed by the .x30 / .r20 name in parenthesis - usually can be set to "TBD" in the initial spec, with a note for the developers to determine this and for us to document it after coding)
