14.1.2. SMS & Email Notifications from Traccar

DONE_JB (research): Tim Reitz 12/15/2025: Would you look into what it takes to set up SMS sending from Traccar? 

Tim Reitz 12/23/2025: Here are some notes from Traccar: [https://www.traccar.org/notifications/](https://www.traccar.org/notifications/). 

TODO_VA: Jonathan Bergen 01/21/2026: It looks like they support Twilio, ClickSend, and BulkSMS. [https://www.traccar.org/http-sms-api/](https://www.traccar.org/http-sms-api/)

  


DONE_JB (research): Tim Reitz 12/15/2025: Would you also look into what it takes to set up email sending from Traccar? I think it might just "happen", but I'd like to confirm. What email address shows up as the "From", and is it something that Glen can customize?

Jonathan Bergen 01/21/2026: It'll be a single email address for the Traccar server, so I would envision something like "[notifications@glenssoftware.com](mailto:notifications@glenssoftware.com)". It can be set to whatever his email will be.
