33.1. Restricted Data Policies

Overview: Restricted Data Policies can be accessed and configured via Advanced | Admin | Configure Restricted Data Policies. This is an additional tool that can be used to restrict or allow access to certain features in the Solution. 

  


Once a Policy is configured, it can be selected on a User Group record to apply it to all users of that Group. 

  


Note that these Policies can be edited manually in the Solution, so they may become out of sync with this spec if changes are not communicated and documented. 

  


The following are configured in the Solution: 

  


_NM: Tim Reitz 12/16/2025: Any needed for Phase 1? 

_VA: Tim Reitz 12/18/2025: Nic thinks that we're planning to phase out Restricted Data Policies because they are so slow. So let's remove this section + remove it from the Snippet. 

: If yes: Fill out the following details as needed (copy and create new iterations if multiple Policies are needed): 

Policy Name: __ 

Filter By: __
