24.15. Integration with WMVAP Software

Tim Reitz 09/12/2025: There could be multiple types / directions for integration: 

\- High-level integration to report whether a certain person has an account with the Vehicle Tracking service, and therefore would be eligible for a discount on their Premium. 

\- Specific reporting on the driving activities of a certain person, for a specific timeframe. 

\- Requesting a driving report on a certain person. 

  


  


_HLD - Be a designation in there to have driver scores pushed back into Weaverland -- would assume -- 

Could be part of the incentivizing -- here is the rate w/ and the rate w/o

_GZ: Tim Reitz 07/23/2025: We have this note from the HLD. What do we mean by "driver scores"? 

Tim Reitz 07/24/2025: Plan to discuss this with a deeper dive into Events. 

TODO_: Tim Reitz 09/12/2025: Per the client today, this would at least be a Phase 2 item. Data would be tied into the VIN + Driver name. 

\- Would be a setting that could turn it on / off, can be set by a Master Administrator or a Group Admin. 

\- There would be a set frequency for syncing the data. 

\- Maybe a set timeframe (i.e. "we want to see the next 6 months of data for this invidiual"). Possibly could self-expire when the end data arrives. 

\- Regarding consent from the individual: 

[ ] Client is hoping/assuming that the user agreement would be a blanket statement to cover sharing data for certain purposes. 

[ ] Internally, there would a process of checks and balances to make sure the data is handled appropriately - a request would be logged, etc. 

[ ] Part of the process would likely include consent from the Account Manager (not the Driver). 

[ ] Tim Reitz 09/12/2025: I'm thinking probably a "Data Sharing Request" record with approval checkboxes + dates, verbiage for the acknowledgment, date range, etc.
