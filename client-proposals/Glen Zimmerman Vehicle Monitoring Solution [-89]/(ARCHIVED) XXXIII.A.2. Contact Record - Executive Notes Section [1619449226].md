33.0.2. Contact Record - Executive Notes Section

  


Requirements

  * Executive Notes section (standard; with the following custom visibility: visible to all "Administrative Uplines" of the Contact): 
    * "This Executive Notes section is visible only to administrative uplines of the Contact: Reseller(s), Group Admin(s), and Master Administrators." (custom on-screen message in gray font) 
    * Executive Notes (standard memo)



  


_VA: Tim Reitz 10/15/2025: Actually we need to hide this, since we're hiding the main Notes section (otherwise this will be by itself on the right side). Add a custom "Provider Notes" or "Administrative Notes" with the same details.

Tim Reitz 10/16/2025: "Administrative Account Notes (Visible only to uplines)" (or do the clarifying note in the section)

  


Development Specification

_MOCKUPS: Tim Reitz 10/15/2025: A custom on-screen message.
