*Done. 

  


Overview: This is a custom report of organization Account Reseller Contact records, filtered to the Contacts to which a single Reseller Rep is linked as a Rep.

  


Accessed from: The "For <Reseller Name(s)>" link on the Contact record (when "Is Reseller Rep" checkbox is checked)

  


Title: "Resellers by Rep: <Short Display Name for the Rep>"

  


Preface: "The above Rep is linked to the following organization Resellers:"

  


Columns: 

  * Reseller Name (displays the "Display Name"; link to the Contact record)



  


Row-Specific Buttons: N/A

  


Grouped by: N/A

  


Sorted by: "Reseller Name" (alphabetically)

  


Filters: 

  * Reseller Rep (hidden; drop list of Contacts with the "Is Reseller Rep" checkbox checked; defaults based on the Contact from which the report was opened)



  


Buttons: N/A

Other Notes:

  * This is an "auto-push" report, meaning that if there is only one result when the filters are set, clicking "Continue" will open that record directly, bypassing the report screen.
