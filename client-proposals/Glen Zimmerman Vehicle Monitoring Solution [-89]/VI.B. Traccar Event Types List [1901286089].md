6.2. Traccar Event Types List

_GZ: Tim Reitz 07/23/2025: Is this something that you would add to, or is it static? (or maybe you don't know?) 

Tim Reitz 07/24/2025: Client thinks that these are "baked-in" types that Traccar reports on. He thinks that these are the ones that they had identified as "important". 

I'm thinking this list could be added via import. 

Tim Reitz 01/15/2026: Probably not add via import, actually. We probably want to hard-code which Types are brought in by the import, based on this list. 

  


TODO_JB (research): Tim Reitz 12/30/2025: What are the Event Types in Traccar? [full list]

  


TODO_: Tim Reitz 07/24/2025: To consider: We might filter down the Events that we actually bring into the Silverloom database -- which ones are actually useful / helpful to the Account Managers & Drivers?

Overview: This is a custom non-editable simple list used to track types of Traccar Events. 

  


It includes the following items: 

  * Alarm
  * Command result
  * Device inactive
  * Device moving
  * Device stopped
  * Driver changed
  * Fuel drop
  * Fuel increase
  * Geofence entered
  * Geofence exited
  * Ignition off
  * Ignition on
  * Maintenance required
  * Media
  * Queued command sent
  * Speed limit exceeded
  * Status offline
  * Status online
  * Status unknown
  * Text message received



  


This list is universal for all users.

  


Note that this sequence is static, so it should always be displayed in this sequence throughout the Solution.

  


This list will be set up by CodeCrafters as part of the main development. If changes need to be made to this list, it will require some coding work.
