33.3. Invitation Report(s)

_VA: Tim Reitz 09/17/2025: Add notes & Snippet or deactivate section based on whether we have this record type.

  


  


Tim Reitz 01/15/2026: Note from the "Invitation Record" spec, per conversation with Nic today: Nic doesn't think we need an Invitation record.

We're not giving end users access to Silverloom at this point, and the Welcome email would have what is needed for Traccar and the portal.

Tim Reitz 01/15/2026: Archiving this section today.
