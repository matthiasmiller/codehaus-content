8.2.1.1. Contacts by Reseller Report

  


Requirements

TODO_VA: Tim Reitz 08/26/2025: Filtered version of the Contacts report. Probably a "My Clients" menu option for Resellers, and a "Clients by Reseller" menu option for Master Administrators (and maybe Group Admins?).

  


Overview: This is the "<Service Name> Contacts" report, filtered to __.

  


Accessed from:

  * Providers | Contacts | My Clients (opens the report directly, bypassing the filter screen)
  * Providers | Contacts | Clients by Reseller (opens __)



_NM: Tim Reitz 10/06/2025: opens the prompt screen? Actually maybe use a helper report to open a prompt screen with a single drop list for "Account Reseller", that would then open the main Contacts report filtered accordingly. 

TODO_VA: Tim Reitz 10/06/2025: Yes, helper report with the ask prompt, with an auto-push button that launches the main Contacts report. 

  


The following filter(s) are set differently than on the main report:

  * "Account Reseller": Set to __



  


Other Notes:

  * N/A
