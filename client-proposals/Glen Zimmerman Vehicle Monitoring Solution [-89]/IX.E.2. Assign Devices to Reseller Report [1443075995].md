TODO_VA: Tim Reitz 01/30/2026: "Assign Devices to Reseller" Report. Spec this out. Editable report of Devices with "Status" = "General Inventory", editable column for "Assigned Reseller".

Tim Reitz 01/30/2026: Actually, I'm including assigned devices, in case they want to change the assigned reseller on a device that they haven't shipped off yet, etc. 

[ ] Grouped by: "General Inventory" at the top, then "Assigned Reseller" below that (alphabetical) 

[ ] Probably no filters needed?
