1.6.1. Setting up Users & Accessing the Software

*Done. 

  


Since there are three different pieces of software, this section explains how users can be set up and access each one: 

  


Silverloom: For Phase 1, we are keeping things simple and saying that only Master Administrators can set up and manage all Provider users in Silverloom. 

  * For Group Admins: A Master Administrator sets up a new Group Admin user by creating a Contact record, setting up and linking a User Profile with the Contact, and then checking the "Is Group Admin" checkbox, and sending the login information to the person. After that, other Group Admins can add the new one to Groups. Note that existing Group Admins can request a new Group Admin to be set up. 
  * For individual Resellers: A Master Administrator sets up a new Reseller, parallel to the process for setting up the Group Admin. 
  * For Reps for organization Resellers:  A Master Administrator sets up a new Reseller Rep, parallel to the process for settting up a Group Admin or individual Reseller. The Master Administrator must set the first Reseller Admin on the organization Reseller Contact, and after that Reseller Admins for that Reseller can link existing Rep contacts. Reseller Admins can request a new Rep to be set up. 



  


In the future, we could look at ways to allow Group Admins and Reseller Admins to fully set up other users without needing to request it from a Master Administrator, but for now this keeps things simpler and cheaper (and fewer users are expected stages of using the software). 

  


Note that, as mentioned elsewhere, end users do not have access directly into Silverloom in Phase 1. 

  


Traccar: Contacts who are currently Account Members on an active Account in Silverloom (Account Managers and Drivers) or who are active Providers, automatically have a Traccar login created via the sync from Silverloom. This login access can be disabled from within Silverloom. 

  


For Phase 1, everyone except Master Administrators have very limited editing permissions in Traccar, since the sync overrides most changes made to users, devices, etc. 

  


End User Portal: Contacts who are currently Account Members on an active Account in Silverloom (Account Managers and Drivers) or who are active Providers can receive a login link to access the Portal.
