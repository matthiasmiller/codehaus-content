9.5.1.2. Devices by Group Report

  


Requirements

_GZ: Tim Reitz 10/06/2025: Would a report like this be helpful (maybe to open from the Group page), or are you more likely to look first at Accounts for the Group, then Devices for those Accounts? Note that could you could still get a report like this by filtering on the main "All Devices" report.

TODO_VA: Tim Reitz 10/16/2025: Per Glen today, the Account or Driver/user are the most important data points. Vehicles would also be important for searching/looking up based on complaints, etc. 

We probably don't need this "Devices by Group" report. Instead focus on:

[ ] "Accounts by Group" (maybe with a second pane for devices), and 

[ ] searching for Account, Driver, and Vehicle

  


Overview: This is the "Main Devices Report", filtered to include Devices for a single Group.
