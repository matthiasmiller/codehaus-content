10\. Outbound Emails

The Solution sends the following outbound emails. Some are sent via the "mailto" feature on the browser, opening an email draft in the user's default email client, with various things defaulted, and some are sent automatically by the software (requiring SMTP settings to be configured).

  


  


  


_GZ: Tim Reitz 09/01/2025: Would you have a specific email for outbound emails?

Tim Reitz 09/04/2025: Per the client today,

\- Good to have some generic one(s): support@ / billing@ or accounts@ /

\- For communications coming from a specific person, use that person's email

\- when able, have it point back to the administrator or the person responsible for carrying out the role:

\- master level: maybe "admin@__"

\- Group / Group Admin level: the Primary Group Admin's email address

\- Account Reseller level: __

\- essentially go up a level in the uplines (either "From" or "Reply To")

TODO_VA: Tim Reitz 01/13/2026: Follow up on notes here as needed. 

TODO_GZ: Tim Reitz 01/13/2026: We're going to need the email addresses at some point in coding. 

  


TODO_VA: Tim Reitz 12/11/2025:  Let's see about BCC'ing an email address so that the service can have a copy of everything that was sent.

TODO_GZ: Tim Reitz 01/13/2026: We'll need this email address from Glen by some point in coding.
