16.2.2. Send "New Account Reseller Transfer Request" Email

TODO_VA: Tim Reitz 01/22/2026: Spec this out. Triggered on the first Save after a row is added to the "Account Reseller History" non-embedded spreadsheet (I think).

Tim Reitz 01/28/2026: Correct - triggered on the first Save after a new row is added (not including the initial row). Note that this includes when rows are added via automatic processes, like the "Request Reseller Transfer (Non-Upline)" x30. 

  


_NM: Tim Reitz 01/28/2026: Question about naming triggers: For all of these triggers that send emails, include "Email" in the trigger name?

TODO_VA: Tim Reitz 01/30/2026: Yes, good to include it. Like I've already specced these.
