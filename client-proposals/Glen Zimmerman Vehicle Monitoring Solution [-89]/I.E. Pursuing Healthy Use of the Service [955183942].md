1.5. Pursuing Healthy Use of the Service

Tim Reitz 10/24/2025: Not sure if we will have a section like this long term, but at least including it for now since it's a discussion that we're having. 

  


_VA / TODO_GZ (ongoing conversation): Tim Reitz 08/13/2025: Discuss concerns / benefits. How to help ensure & promote healthy use of the software? Ongoing conversation.

  


\- What is your level of concern about unhealthy use?

  


\- What are specific concerns that you / we have?

Tim Reitz 08/14/2025: 

- Recognizing: Mainly pertaining to already-unhealthy situations. 

\- Passive use: Ignoring important notifications / warnings events, to the detriment / harm / danger of the users. Relying on the tool to do the work itself. 

\- Controlling/manipulative use: Threatening, using the tool / information to control / manipulate / coerce the users. 

\- Legalistic use: Using the tool / accountability as an end in itself; relying too heavily on the guardrails / control; not addressing the heart; not pursuing healthy training & discipleship. 

  


Tim Reitz 10/27/2025: In all of this, I don't want to use the same unhealthy approaches / tactics to counter the unhealthy use of the software. That would be a sad and ironic outcome. But it's entirely possible - using those approaches to accomplish (legislate / cause) a certain desired good outcome. 

  


TODO_ EM: Tim Reitz 10/27/2025: Would there come a point in use where you would no longer feel comfortable with CodeCrafters continuing to support the solution? (extreme control / manipulation / illegal/unethical tracking) Would it be wise to bake something in here? Obviously the legal line is something that the Service would have to face first, but are there more nuanced lines that we would not tolerate? 

  


\- What does healthy use look like?

Tim Reitz 08/14/2025: 

\- Using it as a tool. 

\- Healthy conversations, training, and discipleship toward living a life that honors God. 

\- Addressing the heart issues in a loving way. 

  


\- How can we help ensure & promote healthy use?

_VA: Tim Reitz 08/14/2025: Ideas from conversation with Ellis: 

[ ] Provide / access to materials & helps (List of resources (perhaps in the Wiki). This could include Anabaptist counseling centers, books, etc.) 

_GZ: Tim Reitz 10/27/2025: Thoughts on this? 

TODO_VA: Tim Reitz 10/30/2025: Glen was on board with this. Let's put together an initial list of sample resources to share with the program. 

Tim Reitz 01/28/2026: Here's an initial list: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xrUeJ64hBFsdLc7LgT_f5MdYPYYaO_C2sduH1ccENcs/edit?tab=t.0](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xrUeJ64hBFsdLc7LgT_f5MdYPYYaO_C2sduH1ccENcs/edit?tab=t.0). 

[ ] Requirement for counseling / coaching (at least for certain situations) (for Group Admins & Resellers, in the area of __) 

TODO_GZ : Tim Reitz 10/27/2025: Thoughts on this? 

_VA: Tim Reitz 08/14/2025: A few ideas from brief discussion with the client today: 

[ ] Channel for the end user to request help if things are controlling/manipulative 

_GZ: Tim Reitz 10/27/2025: To whom should this request go? Could this request even go to a designated outside / 3rd party that could serve as a mediator? 

_VA: Tim Reitz 10/30/2025: A lot of times it would be the Group Admin, but there might be times when it would need to be someone outside of that (probably a designee / advocate from the Church Affiliation - could have an optional "End User Advocate" field on the Church Affiliation). When a user requests help, the email would go to the Master Administrator / Group Admin / Advocate. 

_VA: Tim Reitz 12/31/2025: We need to spec out what the Account Advocate / End User Advocate feature would look like. Presumably something like: 

[ ] A role checkbox on the Contact record: "Is __ Advocate" 

[ ] A way to assign an advocate to an Account 

TODO_GZ: Tim Reitz 12/31/2025: Thoughts? One advocate for the whole system/service, or multiple? 

[ ] Perhaps validate that a Reseller / Group Admin cannot be an Advocate? 

TODO_GZ: Tim Reitz 12/31/2025: Thoughts? 

[ ] 

  


[ ] Check-ins from higher up if alerts are being ignored 

_GZ: Tim Reitz 10/27/2025: What would this look like?

TODO_VA: Tim Reitz 10/30/2025: Probably Group Admins. 

Tim Reitz 01/19/2026: But how would we know if alerts are being ignored? We probably need to spec out alerts a bit more. 

[ ] Periodic reports on improvement 

_GZ: Tim Reitz 10/27/2025: What would this look like?

Tim Reitz 10/30/2025: From discussion with the client today: 

[ ] Periodic (weekly?) email to the end users with a summary of driving activity, highlighting positive and negative items & trends

TODO_VA: Tim Reitz 01/19/2026: How would we track these things? We probably need to spec out alerts a bit more. 

[ ] "Good work, you've made progress!" 

[ ] Maybe have color-coded headers (green for positive, yellow for negative) 

[ ] Could include a link to request help 

[ ] If trend changed from negative to positive, include a note that "we've also notified your Account Managers of this positive trend!" 

[ ] Track trend, but also comparison to their "average" 

[ ] Could even include things like MPG, etc. 

[ ] Future item: Setting goals for scores, with the system sending acknowledgment when they meet that goal. 

  


TODO_VA: Tim Reitz 01/28/2026: Email Mark: 

  


Hi Mark, 

  


I hope this finds you doing well! It feels like it has been a long time since we connected (I think since Montana, when you dropped Aldine and me off at the airport after the men's retreat in 2024). I would love to connect again sometime, if the Lord permits! 

  


I'm writing today with a question related to a work project. I do software design for CodeCrafters (owned by Ellis Miller, who used to be with DNI), and we're working on a project that has potential to be a powerful tool, either for legalism/control/behavior modification/strain in relationships or for healthy boundaries/positive accountability & conversations/heart change. 

  


I've talked with our client about some of the concerns, and they are on board with us putting together a list of resources that could be shared with users of the software to help promote healthier use. 

  


Knowing what I do about your work and your heart for people to live in healing, and your familiarity with the conservative community, I'm wondering what resources you would recommend -- counseling centers, courses, books, etc. 

  


Thanks! 

Tim

As with any useful tool or resource, this software solution has great potential for both good and harm. Through healthy use, it can serve as a tool to promote good vehicle care & maintenance, positive behavior change, healthy conversations, and even God-honoring heart change. On the other hand, unhealthy use can result in it becoming a tool for behavior modification (without the heart change), unhealthy strain in relationships, and ___.

  


CodeCrafters and <Service Name> share a desire for this tool to be used in a healthy, God-honoring way, and are incorporating various safeguards and resources to help ensure and promote healthy use:
