9.5.1.1. Device Search Report

  


Requirements

*Done. 

TODO_VA: Tim Reitz 10/04/2025: Unless we need to restructure how the search mode works for General Inventory Devices. 

  


Overview: This is the "Main Devices Report", in "Search Mode".

  


Accessed from:

  * Providers | Devices | Device Search (opens the filter screen, allowing the user to search for a Device based on the filter options)



 

The following filter(s) are set differently than their defaults:

  * "Search Mode": Set to checked



  


Other Notes:

  * This allows all Resellers and Group Admins (i.e. users without the "Edit General Inventory Devices" Permission) to view results that include "General Inventory" Devices.
