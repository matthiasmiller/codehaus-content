24.11. Vehicles: Make License Plate Conditionally Required

*Done. 

  


We could make the "License Plate" field required if "Current Owner" is not blank, with an "Override License Plate Requirement" checkbox to be able to bypass the requirement. If the checkbox is checked, then the Reseller for the linked Account (and possibly the Primary Account Manager) would get weekly emails reminding them that the license plate is needed.
