24.11. User Groups: "Edit General Inventory Devices" User Group

_EM: Tim Reitz 09/30/2025: Consider adding another user group for office staff that has the "Edit General Inventory Devices" Permission, to do the initial setup?? Probably something to do down the road. At least making a note about it for now. 

TODO_: Tim Reitz 10/07/2025: Ellis thinks this is a Permission checkbox in a User Group. Let's go ahead with a "bonus" User Group for this.
