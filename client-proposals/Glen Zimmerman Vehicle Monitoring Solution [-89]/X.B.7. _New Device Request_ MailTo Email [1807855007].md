10.2.7. "New Device Request" MailTo Email

Overview: This is an email that can be sent to the Account Reseller for an Account, as a request for adding a new Device to the Account. It is sent via the "MailTo" feature, opening a draft in the user's default email client (app), with the following items defaulted:

  


From: <the email address associated with the user's default email app> 

  


To: <the primary Email address of the "Account Reseller" for the Account from which the link is clicked> (user can set other "To:" addresses in the email draft if desired) 

_GZ: Tim Reitz 10/24/2025: How should this work if the Account Reseller is an organization? Is it fine for it to go to the primary email address, to be dispatched from there? Or do we need to assign a specific email address for user requests? Or do we need to assign reps to accounts (more complicated)? 

Could extra coding wait until a future phase / enhancement? 

TODO_VA: Tim Reitz 10/30/2025: There are pros & cons to assigning specific Reps / agents. Initially, it's simple to add the Rep field to the Account (optional). But there are ripple effects (how/when to change the Rep, what to do if the Rep is out of the office or non-responsive, etc.). 

For now, let's just send it to the Reseller's Primary Email address. 

  


CC: N/A (blank, to be set by the user in the email draft if needed) 

  


BCC: N/A (blank, to be set by the user in the email draft if needed) 

  


Subject: "New Device Request for Account #<"Account #">" (user can edit in the email draft if desired) 

  


Body: <text specified in "New Device Request Email Body" in Silverloom Settings> (user can edit in the email draft if desired) 

  


Other Notes:

  * N/A
