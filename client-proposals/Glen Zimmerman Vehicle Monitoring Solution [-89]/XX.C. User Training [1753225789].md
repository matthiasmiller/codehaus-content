19.3. User Training

CodeCrafters will provide support and training for primary users (Master Administrators, and possibly some initial Group Admins and Account Resellers), throughout the deployment of the software. 

  


This proposal assumes a total of up to _10_ hours of support & training time during the deployment process. Additional time beyond that may be billed on a per-hour/T&M basis. 

TODO_: Confirm / set # of hours 

  


Primary users may be given access to the dedicated test system prior to deployment to allow for practicing and learning the system. 

  


Final details are to be determined, but this may include Zoom calls, recorded video walkthroughs, phone calls, emails, and/or written documentation.
