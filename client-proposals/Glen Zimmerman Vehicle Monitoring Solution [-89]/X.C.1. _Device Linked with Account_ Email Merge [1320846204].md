10.3.1. "Device Linked with Account" Email Merge

Overview: This is an email merge that is sent automatically to Account Managers when a Device is linked to an Account that they manage. This email is sent via the "Send "Device Linked with Account" Email" automatic process on the first Save after "Account" has been changed on a Device record.
