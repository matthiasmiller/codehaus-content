Requirements

TODO_VA: Tim Reitz 01/20/2026: Idea from Jisan today for estimating progress: Have a "Complexity" rating / weighting for each row (drop list of 1-10), and calculate from that + number of RG rows with a weighting + "Done" checkbox. We could calculate a total project complete percentage.
