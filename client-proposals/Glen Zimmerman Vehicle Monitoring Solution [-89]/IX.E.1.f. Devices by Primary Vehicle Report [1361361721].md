8.5.1.6. Devices by Primary Vehicle Report

TODO_VA: Tim Reitz 12/09/2025: presumably a "Primary Vehicle for Devices" report. Device records for which "Primary Vehicle" matches. 

Tim Reitz 01/15/2026: Actually calling this "Devices by Primary Vehicle", to be more consistent with other reports in the solution. Probably a filtered version of the main Vehicles report.

Auto-push. Opened from the "Primary Vehicle for <X> Devices" link on Vehicle records.
