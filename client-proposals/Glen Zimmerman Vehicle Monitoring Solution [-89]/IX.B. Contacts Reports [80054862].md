9.2. Contacts Reports

*Done. 

  


The Solution includes the following reports for Contact records.

  


Note that there are two distinct categories of reporting for Contacts:

  * Master Administrator / "Full Access" users can view the Silverloom standard Contacts report, which includes many details.
  * Other users view limited reports, which do not include as many details, to help prevent inappropriate use of Contact data from the Solution.
