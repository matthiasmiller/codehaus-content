Title: Configure Wiki Categories

  


Column(s): 

  * Display Name (link to record; displays the category's name preceded by the hierarchy; standard column)



  


Grouped by: N/A

  


Sorted by: Display Name (alphabetically)

  


Filters: 

  * N/A



  


Buttons: 

  * New Category (opens a blank new Wiki Category record; standard) 



  


Menu Visibility: Same visibility as the "Configuration" menu section, based on the "ShowAdvancedConfigMenu" System Switch (standard). 

Tim Reitz 09/17/2025: I'm thinking we probably should have the Configuration section be visible only to Master Administrators. 

_NM: Tim Reitz 09/17/2025: [The above System Switch is just Yes/No.] How do we control who can see the whole Configuration section? 

Tim Reitz 09/25/2025: Right now it is solely based on the System Switch, no user-level restrictions. We could add a custom macro to do this. 

Or, maybe we hide the whole Advanced Menu for end users, then disable the Configuration menu options for Resellers, Group Admins... [this latter option could work well if we're providing alternate ways for end users to access their User Profile, which I'm thinking is probably the best approach for user experience / simplicity] 

TODO_VA: Tim Reitz 12/10/2025: Is this still relevant?
