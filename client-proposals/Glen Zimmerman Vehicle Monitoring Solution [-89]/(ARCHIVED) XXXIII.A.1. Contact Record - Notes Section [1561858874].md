33.0.1. Contact Record - Notes Section

  * Notes section (standard; with the following custom visibility: visible to the user for the Contact record and all uplines): 
    * Notes (standard memo)



  


_VA: Tim Reitz 10/15/2025: Let's actually hide this completely for this system. 

_GZ: Tim Reitz 10/15/2025: For the sake of privacy, we're recommending that we don't give the end users any visibility of any Notes fields.

_EM: Tim Reitz 10/16/2025: The client would like to have a notes field visible to the end user after all. For documenting things like upcoming address changes, etc.

Are you OK with adding a custom "General Contact Notes (Visible to End User & Uplines)" section/memo?

Tim Reitz 10/17/2025: Adding this comment/question to the new (tentative) section for the custom memo.
