10.2.4. "New Account Member Welcome" Email Merge

TODO_VA: Tim Reitz 12/30/2025: Add a "welcome email" that sends on the first Save after a new row is added to the "Account Members" RG on an Account record. 

Tim Reitz 01/08/2026: Adding more notes, and breaking out into checkboxes: 

[ ] Sent via the "Send "New Account Member Welcome" Email" triggered automatic process

[ ] Sends to "Traccar Login Email" address for the row. 

[ ] Includes a login link (technically the password reset link) for Traccar, and any necessary instructions for logging in & setting up the account.

[ ] And instructions for logging into Traccar 

[ ] And instructions for accessing the Portal 

[ ] And a note about needing to agree to the EUA

  


[ ] Probably have a memo in Silverloom Settings to specify the email body.

  


Existing note: The email that goes to the new user includes the Password Reset link ([https://x6rildfvs.traccar.com/reset-password](https://x6rildfvs.traccar.com/reset-password)). The end user resets their password with this (they can't get in otherwise, since they don't have the initial password).
