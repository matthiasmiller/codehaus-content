8.9.1. <Service Name> Users by Reseller

TODO_VA: Tim Reitz 12/11/2025: Add a new report for "User Profiles by Reseller" (and maybe "User Profiles by Group), so that Glen can determine if/how to pass along user costs. 

Tim Reitz 01/15/2026: This would be for Silverloom users. If we would start charging for end users as well, we could add that in.
