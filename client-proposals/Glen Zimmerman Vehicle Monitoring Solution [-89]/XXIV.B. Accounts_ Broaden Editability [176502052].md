24.2. Accounts: Broaden Editability

*Done. 

  


In Phase 1, the Account record is only editable for "Upline Provider Roles" users for the Account. In the future, we could consider enhancements such as: 

  * Make some fields editable for other providers. 
  * Add a feature for "Temporary Reseller" permission, where another Reseller can request / claim temporary editing privileges (with a notification going to appropriate parties).
