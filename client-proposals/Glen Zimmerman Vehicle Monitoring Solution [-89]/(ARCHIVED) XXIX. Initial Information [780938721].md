29\. Initial Information

Standard Questions for Each Design: 

  


1\. On a scale of 1 to 10, how important is it to access the software from a mobile device, such as a phone or tablet?  Yes, important, but also from a pc.

 

2\. Do you want to import data from an existing software system or spreadsheets? If yes, what data (i.e. contacts, sales items, invoices, etc.)?   None at this time. All accounts will be created as they are enrolled.

 

3\. We offer two options for login format: A quick login using Gmail/Google accounts, and a username/password login. It can also be set up so that some users use one and others use the other. Which format would you prefer? Most users would access via username/password login so this should be standard.

 

4\. Will you want to restrict access to certain portions of the system from some users? If so, you can be thinking through what groups of users you will want to have and what portions of the system you would like them to be able to access.  Their will be master admin accts, 3rd party admin accts for specific groups of users, Then head of household / Head of business account, then user level access.

 

5\. Do you want to use time tracking for employees? Yes, I could see this useful. So a dongle / app user could be administrated by more than 1 acct. i.e. Head of household & admin of business acct.

TODO_MM: Ben Reitz 07/26/2024: I forgot this question was in here when I copy / pasted them into the email. I actually don't think time tracking will be relevant to this system but he does seem to want something that he's thinking of as "time tracking" so I think it would be good to clarify what he's wanting here.

 

6\. What would you like to call the software solution? Sometimes our clients refer to it with a generic term such as "CRM system" or "our software", but some clients like to give their solution a more specific name. It's nice to give it a name or description that is and easy to use. We don't need this right away, but you can be thinking about this as we get started on the design. Yes, I have been working on some names, didn’t arrive at any yet, but need something simple and descriptive.

  


  


  


TODO_HLD: Add copies of printouts, etc. to the design folder on Drive and link it here: __. (see the "Copies of printouts, reports, etc." email in [[[W0312](https://zch.apphosting.zone/Detail/Edit/2?RecordType=WikiPages&NumberID=-313&)]] - 13. High-Level Design Prep Emails)
