    * Description: __ (Brief description of what the import does, but not how it happens or is initiated) 
    * Prompts: 
      * __ (List of prompts that drive the .x30, or "N/A" if none) 
    * Initiated:
      * __ (Brief description of how the .x30 is initiated. Examples (may be more than one):) 
      * When the "__" button is clicked on the __ record.
      * When the "__" field is changed __ on the __ record. 
    * Action(s): 
      * __ (Brief description of what each included .x30 or .r20 does, followed by the .x30 / .r20 name in parenthesis - usually can be set to "TBD" in the initial spec, with a note for the developers to determine this and for us to document it after coding)
