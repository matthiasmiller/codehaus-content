24.15. Location Sharing for End Users

A feature could be implemented to provide a way for users to share locations with each other. Requests and shares could be sent via text messages to the other individual; if they do not have the app installed, they would be invited to sign up.

TODO_: Tim Reitz 09/08/2025: This would be a Phase 2 enhancement (or later).
