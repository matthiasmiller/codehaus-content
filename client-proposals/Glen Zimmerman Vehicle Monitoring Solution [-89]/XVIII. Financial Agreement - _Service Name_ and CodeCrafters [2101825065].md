18\. Financial Agreement - <Service Name> and CodeCrafters

_EM.: Tim Reitz 07/24/2025: I'm thinking we'll need some kind of financial agreement since the client is planning to work with resellers, etc. At the very least a note to say that CodeCrafters will bill the client for all services, and the client is responsible for billing users / resellers based on the user fees, etc. Thoughts?

TODO_VA: Tim Reitz 01/05/2026: Ellis isn't strongly opinionated. We can include some wording if I think it's helpful / necessary.
