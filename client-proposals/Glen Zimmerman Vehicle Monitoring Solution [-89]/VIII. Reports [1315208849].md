8\. Reports

The Solution includes the following reports, based on records:

  


  


_EM.: Tim Reitz 08/25/2025: Let's consider how to name the "master" reports. Should we use the "All" or "Master" or "Main" prefix?

TODO_VA: Tim Reitz 10/31/2025: Probably move away from "Master". Maybe use "Main" instead... 

  


  


TODO_GZ : Tim Reitz 09/12/2025: What reports do you have in mind for the Silverloom side of things? (this would be an ongoing conversation)

TODO_GZ: Tim Reitz 01/23/2026: Fine for the more in-depth, or at least the graph-based, reporting to happen as "Phase 1.2" or Phase 2? 

TODO_VA: Tim Reitz 10/09/2025: 

[ ] Master Administrators: 

[ ] Statistical dashboard for active records (this could actually trickle down to the Group Admins & Resellers, to see stats under their management):

    * Total # 
    * Total # Bar graph by Business / Personal  
    * Total # Bar graph(?) by State

    * Total # 
    * Pie chart of status

[ ] Events / alerts by Region (is there a high concentration of stuff happening within a certain region) 

TODO_VA: Tim Reitz 10/30/2025: Let's see if we can keep a lot of this in Traccar, to avoid bringing tons of data into Silverloom. 

Tim Reitz 11/20/2025: We could try giving a link to a report in Traccar, like [https://x6rildfvs.traccar.com/reports/summary](https://x6rildfvs.traccar.com/reports/summary). 

Or maybe we will bring in certain Events... 

[ ] Events / alerts by Group (concentration by Group) 

TODO_VA: Tim Reitz 10/30/2025: Let's see if we can keep a lot of this in Traccar, to avoid bringing tons of data into Silverloom.
