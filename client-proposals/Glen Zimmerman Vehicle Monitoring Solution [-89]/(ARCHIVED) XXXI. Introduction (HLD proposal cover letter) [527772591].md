31\. Introduction (HLD proposal cover letter)

Dear Glenn, 

  


We're excited about your vision for vehicle monitoring software that can help facilitate safe driving and protect families and others. We would be delighted to partner with you in this goal.

  


At CodeCrafters, we partner with growing businesses and organizations to provide reliable software solutions that empower organizations to do good things even better. We have been working with businesses and organizations like yours for over a decade. The software solution is provided with the Silverloom Business Suite, an enterprise software platform that has been used by large and small organizations for over 25 years. 

  


In the past month, we have gone through the High-Level Design process with you to determine the scope for the solution and to establish the framework for the system design. This document provides an overview of the system. 

  


To continue developing the solution, we are proposing an In-Depth Design. This process takes what we have done together in the High-Level design and drills into the details for a full technical spec. As part of this process, we will provide screen mockups and wireframes of all pages for the web application and the back-end management system. Along with the design, we will provide an estimate for T&M development as well as a fixed-cost proposal to allow you to choose the pricing method of your choice.

  


We would be honored to work with you.

  


Please let us know if you have any questions or how we can assist you.

  


Sincerely,

Ellis Miller

CEO

CodeCrafters USA, Inc.
