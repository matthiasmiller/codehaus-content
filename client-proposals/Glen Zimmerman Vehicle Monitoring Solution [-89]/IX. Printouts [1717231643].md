9\. Printouts

  


Requirements

*Done. (except for the service name references) 

  


The Solution can generate various printouts based on templates. Unless otherwise noted, all printouts contain the standard "Powered by Silverloom Business Suite" footer.

  


These templates/printouts can fall into two main categories: 

  


Basic printouts can be generated from the Advanced menu of a report. Note that the PDF versions of such printouts can be branded with the <Service Name>  logo and contact information but do not have any additional special customizations. Basic Excel files do not include the logo/branding.

  


Customized printouts are provided for various reports and/or records. CodeCrafters will take some liberty with the design of these printouts to simplify development and to compensate for technical limitations. Customized PDFs can include a complete <Service Name> letterhead, and customized Excel printout/files can also include the logo.

  


Other Notes: 

  * Unless otherwise noted, all PDF templates are generated for "Letter" size paper (8.5" x 11").



  


The Solution generates the following printouts: N/A - no printouts are included in Phase 1, other than the default ones generated from reports.
