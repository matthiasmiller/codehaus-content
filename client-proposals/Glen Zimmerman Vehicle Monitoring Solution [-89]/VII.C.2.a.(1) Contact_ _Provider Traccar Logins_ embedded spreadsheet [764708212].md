7.3.2.1.1. Contact: "Provider Traccar Logins" embedded spreadsheet

TODO_VA: Tim Reitz 01/20/2026: I'm thinking an RG similar to the "Account Members" RG (with the same synced fields, etc.). Could have multiple rows since the same provider could wear multiple hats (Reseller on his own / for a company, plus a Group Admin for a Group...).
