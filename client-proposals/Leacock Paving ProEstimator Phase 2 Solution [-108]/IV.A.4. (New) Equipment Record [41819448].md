4.1.4. (New) Equipment Record

  


Requirements

This is a possible record type, TBD in the In-Depth Design. It would be used to track equipment for jobs / scheduling purposes, like the Truck Record and Trailer Record.

  


Development Specification

Mockup: N/A (not needed) 

  


Tim Reitz 12/03/2025: This is a bit unclear, but I think they want something like this.

Matthias Miller 12/03/2025: Possibly, but they were able to produce zero information about how they're wanting to actually use it.

  


  


Matthias Miller 12/04/2025: TODO_IDD: Ellis said that maybe Truck & Trailer could be combined into equipment or machinery. (It could be useful to know exactly what they mean when they use the term "equipment".)
