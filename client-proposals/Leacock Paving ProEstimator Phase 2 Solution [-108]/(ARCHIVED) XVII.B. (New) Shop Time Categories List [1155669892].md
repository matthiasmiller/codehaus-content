17.2. (New) Shop Time Categories List

  


Requirements

  * Shop Time Categories (to track different activities tracked as "Shop Time"; list items TBD)



  


_TR: Tim Reitz 12/03/2025: How is "Shop Time" itself configured? Is it a list or a config record?

Matthias Miller 12/03/2025: It's probably simpler, more consistent, and easier to edit as a config record. Only depends what Alvin prefers. No diff to anyone else.

Tim Reitz 12/04/2025: Sounds good. I think we'll do it as a config record then.
