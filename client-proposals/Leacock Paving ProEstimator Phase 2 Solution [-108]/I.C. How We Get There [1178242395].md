1.3. How We Get There

That's the shape of Phase 2 of the ProEstimator solution: from job award to invoice, with scheduling, time tracking, material tracking, and job costing.

  


We're not here to reinvent how Leacock Paving operates. You've built something that works over many years, with good people and solid instincts. What we're here to do is walk alongside you as you make that process digital -- capturing the same information, following the same logic, but with fewer gaps, fewer pieces of paper to chase, and fewer hours spent reconciling at the end.

  


The sections that follow break down each component in detail: what it does, how it works, and what we'll need from you to build it right. Our goal is that when you finish reading, you'll see your own operation reflected back -- just running a little smoother.
