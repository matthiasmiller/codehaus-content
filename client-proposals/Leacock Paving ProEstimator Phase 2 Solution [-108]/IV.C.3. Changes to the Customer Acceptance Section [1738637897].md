Requirements

This includes the following new items:

  


  * Deposit Received Date (date; details TBD)
    * This flags when the deposit came in, so jobs don't accidentally get scheduled or started before payment is secured.
  * Final Invoicing Date (date; details TBD)
    * This records when the invoice was sent, marking the job as financially closed.
