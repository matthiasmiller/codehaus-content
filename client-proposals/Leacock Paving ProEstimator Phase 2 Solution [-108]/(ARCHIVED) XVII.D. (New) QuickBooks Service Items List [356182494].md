DONE_HLD: Tim Reitz 12/04/2025: I also found the following notes. Does this mean that all Sales Items fall under the umbrella of Service Items? 

  * Service Items
    * Construction Materials
    * Hauling
    * Rentals
    * Jobs

Every item that they have is a service item.

  


DONE_HLD: Tim Reitz 12/04/2025: Also, so that I don't have to come back and ask in the IDD: 

\- Where are these Service Items used in Silverloom (Time Cards, etc.)? 

\- Do they have any purpose / significance in Silverloom other than to give QuickBooks the information it needs?

Matthias Miller 12/04/2025: No purpose except for QuickBooks. I don't think we need this. We just give a report of Standard Hours + Prevailing Hours / Overtime on a per individual basis.

Matthias Miller 12/08/2025: Not doing quickbooks
