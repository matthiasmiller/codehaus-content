_ HLD: Tim Reitz 12/03/2025: Is this a simple configuration record, to assign a color to it (for the calendar)? Or would that be done in the WSGI? Note that we also have spec notes for an Event Types config record already -- see below.

Matthias Miller 12/03/2025: Yes. Archiving this in favor of that one.
