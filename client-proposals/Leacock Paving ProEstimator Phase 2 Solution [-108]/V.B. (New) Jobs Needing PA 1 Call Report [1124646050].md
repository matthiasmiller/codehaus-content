5.2. (New) Jobs Needing PA 1 Call Report

  


Requirements

TODO_IDD: Add the Snippet for non-editable reports & start speccing it out based on these HLD notes.

  


TODO_IDD: Tim Reitz 12/03/2025: Is this based on Proposals or Calendar Events? I'm thinking the latter.

  


This is a report of open jobs needing 1 Call. This qualifies as any scheduled work days (any day from start to end of job) in the next 10 days where there's no certificate requested OR the certificate will have expired.

  


  * Columns:
    * Job Name 
    * Job #
    * Job Scheduled Start Date



  


Additional details to be determined in the In-Depth Design.
