5.5.1. (New) Time by Job Report

  


Requirements

This is probably a custom report of time tracked on a single job. 

  


This could be used as a report to inform the job costing work that is done outside of ProEstimator (since job costing is not being included in Phase 2). 

  


Additional details to be determined in the In-Depth Design.

  


Development Specification

Mockup: 

Tim Reitz 12/04/2025: N/A for the HLD.

  


  


TODO_IDD: Tim Reitz 12/18/2025: Note about job costing from conversation with Alvin today: For job costing they just need to know the total hours. This might be this report, or it might be (based on?) the Payroll Report, or it might be a different report.
