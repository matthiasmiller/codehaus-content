16\. High-Level Design Pricing Estimate

  


Requirements

In-Depth Design and Development

CodeCrafters has reviewed the High-Level Design that we put together for your software solution. Keep in mind that the final quoted price would come after the completion of an In-Depth Design, and could be higher or lower than this, or somewhere around what we're thinking now, depending on how all the details work out. Based on the information we gathered in the High-Level Design, we are anticipating this to be in the $45,000 - $65,000 range for In-Depth Design, development, and deployment of this solution. 

  


If this looks higher than what your budget would allow, we could potentially reduce cost and scope in one or more ways, such as starting out with only a few features and adding others as time goes on, or simplifying various parts of the solution. We're committed to giving you high value with whatever you move forward with, and we'd be glad to discuss this with you on a call if you have any questions.

  


We would like to invite you to enter the In-Depth Design phase to finalize the system design. The In-Depth Design will include:

  * Reviewing the High-Level Design and adapting it to any updated requirements
  * Revising and completing all mockups and wireframes for the system
  * Complete technical specifications for the entire system
  * Coding an interactive test UI for the entry of items on the proposal record
  * Providing a more specific price estimate for the development of the software



  


Maintenance and Support

Also, as with building a house or buying a vehicle, there are ongoing maintenance expenses to make sure the software keeps working well for the long haul. When we build a software solution, we provide ongoing support and maintenance that includes the following:

  * System hosting
  * Regular backups
  * Monitoring
  * Unlimited U.S.-based phone support
  * Up-to-date system documentation
  * Security updates and bug fixes
  * Enhancements to the Silverloom platform
  * Design for minor system change requests



  


Industry standards show that software maintenance typically has an annual cost of about 10-25% of the original investment. This phase will increase your current maintenance costs for Phase 1 by $6,500 per year (or $650 per month) based on our current defined scope.

  


Note that per-user pricing for app-only users is to be determined. This may be the same or less than the ProEstimator users. This would

  


Pricing Breakdown

Description| Amount| Additional Notes  
---|---|---  
High-Level Design (HLD)| $3,500| Already invoiced  
Anticipated In-Depth Design ("IDD") & Development cost | $45,000 - $65,000  
| To be refined and finalized at the conclusion of the IDD. Generally includes IDD, coding, extensive QA testing, and deployment; broken down as follows in the next 4 rows:   
Acceptance / IDD Payment| $5,000| Due to start the IDD  
Progress Payment 1| 40% of anticipated  development cost| Due to start coding (after the conclusion of the IDD)   
Progress Payment 2| 40% of anticipated  development cost| Due to start testing  
Deployment Payment| Remainder of final cost| Due upon deployment  
Ongoing maintenance| $6,500/year or $650/month| In addition to the maintenance costs for Phase 1  
Monthly hosting & user fees| TDB| Based on per-user pricing and number of users for Phase 2 features
