Development Specification

TODO_IDD: Tim Reitz 12/12/2025: Think through User Groups and Permissions for Phase 2. For Phase 1, we're putting Matt in the "Full Access" User Group, since he's essentially running the pricing side. For Phase 2, let's look a segmenting the permissions / user groups a bit more. Perhaps it's expanding the "Senior / Pricing Users" group to give it access to the Sales Rep Goals, setting up new sales rep users, etc. (maybe would call it "Sales Manager Users" or something like that).
