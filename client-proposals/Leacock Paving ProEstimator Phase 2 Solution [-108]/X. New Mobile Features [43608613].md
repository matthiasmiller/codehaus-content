10\. New Mobile Features

  


Requirements

Phase 2 includes the following mobile features, as one or multiple applications.

  


This proposal includes some rough mockups, and you likely will have the opportunity to review prototypes throughout the development process.

  


At a high level, access would look something like the following: 

  * Level 1 users (admins; would also have access to the main ProEstimator software):
    * Scheduling Calendar: Create, view & edit full event details
    * Time Tracking: Track time for self (and probably review & edit & approve time cards for "Laborers") 
    * Change Orders: Create change orders 
  * Level 2 users (foremen; would only have access to the app): 
    * Scheduling Calendar: View full event details, including job packet documents
    * Time Tracking: Track time for self (and probably review & edit & approve time cards for "Laborers") 
    * Change Orders: Create change orders 
  * Level 3 users ("laborers"; would only have access to the app): 
    * Scheduling Calendar: View full event details (maybe including job packet documents, if that makes it easier) 
    * Time Tracking: Track time for self 
    * Change Orders: N/A



  


Development Specification

Tim Reitz 12/26/2025: Today I added the notes about various levels of user access.

Tim Reitz 01/07/2026: Note that foremen maybe actually would have access to ProEstimator, depending on what is decided for Change Order creation.
