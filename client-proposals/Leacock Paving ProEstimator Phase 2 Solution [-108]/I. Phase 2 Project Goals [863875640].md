Tim Reitz 12/15/2025: Client would like to have the IDD complete by March 20, 2026 (per email conversation "Phase 2 Planning").

  


Tim Reitz 12/10/2025: The main goals of Phase 2 are as follows: 

  


  * Job scheduling 
    * Linking with Proposals 
    * Job packets 
    * Reminders to confirm with customers
    * Daily / weekly / monthly schedule views 
  * PA 1 Call planning and tracking 
  * Deposits received tracking 
  * Time tracking 
    * Linking with Proposals/jobs 
    * Tracking prevailing wage time 
    * Mobile time clock app 
  * Prevailing wage tracking on Proposals 
  * Job-specific expense tracking 
  * Change Orders creation for foremen (from app) 



  


Other items initially included in Alvin's original list have been deferred:

  * Job Costing



Tim Reitz 12/18/2025: Confirmed with Alvin today. Let's just have a total labor report per project (with prevailing wage details, hours per person, etc., with totals). For job costing they just need to know the total hours. For payroll they need to know per person. I've added notes in report specs to cover for this.

  * Profit Per Day Calculations



Tim Reitz 12/18/2025: Confirmed with Alvin today. 

  * Syncing with QuickBooks for job expenses 



Tim Reitz 12/18/2025: Confirmed with Alvin today. Let's just do a report. I've added a section for a "QuickBooks Data Entry Report".

  * Change Orders for the foremen (Leacock can give the foremen access to ProEstimator, and they could use tablets in the field or jot down the Change Order on a notepad in the field and copy it over once they get to the office. Or the foremen can ask a Sales Rep to set up a Change Order for them.) 



Tim Reitz 12/26/2025: Per Alvin (email: ProEstimator Phase 2 - High-Level Design Proposal), he would like the following options:

  * Paper Form: Foremen fill out a paper form, which goes to the office where someone enters it into ProEstimator. and 
  * Basic App: App-style interface that the foremen could access from devices on the jobsite. It would set up a Change Order in ProEstimator, and there might be the need for a person in the office to adjust and finalize the Change Order.



We're adding the Change Orders app tool back into Phase 2. 

  


Phase 2 features end at the point of invoicing.

  


TODO_IDD: Tim Reitz 12/26/2025: Per Ellis: In the IDD, stay conscious of what's simple and what's complex, and try to pursue simplicity where possible. Give him the features he needs, but try not to over-design things. Defer or set things as "optional add-ons" for scope creep & extra complex feature.
