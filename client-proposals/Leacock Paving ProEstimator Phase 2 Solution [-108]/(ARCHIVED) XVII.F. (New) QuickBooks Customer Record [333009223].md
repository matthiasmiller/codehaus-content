Development Specification

Mockup: 

TODO_ MOCKUPS: Tim Reitz 12/04/2025: Let's add this mockup. 

  


TODO_ IDD: Tim Reitz 12/04/2025: Presumably a read-only record?

TODO_ IDD: Tim Reitz 12/04/2025: Do we need to call it something other than a "QuickBooks..." record? Don't want to be involved with any copyright infringement...
