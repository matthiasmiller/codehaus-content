1.1. Where You Are

Phase 1 gave you a solid foundation. ProEstimator now can handle your leads, estimates, and proposals in one place -- no more scattered spreadsheets, no more hunting for pricing. Your sales team has what they need to close work confidently.

  


But here's what happens next: a proposal is awarded by a customer. And from that moment forward, things shift back to paper and manual data entry into multiple places.

  


The signed proposal gets printed. Photos get attached to an Outlook calendar event. Someone builds a packet -- a copy of the proposal, quantity sheet, pictures, maybe a PA 1 Call confirmation, maybe a map. That packet goes on a clipboard and heads out with the crew. Time cards get filled out by hand. The foreman tracks material quantities on a sheet that looks a lot like the one you've been using for years. And when the job wraps up, all of that paper comes back to the office where it is pieced back together for job costing and invoicing.

  


This process works. It has worked. But you're often chasing things that don't line up. A deposit that was supposed to come in but didn't get flagged. Time cards that need clarification. Material quantities that need to be matched against vendor pricing. Crews that shifted from what was scheduled. And the clock is always ticking toward the next payday, the next invoice, the next project that's waiting to get on the calendar.

  


What you're looking to build in Phase 2 is a bridge -- from the moment a proposal is awarded to the moment an invoice goes out the door. Not a replacement for how you think about your business, but a digital version of the same workflows your team already knows, with fewer gaps and less paper.
