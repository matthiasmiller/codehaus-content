10.2. Mobile Time Clock App

  


Requirements

This replaces paper time cards, letting employees select their job or shop time, choose a prevailing wage type if applicable, and clock in, with entries flowing directly into the system for payroll and job costing.

  


This is an app that can be accessed from / installed on mobile devices. 

  


It includes the following: 

  * Clock In/Out
    * On a shared device, have then log into Silverloom and give them a link for "Multi-User Time Clock". On a dedicated device require them to enter their email, get a 6-digit OTP with an option to remember their device.
    * Home Screen:
      * If not clocked in, show "Clock In". If clocked in, show "Clock Out" or "Switch Time"
      * On the bottom of the screen, show a list of timeslots with:
        * Start Time
        * End Time
        * Duration
        * Job or Shop Time Category
        * Prevailing Wage Type
        * Edit button with options to split time slots, adjust times, or edit details. Employees can't edit it after it's been approved.



  


  * When Cocking In or Switching Time:
    * Select Job (Customer Name / Job Name / Job Number; default to prior job when switching; include options for Shop Time)
      * NOTE: If someone gets moved in the middle of the day, you need to either have someone in the office add them to the schedule, have the foreman log into the scheduler, or you need to fix it up at the end of the day.
    * Select Prevailing Wage Type (if required; allow adding to the list)
  * NOTE: If it's not too much complexity, let's track latitude & longitude of the device when making entries.



  


  * Approvals:
    * This gives foremen a view of all time cards for their crews, so they can review, correct, and approve entries before payroll runs.
    * Similar to the above. Show the foreman all the time cards for all their crews with an option to approve when they're happy with it.
    * NOTE: Foremen will have access to tablets, but likely not laptops.
    * NOTE: If the entire crew is wrong, the foremen will need to individually correct specific items.



  


  * Downtime
    * Provide a way for foremen to record specific downtime
