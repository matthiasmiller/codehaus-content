5.3. (New) Final Documentation / Mark Ready for Invoicing Feature

  


Requirements

This is a feature for documenting all expenses for a job (time, materials, subcontractor costs, etc.) for invoicing. This also serves as a checklist for the foreman to mark the job as ready for invoicing. 

  


Technical details are to be determined in the In-Depth Design, but could include additional fields on the Proposal record as well as an editable report for documenting the details and marking the project as ready for invoicing. 

  


A feature also could be included to help the secretary ensure that all tickets are accounted for (asphalt plants, job labor, subcontractor signoff, etc.).
