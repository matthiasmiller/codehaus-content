1.2. Where You're Going

The path forward starts with scheduling. Once a proposal is awarded, you need a place to put it on the calendar, assign it to a crew, and attach everything the team needs to do the job. Right now that's Outlook plus printed packets. In Phase 2, that becomes a job screen tied directly to the proposal data you've already entered. Crew calendars. Job packets accessible on a tablet. Photos, documents, PA 1 Call confirmations -- all in one place, all without printing.

  


Then comes the field. Your foremen need a simple way to record what actually happened each day: who worked, for how many hours, what materials were used, and from which vendors. This isn't about making their lives more complicated. It's about capturing information once, in the moment, instead of reconstructing it later. Time entries flow into the system. Material quantities flow in alongside them. And if something changes on site -- a customer adds scope, an unexpected condition surfaces -- your foremen can initiate a change order without having to call the office and wait.

  


Prevailing wage projects add a layer, and you've thought carefully about how to handle it. The rates vary by county, by state, sometimes by project. What you need is a way to attach those rates to a job at the outset, so when your crew clocks in and selects the project, the right rates are already there. They don't need to see the numbers -- but the office does, and the system should track it automatically for payroll.

  


Job costing is where it all comes together. You've built a straightforward model: invoiced amount minus labor cost (hours times your average rate) minus material cost (quantities times vendor pricing) minus subcontractor costs equals profit. That profit number matters -- your sales team earns commission based on it. What you're looking for isn't a radical change to how you calculate job cost, but a way to pull the numbers together without manually keying everything into an Excel sheet after the fact. Most of it should calculate automatically. And when something looks off, you want to catch it before the invoice goes out, not after.

  


The end point is invoicing. When a foreman marks a job complete, the office should know it's ready. The numbers should be reviewable. And when everything checks out, the secretary puts the invoice into QuickBooks. She puts the payroll into QuickBooks. The system hands off cleanly at the finish line.
