10.3. Change Orders App

  


Requirements

This is a basic app used by foremen to set up Change Orders from the jobsite. This is in addition to their current approach of using paper forms that are entered at the office. 

  


This feature provides an app-style interface that the foremen could access from devices on the jobsite. It would set up a Change Order in ProEstimator, and there might be the need for a person in the office to adjust and finalize the Change Order.

  


Details to be determined in the IDD.

  


Development Specification

TODO_IDD: For the Change Orders feature, consider a Draft checkbox in Silverloom. Also consider whether users should be able to edit Change Orders from the app, or only create.
