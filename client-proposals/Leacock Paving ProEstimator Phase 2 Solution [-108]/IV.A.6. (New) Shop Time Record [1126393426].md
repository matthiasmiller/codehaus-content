4.1.6. (New) Shop Time Record

  


Requirements

TODO_IDD: Add the Snippet for records/details screens & spec it out. Or, copy in the spec of one of the Configuration records from Phase 1 and make changes as needed. The latter option might be the fastest. 

  


This provides categories for tracking time that isn't tied to a customer job but still needs to hit payroll, like shop work or other non-billable activities.

  


Sections and fields: 

  * Name (required; plain text; validate against duplicates) 
  * Active (checkbox) 



  


Sample items TBD.

  


Development Specification

Mockup: N/A (not needed)
