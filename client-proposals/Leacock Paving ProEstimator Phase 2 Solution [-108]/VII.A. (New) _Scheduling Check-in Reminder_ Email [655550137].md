7.1. (New) "Scheduling Check-in Reminder" Email

  


Requirements

This is a follow-up system to remind customers of their upcoming scheduled start date: 

  * For residential customers, remind them every 3 weeks with an update on their scheduled start date. They are mostly 1-time customers.
  * For commercials customers, remind them about 10 days before the scheduled start date. They often do a dozen jobs a year, so there is frequent communication already. 



  


This will be implemented as fields on the Proposal, along with a supporting report.
