10.1. Scheduling Calendar App

This is the central calendar replacing Outlook, showing all crews' schedules with job details so scheduling happens inside the same system as everything else.

  


It has the following three views:

  * Daily (i.e. Dispatch Sheet)
  * Weekly
  * Monthly



  


It also includes a "Job Event" screen.

  


Some or all of these scheduling features would be accessible to all users (at least the basic job information and address).
