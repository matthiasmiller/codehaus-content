3.5. Add Additional Delivery Checkboxes

  


Requirements

Add the following checkboxes to the Quote/Order screen and the Quote/Order printout:

"Truss Delivery" checkbox list: Add two more checkboxes under Set & Drop: 

  * Roll Off 
  * Small Truck


  * These should also be on the printouts. 



  


"Lumber Delivery" checkbox list: Add one more checkbox:  

  * Roll Off


  * This should also be on the printouts. 



  


"Metal Delivery" checkbox list: Add one more checkbox:  

  * Roll Off


  * This should also be on the printouts. 



  


On the printout, the list of Metal checkboxes already fills the available space, and adding one more would be too much to fit. Make the space for the Metal checkboxes taller and shift the contents below down accordingly. 

  


Time Estimate: 1 1/2 days

Tim Reitz 06/29/2021: Per Ellis, estimate: 1-2 days (because of the templates work).
