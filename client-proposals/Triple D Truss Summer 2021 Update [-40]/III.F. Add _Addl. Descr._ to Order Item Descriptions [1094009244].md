3.6. Add "Addl. Descr." to Order Item Descriptions

  


Requirements

Triple D would like to be able to edit the descriptions for items in Lumber and Metal orders (example: for certain posts, they would like to be able to add "fully treated" to the end of the description). 

  


On the Quote/Order detail screen, apply these changes to both the Lumber and Metal order embedded spreadsheets: 

  * Add a new column called "Addl. Descr.". This should be wide enough to show 12 average characters. 
  * Decrease the width of the Description column as needed, but don't decrease it by more than 25% of the existing width (if there are items longer than the new width, the drop list will expand accordingly, but the description will be cut off when viewing the order). 
  * Other columns that could have their width decreased slightly if needed are Inches, More Info, Unit Weight, and Unit Price. 



  


On the printouts (Quote/Order sheets and Packing List): 

  * If there is additional description text for an item, append that to the item description on the printout. 
    * The appended text should be in bold font. 
    * There should be a dash between the original text and appended text. 



  


Time Estimate: 2 days
