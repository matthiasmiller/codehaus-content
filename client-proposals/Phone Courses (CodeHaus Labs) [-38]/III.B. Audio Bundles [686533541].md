3.2. Audio Bundles

The maximum quality for phone class is 8MHz.

  


All audio is converted into 8MHz PCM format (like wav's but with no header) at various speeds (25% intervals from 50% to 200%).

  


This allows easily speeding up and slowing down the audio without needing to process audio server-side, and without taking a lot of storage space.
