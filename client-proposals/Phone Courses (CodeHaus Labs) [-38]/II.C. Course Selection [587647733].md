2.3. Course Selection

Once the user has associated an email or fax with their phone number, check if the directory has more than one course. If so, say:

To access a course, please enter the 3-digit course code. For the course directory, access to your account, or to speak with a customer representative, please press #.

Otherwise, skip this and go straight to the single course.

  


When the user enters a course code, if the course is free, it will automatically be added to the account. If not, it will say:

You have not yet purchased access to "Risk Free Delegation". This course costs $75.

  


If the user already has entered a credit card number, it would say:

To purchase this course using the credit card ending in 1234, please press 1.

To purchase this course using the credit card ending in 2345, please press 2.

To purchase this course using a different card, please press 3.

Otherwise, it would continue to the credit card prompts.

  


When the purchase is complete, it would send the receipt by email or fax.
