2.1. Changes to System Switches

Adding the following new System Switch:

  


  * Label: "Ticket GemWood PO required date" 
    * Code: "TktGWPORequiredDate"
    * Field Type: Date 
    * Description: "Specifies the date from which the GemWood PO ID is required for Delivery Tickets."
    * Value / set to: 10/1/2025  



TODO_: Tim Reitz 09/19/2025: Update this based on the actual deploy date. 

  * Other Notes: 
    * Editable 
    * Note that this is to be set to the date from which a GemWood Purchase Order is required for Delivery Tickets, likely the deployment date for the GemWood PO feature.
