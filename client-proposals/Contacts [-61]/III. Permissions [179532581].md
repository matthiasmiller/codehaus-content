3\. Permissions

Permissions are settings that can be configured for user groups or individual users. They are used to control editability of entire records or specific fields, as well as visibility of and access to records, reports, and menu items.

  


The Contacts module only includes one permission by default: 'Edit the "Contact Type" lookup record'. The permission defaults to only being allowed for administrators. As with other permissions, this can be overridden on a system-by-system basis.
