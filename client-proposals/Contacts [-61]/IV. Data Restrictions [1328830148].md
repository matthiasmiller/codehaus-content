4\. Data Restrictions

Data restrictions are used to prevent access to specific fields or records by users who do not have permission to view them.

The "Executive Notes" field is the only field to be restricted by default on the contact record. The restriction is controlled by the "Executive" permission, which is included in all AppHosting systems and defaults to only being allowed for administrators.
