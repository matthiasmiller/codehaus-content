1\. Overview

  


Requirements

The sales team would like to have a CRM to manage communication with leads and customers. Burkholder Management would also be able to reference this information when dealing with logistics and repairs.

  


This will be built out in multiple iterations. The first phase will be a super lean CRM, allowing for growth and additional features as detailed in "Future Development".

Development Specification

Won't allow you to have two identical names

  * They identify 4-5 fields
    * Name + Phone Number
    * Name + Address
    * And if that happens and you're trying to enter a new one like that -- and it gives you an option to merge with them
