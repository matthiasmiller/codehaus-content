9\. Future Development

We are intentionally leaving Phase 1 simple.

  


For phase 2, we will take a look at:

  * Selecting the phone system
  * Setting up the integration, including a real-time notification for phone calls.
  * Automatically transcribing/recording phone calls
  * Automated tasks (i.e. thank you card after sale)



  


TODO_IN:

  * Do we need to push quote summaries back into the CRM, or can we just have them click through to view the quote?
  * Do we need a way to merge opportunities? We could give an option to close these out as duplicates instead.
  * Do we need a way to split opportunities, such as if you're just closing part of an order? (This can be done by manually creating a new opportunity.) We could give them the option to copy the opportunity and have it blank out some things.
