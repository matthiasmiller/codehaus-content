6.3. Online Leads (Website and Email)

When a new lead is received, search existing contacts for ones that match identically (name, phone, address, and email). If none exist, create a new contact.

  


Create a new opportunity for the lead. To assign the salesperson, look for prior opportunities for a contact matching either Phone Number or Email Address. If such a contact exists, assign the lead to the salesperson for that contact. If not, the salesperson is unassigned and it goes into the general queue for the district.

  


If there are no matching contacts, it goes into the round robin. Find the appropriate district by the website, then send it to the appropriate dealer based on the zip code. If there is no matching zip code, send it to the district round robin.
