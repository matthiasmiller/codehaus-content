To quote from their website:

"You can export your tally files in CSV, XLS or PDF. On demand, we can also generate custom export files depending on your needs.

We can also connect our system with your inventory system through our API. Ask your inventory software partner to contact us and we will take care of this. We chage an additional yearly amount of 2000 USD for this connection."
