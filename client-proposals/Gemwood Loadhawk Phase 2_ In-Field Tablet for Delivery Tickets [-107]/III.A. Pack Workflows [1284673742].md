Expected Packs per Load: usually 6-12 packs per load, averaging 8-9.

  


Workflow Overview:

  * Member receives partially formed load request from GW for thickness, species, and (probably) several grades.
  * Member forms packs for a load request, entering BF and Length for a certain species + grade + thickness, giving an ID.
  * Later, GW receives a real PO and sends it to member.
  * The PO has line items which are filled with packs.
  * Member closes out PO prints BOL. (Note that the PO can be reopened).
