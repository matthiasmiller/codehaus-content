Hardware

Member Devices

  * Look for Android tablets with SIM card compatibility.
  * See [https://www.tallyexpress.com/devices](https://www.tallyexpress.com/devices) for recommended Tally Express devices.



  


Printers

  * Printers for members will be in the office, not the yard. Bluetooth connection for printers would be ideal.



  


Client/solution provider responsibilities:

  * CCI will research hardware and give recommendations to client.
  * The client will purchase and manage set and maintenance of hardware.



  


Note: Let the client know if there are specific requirements for the printer so that the client can provide printers to members.
