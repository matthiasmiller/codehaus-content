2\. Workflows

High-level workflow overview:

  * The member will have a certain number of packs in their yard. When the member loads packs, they have already been identified in Silverloom (stored as pack records).
  * While loading packs onto the truck, the member enters data onto their delivery ticket input record on the device.
  * This data will be synced to a delivery ticket record in Silverloom.
  * Once uploaded, the delivery ticket input should be communicated to ZGW so they can send an invoice to the buyer. ZGW will be notified via an in-app alert. 
    * The office and salesperson will approve the delivery ticket. This is the same as existing behavior.



  


Pack Workflows:

As the lumber comes off the grade line, it is put into packs, which are in-tallied (Tally Express) via auto-calculation based on uploaded picture. The operator only has to insert the pack onto the delivery ticket entry record (preferably via QR code).

  * These packs will be stored as records in Silverloom.
  * The in-tallying provides a quantity of board footage on the delivery ticket so that we can calculate the amount of lumber that was loaded.



  


Member Workflows:

  * Previously, the member received a notification (via a variety of methods, including phone calls) from GemWood that they need to send a load of such and such wood to such and such a buyer. Now, they will simply consult the list of GW POs available to them in the app.
  * On their device, the member selects a GW PO from a list of POs assigned to them. 
  * The member inputs packs onto the delivery ticket input record and saves.
  * The member prints a bill of lading.
