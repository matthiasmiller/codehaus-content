Load Requests

Load requests disappear from the app when they are canceled or assigned to a PO.

  


No manual editing of BF should be allowed; only adding/selecting packs.

  


Q. What packs should be available to select? 

A. Grades will be mixed. Group by species + thickness (probably not grade).

  


Ship to information at the very top, above notes.

  


If a load is reopened, any removed packs need to go back into the pack inventory.
