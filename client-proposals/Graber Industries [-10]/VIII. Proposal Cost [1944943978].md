Support

Multiply Your Strengths provides standard next-business-day email support. This includes answering general questions from the senior users and supporting standard use of the product. Our engineers will typically respond by email or phone by the next business day. If a request goes beyond standard support, requiring additional application customization or premium support, we will offer you that option.

  


For urgent issues, Multiply Your Strengths will provide a phone number for premium support. Premium support is billed at $50 / incident in 30 minute increments. If the issue is found to be caused by a Multiply Your Strengths/AppHosting.zone problem, it will not be billed.

  


Changes and Enhancements

When deploying the system, Multiply Your Strengths will provide the client an opportunity to use the system and provide feedback on features. Multiply Your Strengths will attempt to integrate requested changes as part of the project. If requests go beyond the scope of the project, Multiply Your Strengths will discuss with the client how these should be prioritized.
