1.1. Objectives

Accessible Client Information

The primary goal is to provide the sale team easy access to information in the field:

  * Formulas for recent orders
  * Current account balances
  * Notes about the client
  * Order history



  


Having this information readily available allows the salesperson to serve the client better, collect on accounts receivable, and reduce unnecessary calls to the head office.

  


Route Optimization

Provide the ability to organize clients into routes to reduce time spent on the road and increase time with clients.

  


Customer Check-Ins

Track and manage customer check-ins to ensure customers are visited regularly.

  


Sales Goals

Replace quarterly sales report with real-time feedback to keep salespeople motivated and on-track with annual sales goal. 

  


Streamline back office operations by replacing the quarterly commission process with automatic commissions reporting.
