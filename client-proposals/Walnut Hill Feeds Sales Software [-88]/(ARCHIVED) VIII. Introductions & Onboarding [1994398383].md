Responses from Onboarding and Prep emails:

  


1\. Do you have Zoom or are you able to get it for the design calls? We use Zoom for the audio, video (if our client is comfortable with it), and occasional screen sharing during our virtual design phases. If you can’t join online via the main Zoom platform, you can dial in from a phone for the audio conversation, without downloading or installing anything. If you would like to get Zoom and need help setting it up, you can just let me know. Zoom is fine, I will plan to join the video, but if it doesn’t work out some of time based on my location, I can dial in. 

  


2\. Related to question #1: Do we have your permission to record our design calls? We like to record the calls for reference later on in the project if needed. Only CodeCrafters has access to these recordings, and we can delete them at the conclusion of the development of the project. We can also share the recordings with you if you would like to access them later for your own reference. Yes

  


3\. Would you like access to a Google Doc of call notes from the High-Level Design calls? Yes

  


4\. Who from your team will be joining these calls? We recommend getting the involvement of the main people who would be using the software solution. This might not be for the whole design phase, but at least for the discussions that pertain to the parts of the software that they will be using. If you have managers, a bookkeeper, or others who will be using the software heavily and whose input would be valuable, we welcome their involvement! We can also add them to some or all of the correspondence if you'd like. It will just be me for these calls

  


5\. On a scale of 1 to 10, how important is it to access the software from a mobile device, such as a phone or tablet? 7

  


6\. Do you want to import data from an existing software system or spreadsheets? If yes, what data (i.e. contacts, sales items, invoices, etc.)?   Customer data, order history, account status information

  


7\. We offer two options for login format: A quick login using Gmail/Google accounts, and a username/password login. It can also be set up so that some users use one and others use the other. Which format would you prefer?   Using Gmail accounts would be great – our work emails are provided by Gmail

  


8\. Will you want to restrict access to certain portions of the system from some users? If so, you can be thinking through what groups of users you will want to have and what portions of the system you would like them to be able to access.  Potentially 

  


9\. Do you want to use time tracking for employees?  No

  


10\. What would you like to call the software solution? Sometimes our clients refer to it with a generic term such as "CRM system" or "our software", but some clients like to give their solution a more specific name. It's nice to give it a name or description that is and easy to use. We don't need this right away, but you can be thinking about this as we get started on the design. Ben Reitz 04/23/2024: Client did not respond to this question.

  


Here is the document that they sent over: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t_ZIjKwS2xkeqeUqAHxM2kPYzKDApWQC/view?usp=drive_link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t_ZIjKwS2xkeqeUqAHxM2kPYzKDApWQC/view?usp=drive_link). Note that the system being discussed won't need to take over these functions, but simply needs to collect data from QuickBooks and FOE.

  


 

Solution Name / Subdomain / Client Code: (included in the "Various questions" email in [[[W0312](https://zch.apphosting.zone/Detail/Edit/2?RecordType=WikiPages&NumberID=-313&)]] - 13. High-Level Design Prep Emails)

[ ] Determine a preliminary project name and subdomain (helpful for shorthand reference in the design phase; possibly used the same for reference longer-term)

  * We like to have an internal name to refer to the project. 
    * Choosing this name does not signify any commitment from either side. 
    * For consistency, we like to use the website address where your software solution would be hosting. 
    * The format is something.apphosting.zone. 
    * Sometimes it is: 
      * Simply the name of the business. 
      * The acronym of the business name. 
      * A name that you choose to assign to the software solution.
    * We're looking for something that is short, unique, memorable, and relevant. 
  * Share suggestions prepared as options or conversation starters: 
    * (see HL Design incident)
  * Settled on:
