4.1.3. Permissions

  


Requirements

The Solution will include various custom permissions that control access to/ visibility of various portions of the solution, including reports, records, and parts of records. These permissions are enabled on a per-User Group basis, allowing all users in that group to access the corresponding information.

  


The Silverloom software will include permissions to:

  * View all salesperson commissions
    * Edit all salesperson commissions



  


NOTE: These permissions will be applied loosely by limiting reporting abilities, not with record restrictions.

  


Additional details and other permissions to be determined in IDD.
