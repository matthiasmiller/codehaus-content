1\. Overview

  


Requirements

Walnut Hill Feeds is located in Shelby, OH, and specializes in feed manufacturing. They have 3 areas of business: the feed mill, a grain facility, and several retail stores. These 3 areas of business sell grain and feed across the region. Walnut Hill currently has 5 salespeople, each of whom is covering a large area (about 150-200 prospects each).

  


Walnut Hill uses the following solutions for various aspects of business management:

  * QuickBooks: Used for accounting.
  * NexGen: Used for customer lists, orders, and order management. This is a local solution that salespeople are not able to access from the field.



  


The goal of this Silverloom solution is to create a Sales / CRM software system that would allow the salespeople to quickly access customer data, as well as route planning. The Silverloom solution would integrate with both QuickBooks and NexGen to give the salespeople access to this data from the field.

  


Walnut Hill would also like to do a better job of maintenance tracking, but that is not as big of a priority as the CRM software.

  


This High-Level Design (HLD) proposal provides a general overview of the features that could be included in the Sliverloom Solution. Much more detail would be discussed and specced out in the potential In-Depth Design (IDD).

  


Development Specification

TODO_IDD: Land on a project name + subdomain. Use walnuthill for now, is my proposal.
