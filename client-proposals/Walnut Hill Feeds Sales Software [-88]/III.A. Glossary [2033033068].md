3.1. Glossary

Overview: The purpose of this glossary is to provide a description of key terms, roles, and other things referred to in this proposal. These are listed in alphabetical order below:

  


  * Commission Class - a way of describing the type of commission paid for an order. All orders to Dealers should be grouped under the “Dealer” commission class. All formulas with an overridden commission should use that commission (using the “Other” class). Everything else should use the Formula Search Term / Commission. The Search Term can be the class for those.
  * Formula - an item type that specifies a list of ingredients and amounts
  * Ingredient - an item type that is used to specify the ingredients for formulas



  


  


More items could be added in an In-Depth Design.
