3.5. Configuring Formatting

  


Requirements

Seth Miller 09/02/2025: We do NOT use templates.

  


The AppHosting.zone settings will include an editable template that will be used to generate the directory:

  


  * Household Entry Template (referencing Head of Household record)



  


The templates can be edited by the client or by CodeCrafters in the future. CodeCrafters will work with the client to ensure that the templates are specified correctly during deployment.

  


These will be visible with the "Can view/edit Church Directory" permission.
