1\. Overview

  


Requirements

The Early Childhood Council (ECHO) provides screenings and referrals for preschool-aged children. These children will come on-site to receive a screening to evaluate their current development, vision, hearing, etc. Based on these and other factors, they may be eligible for additional services.

  


ECHO needs to be able to track this information not only for their own purposes, but also to secure additional funding from the state. (One example is the report that details the risk levels of the children within the local community.)

  


They have an existing Django database that is running on a severely outdated version of Python and Django. They would like to upgrade to a more robust system that allows additional reporting tools without the security hazards of the outdated system.
