12.4. Job Calendar

TODO

  


From Lindsay: "I've seen our IN/ MI district schedule up to 10 repairs in a day, but typically we wouldn't schedule more than 5 for repairs in OH and NC (given that they were close in proximity and simple repairs). 

  


 All of my current haulers max out at 4 buildings per load, so no more than 4 stops."

  


  


  


Stages from Lindsay: "Sure thing!  The ones we use in the scheduling of repairs process are:

  


Confirmed

Job Moved- Follow up needed

Left Message

Needs Scheduled

Unable to contact

Urgent

No Further Action Needed

Return Call Needed

  


  


The other labels are used during the invoicing process once the job has been finished, and the card is moved to the "completed" board.

  


Let me know if I can provide any further clarification!
