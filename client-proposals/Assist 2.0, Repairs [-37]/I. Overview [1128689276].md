1\. Overview

  


Requirements

Burkholder Transport handles all the repairs and deliveries for all buildings built by InSight. Any repairs or moves done for other buildings are billed separately and individually.

  


Inbound Work Orders

Work orders come from one of two places:

  * An email from Compass
  * A submission through the Dealer Portal



  


Scheduling

From there, all the orders get scheduled using the same scheduling tools as hauling.

  


Customer Confirmation

Once they've identified the route, call the customer to let them know it looks like they have a repairman in their area on this day. Give a morning vs. afternoon time frame, and let them know they'll get a call from the repairman 30-60 minutes before

  


Repairman

The repairman will track:

  * Used supplies (as notes; get translated over into SKUs)
  * How long it took to get there
  * How long he spent on the job
  * How long to get back from there (on the last job)
  * Pictures of completion



  


These pieces are currently manually entered in.
