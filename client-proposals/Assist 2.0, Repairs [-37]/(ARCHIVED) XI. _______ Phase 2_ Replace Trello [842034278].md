11\. >>>>>>> Phase 2: Replace Trello

Matthias Miller 07/16/2021: My thought with the JavaScript routing API is to have something that would:

  * pull a list of addresses / lot/lang
  * render each of the address cards



  


I think we can go back to Google Maps. They allow up to 25 stops. If we need more than that, we can do multiple routes on a single map, but make it look like a single route, OR....we can simply have multiple maps/schedule

  


The interface I'm thinking is something like we had with the TS routes:

  * Unscheduled



  


  


Matthias Miller 07/16/2021: Can we just generate the links into Google, have them reorder there and get the times they want, then do a future iteration where we show times?

  


Matthias Miller 07/15/2021:

  


Get a lot of aspam that aren't actually builder orders that need to be done

  * Weekly meeting
  * With stephanie and robert



  


They've been putting a lot of legwork into making sure that they're theirs, and if they don't receive it by email to this board, and believes that those are coming through compass to the burman account

  


  


Once they have verified that it's their workorder...

  * Clean it up the formatting up a little bit
  * Then send it to the apporpriate board
  * Boiards by State



  


They hvae the ability to see the address and see a map view

This is EVERYTHING right now, but if she could differentiate between PENDING and NOT...if she could just see a mpa of Tuesday, that would be amazing for her.

Another feature would be that she has to individually route each of these. If there were a way to see

Especially when trying to schedule overnights, or trying to get to see how many in a day --

Typically budgest an hour per stop, usually evens out -- gets it pretty close.

  


Once they identify a grouping in an area, contact customers, confirm repairs, get more inforamtion, get pictures, etc

  


Labels for:

  * Confirmed
  * WAITING FOR THOSE TO COME IN BY EMAIL



  


They have cards going back and forth to another, and if labels are on that board, it imports the labels

  * THis happens if they have a return repair, something got marked as completed but wasn't done.



  


  


Custom fields:

  * Scheduled for date
  * transit time -- duration of transit time
  * Supplies Used
  * Job Time -- duration of job time
  * first date of issue (not typipcally used)
    * ‘when they received the work order for the first time
    * feels like it came out of some issues with receiving work orders that are a year old, but only seen them for the first time
    * feels like some of the changes, aren't using that as much
    * would be a helpful thing to have



  


They are all using all sections of it

  * But have all the driver's entry into a separate section
  * When you're looking on trello on the phone, it can get cluttered fast



  


What are the attachments

  * The invoice which goes on initiatlly when the work order is created -- when the building was purchased -- snaphost in the notes, but everything that they want to know -- repairman will use it for color of siding, etc -- what electrical should be installed that wasn't -- generated when building was purchased
  * work order that comes through -- 
    * contract information



  


  * warranty claim
  * damage - builder. driver



  


  * if they're lucky they get the actual picture of the repair
  * sometimes if there's been specific email communication regarding it



  


  * repairman needs to attach pictures of completed repair



  


  * need a place to keep track of comments, etc.
  * what's the process for the repairman with the process....



  


  * when they have a second repair, they'll copy it onto a new 
  * when we copy we need to clear out times, etc etc
  * rationale, is that when this is copleted, needs to be completed and invoiced



  


  


  * Will keep things unscheduled until there is a date for them -- some of them will be out of the system, one needs a third visit and waiting on parts/materaisl -- repairs that they mailed them the materials.



  


  


  


  


THEN...they get moved to the completed board, and then Stephanie moves them into Knack

  * To transit time, sometimes their jobs will look like it took 7 hours to get somewhere, but sometimes, they had to leave and had multiple stops on the way -- working on putting a card in when they make a run to Hamptonville to show timing
  * the question/concern, it makes some jobs look expensive but not expensive at all
  * Stephanie has bneen distributing it proportionally across all jobs



  


Transit time is for those two questions...
