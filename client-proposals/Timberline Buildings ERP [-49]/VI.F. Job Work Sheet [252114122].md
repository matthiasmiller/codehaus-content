6.6. Job Work Sheet

  


Requirements

The job worksheet would replace the existing file titled "1-Job Work Sheet", provided by Timberline. It would include additional columns for Hours of Labor Per Phase. This way, the crew can see what is budgeted for each phase and can set goals based on that. The specifics of how the hours budget calculations will be discussed in the in-depth design.
