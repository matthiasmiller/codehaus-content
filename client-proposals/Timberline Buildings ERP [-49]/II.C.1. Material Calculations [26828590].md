2.3.1. Material Calculations

  


Requirements

TOS should calculate materials for each job (concrete, studs, metal, etc.). This would be similar to the "Materials Calc. & Notes" tab on the “5-Material List” spreadsheet shared by Timberline.

  


Note that there are various tabs on the “5-Material List” spreadsheet that were not reviewed in the High-Level Design. These will be reviewed and added to the proposal as needed in the In-Depth Design.

TODO_IDD: Review and cover all tabs in the “5-Material List” spreadsheet - there are a lot of things here that we did not cover in the HLD.
