2.1.6. Contact Types

TOS will use AppHosting’s Contact Types feature. The following is a preliminary list of Types to be used: 

  * Customer
  * Employee (possibly separated in different categories, such as Office Worker, Crew Member, etc.) 
  * Subcontractor
  * Supplier
  * Other



  


  


The subcontractor would have a default hourly rate. This would be configurable and visible on a separate report called Configure Subcontractors.
