2.1.1. Zones

Timberline uses zones to calculate automatic markups for customers in different areas of the state of Pennsylvania. TOS should store these configurations and apply them to orders according to the county and/or township.

  


The zones would have the following fields:

  * Name (text field) 
  * Markup % (number field, to 2 decimal places) 



  


This would increase the box price for buildings in that zone.
