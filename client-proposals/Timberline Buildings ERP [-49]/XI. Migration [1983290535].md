11\. Migration

  


Requirements

During migration, we will import contacts from QuickBooks. This way, repeat orders can continue to be linked to the same person. We will also import a complete customer list from prior orders.

  


To migrate existing files, Timberline will organize the customer folders based on customer name. CodeCrafters will import all of these files onto the appropriate customer record.

  


Development Specification

TODO_CCI - We might need to write a custom Python script to do this.

Or a temporary WSGI.

Not sure how to avoid uploading duplicate files, unless we simply check on name.
