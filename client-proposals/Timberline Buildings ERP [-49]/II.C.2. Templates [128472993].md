2.3.2. Templates

  


Requirements

TOS will have the ability to create new jobs from a template.

  


Development Specification

TODO_CCI: We see a few options:

  * a "Job Templates" customer
  * a "Template" checkbox
  * a "Quote Template" record type



  


The latter is probably the cleanest, since we'll need to check record type anyway for our reporting. TBD
