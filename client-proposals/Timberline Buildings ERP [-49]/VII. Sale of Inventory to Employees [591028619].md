7\. Sale of Inventory to Employees

Employees may purchase inventory from Timberline.

  


TOS can accommodate this through a manual Inventory Adjustment. This will provide a base cost. The cost + markup will be manually billed through QuickBooks. Non-inventory items (i.e. rentals) will be billed through QuickBooks as well.
