5\. Participants and work sites

  


Requirements

While most of the data for participants and work sites will be imported from YEPS, the software will enable CHLDC staff to view, search, and analyze data. Prior years' program data will continue to remain available within the software.

  


USER SPECIFICATION

Participants

  


Participant Search

This report will allow searching for participants by name, email address, phone number, or student ID. It will include columns for participant contact information and participation status (whether they have made a choice.)

  


Additionally, the software will have the ability to store additional student information, such as non-standard qualifications (background check, etc).

  


View All Participants

This report will list all participants. It will have a link to manually create a participant.

  


Import Participant

This interface will allow importing a list of participants from YEPS. The format of this file should be specified during the design phase.

  


  


Work Sites

  


View All Work Sites

This report will list all work sites. It will have a link to manually create a new work site. The software will have the ability to store additional notes about the work site.

  


Sites With No Participants

This may be useful for seeing which work sites are unpopular in order to manage expectations.

  


Full/Overbooked Sites

This will list work sites with that have all their slots filled. It will also list sites that have mistakenly had more slots filled than available.

  


Import Work Sites

Similar to the participant import, this interface will allow importing a list of work sites from YEPS. The format of this file should be specified during the design phase.

  


Development Specification

Each of these should have a program ask prompt. If blank, the report should limit to participants/work sites with active programs.
