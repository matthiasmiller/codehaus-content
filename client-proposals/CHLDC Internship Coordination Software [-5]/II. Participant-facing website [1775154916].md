2\. Participant-facing website

  


Requirements

In the matching process, participants begin by choosing their first, second, and third choices of work sites. The choice of work sites is typically determined by a variety of factors, including location, category/industry, and a description of the work site.

  


USER SPECIFICATION

At the beginning of the program, CHLDC staff will use the software to send an email to all participants. This email will include a customized, private link to web-based interface for choosing work sites.

  


The participant will be able to filter work sites by industry and by job title. Example list:

Name| Address| Description| Distance  
---|---|---|---  
Staples \- Customer service rep  
| 123 N Fulton StBrooklyn, NY 12345| Stacking papers and helping customers, as well as...| 1.2mi (directions)  
Costco \- Shelf stocker| 321 Main StQueens, NY 12346| Stocking shelves; must be 18+.| 3.5mi (directions)  
  
  


Students will be able to sort by work site name as well as distance. In this list, the Distance column refers to direct distance, or distance "as the crow flies."

  


Clicking the work site name will open up a detail page of the work site. This will include the full description provided by the work site, as well as criteria for participants. An example:

  


Staples

  


Job title

Customer service rep

  


Address (map)

123 N Fulton St

Brooklyn, NY 12345

Distance: 3.5mi (directions)

  


Description

Stacking papers and helping customers, as well as providing organizational assistance to management. Spanish language preferred. Hours 7am - 4pm.

  


[Choose this work site]

  


The directions link above will load Google Maps showing directions from the student's address to the address of the work site.

  


Throughout the site, any existing work site choices already made by the participant will be displayed. In case the user needs help, they will have the option to email CHLDC staff.

  


The website will be designed to work on normal computers as well as mobile devices, including recent versions of Android and iOS.

  


Each work site has a limited number of jobs available. Once that many participants have picked that work site, it will disappear from the list of sites, in order to avoid overbooking a site and leaving participants frustrated.

  


Exclusive work sites

Work sites may be designed as exclusive or "by invitation only". In this case, CHLDC staff is responsible to note the work site as such and to enter the list of participants who are invited to that work site. When such a participant views the website, they will initially be shown the work site that specifically invited them, encouraging them to pick that site. They will still be given the option to choose another site if they desire.

  


Bilingual support

Spanish support for the website will be made available for additional cost.

Notes

    * Need an easy way on the Student record to undo a choice approval and allow them to re-choose.

    * Distance between two points: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18883601/function-to-calculate-distance-between-two-coordinates-shows-wrong](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18883601/function-to-calculate-distance-between-two-coordinates-shows-wrong)

How do we display work sites with multiple job titles? I think that we simply display them twice.

Do we display the # of slots for each work site?

  


Exclusive work sites: for those students, the website would recommend that work site.
