7\. Data imports

To avoid tedious and error-prone data entry into the software, imports are needed to import data from YEPS. The data imports will take two forms.

  


Work sites

Work site records are intended to be imported at the start of the program, prior to the first group of participants (see below.) CHLDC is responsible to export the complete group of work sites and job titles from YEPS, then use the software's import facility to import those work sites into the software.

  


Participants

This importing is intended to occur in waves, as groups of participants are decided upon by the NYC Department of Education. Once each group has been decided, CHLDC is again responsible to export that group of participants into the software.

  


USER SPECIFICATION

The software will be configured to import file formats as produced by YEPS. CHLDC agrees to provide sample files necessary for development and troubleshooting of the software.
