Requirements

One-time login link

When accessing the portal from the FBEP link, the email entered will be checked against all family records. If it matches and there is more than one match, there will be a list of families for which the email entered is a primary contact or a primary-type email. A one-time login link will be sent to this email address.

  


Development Specification

There are probably family records with multiple emails in a single line. Account for this.
