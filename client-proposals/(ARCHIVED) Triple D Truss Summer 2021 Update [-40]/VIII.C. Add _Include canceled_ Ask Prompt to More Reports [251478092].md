8.3. Add "Include canceled" Ask Prompt to More Reports

  


Requirements

Currently the "Include canceled" checkbox is only on "Search Quotes & Orders." It would be nice to have it on more reports.

  * Add this to the "View Quote(s)" and "View Order(s)" reports that open from the customer's detail screen.

Add "Include canceled" ask prompt to more reports: Currently the "Include canceled" checkbox is only on "Search Quotes & Orders." Let's add this to the "View Quote(s)" and "View Order(s)" reports that open from the customer's detail screen. 

Tim Reitz 06/15/2021: Ellis said, "Sounds reasonable". 

Tim Reitz 06/18/2021: I'm not sure why I didn't mention this before, but it would be nice to also add it to the "Recent Quotes" and "Recent Orders" reports (accessed from the main menu).

Tim Reitz 06/29/2021: Per Ellis, this looks like one report. Estimate: 2 hours.
