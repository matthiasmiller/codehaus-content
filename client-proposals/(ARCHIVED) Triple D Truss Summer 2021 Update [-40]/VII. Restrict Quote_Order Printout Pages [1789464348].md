7\. Restrict Quote/Order Printout Pages

  


Requirements

If a Quote or Order has only Lumber or only Metal, it prints off an unnecessary sheet (the Truss sheet).  

  


  * If a Quote/Order has only Lumber or only Metal (with no Truss package), print only the corresponding page (and leave out the pages for the packages that aren't in the order). 
  * If the Quote/Order has both Lumber and Metal (with no Truss package), then the Truss page would print out since that's the page that has the combined totals. 
  * If a Quote/Order has a Truss package and Lumber and/or Metal, it would behave as it does now.  
  * Packing lists would behave as they do now.



  


Time Estimate: 1/2 day
