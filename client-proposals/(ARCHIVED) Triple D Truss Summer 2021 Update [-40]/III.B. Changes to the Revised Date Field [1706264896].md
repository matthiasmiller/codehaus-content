3.2. Changes to the Revised Date Field

  


Requirements

The Revised Date actually should be more than simply when the record was last modified - this should track when changes are made to the items/prices for the client. Rather than have the field update each time the record is saved on a different date, let's allow the user to control when it is updated. Also, the Revised Date should be reflected on the printouts if it is different from the Bid Date. 

  * Add a button beside the Revised Date field on the order called "Update"
  * The Revised Date should not update automatically until this button is clicked (and when clicked, the Revised Date should update to today's date)
  * The Revised Date field should still be editable all the time
  * Whenever the Revised Date is updated for a Quote/Order, add the Revised Date to the Quote/Order Sheet and the Packing List printouts beside the Bid Date in the following format: "Bid Date: mm/dd/yyyy; Rev: mm/dd/yyyy" 



  


Time Estimate: 1/2 day
