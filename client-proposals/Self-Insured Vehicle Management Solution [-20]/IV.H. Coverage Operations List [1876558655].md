4.8. Coverage Operations List

*Done.

  


This is a custom non-editable simple list used only in internal macros that are used in coverage amount calculations. Note that this list is not displayed anywhere in the Solution. 

  


It includes the following items: 

  


  * Activate Coverage 
  * Deactivate Coverage 
  * Renew Coverage



  


This list is universal for all users.

  


This list will be set up by CodeCrafters as part of the main development. If changes need to be made to this list, it will require some coding work.
