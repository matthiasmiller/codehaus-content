6.8. Wiki Report

*Done. 

  


Overview: The Solution includes the standard Silverloom Wiki report. This is a two-pane editable report of the Wiki pages in the Solution. By default it only shows active items. Note that any customizations are noted as such in the spec.

Filters: 

  * Search for (plain text field; searches the Wiki page body memos; defaults to blank)

Buttons: 

  * New Page (standard button; opens a blank new Wiki page) 



  


Menu Visibility: Admin-only, by virtue of being on the "Admin" menu (but note that the link is accessible to non-Admin users as well, i.e. if shared directly with them) 

  


Other Notes: 

  * The Read/Unread checkbox saves automatically when edited.
