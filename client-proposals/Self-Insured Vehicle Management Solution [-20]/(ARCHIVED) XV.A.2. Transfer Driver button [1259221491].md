15.0.2. Transfer Driver button

Niccolas Miller 02/13/2023: Moved to Client Details section, marking inactive.

Tim Reitz 09/11/2024: Not seeing them there. Adding them to the "Contact" section. 

  


Beside the prompt, show a button called "Transfer Driver". This would run a automatic process that would:

  * Transfer all high-risk driver fees for this household member from the prior contact to the new contact (including both paid and unpaid fees). Note that if there are any unpaid invoices for a high-risk driver fee, those invoices will remain under the original contact. The agent can manually change the invoice to the new contact if needed.
  * Remove the driver from the prior contact's household drivers.
  * Update all claims for this household member to the new client.

Coded in [[PC0126642]] - ZWA - Transfer High Risk Driver Fees and Claims for New Contact

  


Note:

When creating a new driver contact from an existing driver we need to transfer the following things too

  


[X] Transfer all high-risk driver fees for this household member from the prior contact to the new contact (including both paid and unpaid fees). Note that if there are any unpaid invoices for a high-risk driver fee, those invoices will remain under the original contact. The agent can manually change the invoice to the new contact if needed.

[X] Update all claims for this household member to the new client.

[X] The vehicles that were driven by the household driver will be updated and Primary Driver will be the client himself.

[X] We will confirm the removal of the household driver name from the client contact.
