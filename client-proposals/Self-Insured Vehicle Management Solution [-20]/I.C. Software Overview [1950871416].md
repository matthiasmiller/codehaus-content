Requirements

*Done. 

  


This Silverloom Solution provides a software system for managing the operations of the Weaverland Mennonite Vehicle Aid Plans in multiple states. It was initially designed and built for the Pennsylvania Plan, and has been expanded to allow it to be used in multiple distinct iterations by other Plans as well.

  


The official name for this software is the "Self-Insured Vehicle Management Solution", or "SIVM Solution" for short. The "Base" software includes many settings that can be configured individually for each Plan's version / iteration.

  


The SIVM Solution provides capabilities to manage the following:

  * Clients
  * Vehicles & coverages
  * Invoicing
  * Annual renewals
  * Claims
  * Postcards
  * Internal notifications for users



  


There is also the opportunity to add integration with Silverloom's Accounting Module in the future.
