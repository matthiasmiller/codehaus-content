4.11. Client Statuses List

*Done.

  


This is a custom user-editable simple list used to track Client Statuses.

  


The following items are hard-coded: 

  


  * Active

This list is universal for all users.

  


All users can add additional items via the list interface (but note that items added this way will not have customized behaviors).
