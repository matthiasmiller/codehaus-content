1.1. Weaverland Auto Plans Overview

*Done. 

  


The Weaverland Conference of the Mennonite Church has a self-insurance program for vehicles that allows its members to participate in an auto insurance sharing program, rather than in a standard auto insurance plan.

  


Each member "client" is assessed different fees for different types or levels of coverage. Each client is represented by an agent who is responsible for interacting with the clients, providing membership cards, managing coverages, invoicing, and payments, and helping to process claims, etc.

  


There are multiple Groups (also referred to as "Plans") in various states. These Plans operate separately but in close connection with each other. There are some differences from Plan to Plan in how they operate, but the general approach is the same.
