4.5. Credit Options List

  


Requirements

*Done. 

  


This is a custom non-editable simple list used to track options for handling credits/refunds. It includes the following items: 

  


  * Invoice 
  * Credit (only visible on historical items that pre-date the removal of the credit feature) 
  * Dismiss



  


This list is universal for all users.

  


Note that this sequence is static, so it should always be displayed in this sequence throughout the Solution.

  


This list is set up by CCI as part of the main development. If changes need to be made to this list, it will require some coding work.
