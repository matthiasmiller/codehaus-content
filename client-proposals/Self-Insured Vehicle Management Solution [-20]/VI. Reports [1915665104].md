Client Search (1 day)

 \- Types are actually just the Contact Types

  


Aging Report (1 day)

 \- probably need to add the filter to our existing aging report. Also group by Agent. Let's discuss. We could also just override with a separate simple Aging report for them.

  


Insurance Card (1 day)

 \- This just displays a PDF with 3 backs. They can print as many as they like.
