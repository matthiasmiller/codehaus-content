4.9. Coverage History Statuses List

*Done.

  


This is a custom user-editable simple list used to track the status of Coverage History items. It includes the following read-only items: 

  


  * Active
  * Canceled
  * Used



  


This list is universal for all users, and users with access to the "Lists" settings can add to it via that interface. 

  


The read-only items for this list are set up by CodeCrafters, and coding is needed to make any changes to them. Any items that are added manually within the Solution do not have any real effect at this point, as they are not manually selected anywhere in the Solution.
