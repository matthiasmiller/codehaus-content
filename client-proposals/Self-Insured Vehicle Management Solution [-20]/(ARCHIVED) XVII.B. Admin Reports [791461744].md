Development Specification

Ellis Miller 08/18/2020:

 

Permissions -

We will likely code this as we are doing various screens, adding 1 day for bid.

 

CanEditRecord: Contacts, Vehicles, Claims.

 

Use restricted data for Payment Status/Date. Make sure that you can't edit a record where data is restricted.

 

All Admin reports should be called Std Admin. They should be visible on menu for Admin. Subsets should include UserIsAdmin so that the report is empty for-non-admins.
