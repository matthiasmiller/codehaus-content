Development Specification

TODO_: Tim Reitz 08/12/2025: For now I'm only noting a very basic spec for this, for sake of time. At some point it would be great to have this fully specced. Note that this is the "Std Renew All Vehicles Import.x30" import ([https://testweaverland.silverloom.io/ImportSettings/Standard/Std_Renew_All_Vehicles_Import?State=pa4IpoPlMj0&](https://testweaverland.silverloom.io/ImportSettings/Standard/Std_Renew_All_Vehicles_Import?State=pa4IpoPlMj0&) in the test system).
