Requirements

TODO_: Tim Reitz 07/19/2025: Mark finished sections with "*Done" throughout the Proposal.

  


This is the "living design spec" for the based Self-Insured Vehicle Management Silverloom (SIVM) Solution, initially designed for and provided to the Weaverland Mennonite Vehicle Aid Plan of Pennsylvania, and later expanded for use by other self-insured Groups. 

  


This based Solution can be duplicated and configured for other Groups who might wish to use the SIVM Solution. Each Group uses their own copy of the SIVM Solution with their own configurations, with the base system remaining the same, and changes applied to the base system would be applied to all copies.
