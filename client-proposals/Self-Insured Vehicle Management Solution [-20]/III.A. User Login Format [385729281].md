3.1. User Login Format

*Done. 

  


The Solution uses the username/password login format. 

  


The login credentials are set on the User Profile. These are standard features. 

  


Password requirements (standard): 

  * Minimum of 8 characters 
  * At least 1 capital letter and 1 number ("Alpha, Numeric"). 



  


Other Notes: 

  * Note that an email address is required by the database for all User Logins, even if the user is not using the Quick Login format. If a user does not have an email address, one workaround is to enter a Gmail or Gmail-hosted email address and simply add "+" and the user's name before the "@" symbol. CodeCrafters can provide more information on this process.
