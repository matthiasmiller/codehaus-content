4.1. Address Types List

*Done.

  


This is a standard user-editable simple list used to track Address Types for Contacts.

  


The following items are hard-coded: 

  


  * Primary

  * Shipping 



  


This list is universal for all users.

  


All users can add additional items via the list interface (but note that items added this way will not have customized behaviors).
