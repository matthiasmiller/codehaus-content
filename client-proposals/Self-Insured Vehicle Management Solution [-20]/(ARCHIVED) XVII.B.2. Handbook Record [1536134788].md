Development Specification

Matthias Miller 07/13/2020: If it's easy to have the PDF open directly, let's do that. If not, just let them click through.

  


Ellis Miller 08/18/2020: 1 day. May be easiest to simply have a Handbook lookup record with permission to edit by Administrators. I think we may be able to use an Auto-push report to launch the PDF from the menu. We'd need to explore what eval functions we have for Archived Documents. We'd need a separate "Configure Handbook" menu page.
