4.12. Filter Dates List

*Done. 

  


This is a custom user-editable simple list used to track Filter Date ranges.

  


The following items are hard-coded: 

  * Period Year
  * Date Range
  * Calendar Year



  


This list is universal for all users.

  


All users can add additional items via the list interface (but note that items added this way will not have customized behaviors). Any additions to this list would also require changes to report settings in order to function.
