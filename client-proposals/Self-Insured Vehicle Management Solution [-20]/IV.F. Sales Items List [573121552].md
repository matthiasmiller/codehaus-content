4.6. Sales Items List

*Done. 

  


This is a custom non-editable simple list used to track Sales Items (used instead of the standard Silverloom Stales Items configuration records). It includes the following items: 

  


  * Liability Premium
  * VLS Entry Fee
  * VLS Premium
  * Cargo Entry Fee
  * Cargo Premium
  * High-Risk Driver Fee
  * Credit
  * Other



  


This list is universal for all users.

  


Note that this sequence is static, so it should always be displayed in this sequence throughout the Solution.

  


This list is set up by CCI as part of the main development. If changes need to be made to this list, it will require some coding work.
