3.3. Permissions

The Solution includes various custom permissions that control visibility and/or editability of various portions of the solution, including reports, records, and parts of records. These permissions normally are enabled on a per-User Group basis, allowing all Users in a Group to access the corresponding information.

  


The table below lists the relevant permissions in the Solution and the User Groups that have the corresponding permissions enabled:

  * By default, users in the Administrator User Group have all Permissions, and therefore have full view & edit access to the whole Solution.
