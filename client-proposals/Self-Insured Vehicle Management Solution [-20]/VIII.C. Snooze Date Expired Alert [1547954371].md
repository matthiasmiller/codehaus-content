8.3. Snooze Date Expired Alert

TODO_VA: report alert? 

  


TODO_CCI: can you share details on this?

Sagar Sagar 12/11/2025: I am trying to write about it briefly.

  


A System Notification is displayed for any snoozed clients for the current agent and the admins that were snoozed until date set, but the date is before today, and not being activated again.

  


The notification will run the Snooze Date Expired report when it is clicked. Admins can see all of the snoozed clients whereas agents will only see their clients.
