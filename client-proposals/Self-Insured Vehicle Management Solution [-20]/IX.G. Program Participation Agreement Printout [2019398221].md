It also includes signature and date fields for the client, primary driver, and agent to sign, and may include a copy of the Vehicle Guidelines for the Plan.

  * In the printout body:



I, <Client or Primary Contact FirstName LastName>, understand that my <Year> <Make> <Model> with VIN/Serial Number <VIN / Serial #> has been entered into the <contents of the "Plan name" System Switch, in bold font> for the purpose of obtaining the following coverage(s): 

"< Self-Insured Liability Coverage - State Minimum Coverage>" (visible if the Vehicle has active Liability Coverage)

  


"<<Alternate text for Collision - Long label> Coverage - Initial Enrolled Coverage Amount: $<Coverage Amount>" (visible if the Vehicle has active Collision Coverage)

  


"<Cargo Coverage - Initial Enrolled Coverage Amount: $<Coverage Amount>" (visible if the Vehicle has active Cargo Coverage)

  


The Primary Driver of the vehicle is <Primary Drive FirstName LastName>.

I understand that this is a legal agreement between the “Plan”, known as <contents of the "Program Participation Agreement Plan Name" System Switch> and the state of <contents of the "Plan state name" System Switch>.

I understand that <Alternate text for Collision - Short label> (<Alternate text for Collision - Long label>) is strictly a mutual sharing plan among Weaverland Conference members to assist with accident related repair costs or total loss of the member’s enrolled vehicle. <Alternate text for Collision - Short label> does not assist with towing, recovery or storage costs. 

I understand that any costs incurred by accidents requiring payment will increase the costs for all the participants of this plan.

I will try to the best of my ability to be a safe and courteous driver.

I have received a copy of the <contents of the "Plan name" System Switch, in bold font> Vehicle Guidelines and agree to keep my vehicle within these Guidelines.

I understand these Guidelines are for all Weaverland Conference members, whether or not they participate in the Plan.
