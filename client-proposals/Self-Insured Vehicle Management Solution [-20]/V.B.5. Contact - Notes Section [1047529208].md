5.2.5. Contact - Notes Section

TODO_VA: Tim Reitz 11/20/2025: This is conditionally visible, I think based on the following: 

\- hidden if the selected Contact Type is a client-type

\- visible if the selected Contact Type is not a client-type

I realized that this is conditionally visible while working on [[[IN12329](https://zch.apphosting.zone/Detail/Edit/2?RecordType=Incidents&NumberID=-12331&)]] - ZWA - Contact - Fix Visibility for Client Details Section. 

TODO_CCI: Tim Reitz 11/20/2025: Do I have the correct visibility conditions noted above? 

Sagar Sagar 12/10/2025: Yes, you are correct.
