11.5. Index Report

The Index Report would provide a report of all Index Names and Index Page #'s for the selected Publication Date. It should default to the current Publication Date, and the title should be "Index for <Publication Date>". 

  


This report also is the base for the Index export. The Index can be exported either from the Advanced option at the top of this report or from the Export Index menu option (see corresponding section of this proposal).

  


Columns: 

  * Customer (Index Name) - (link to Customer/Ads Page; this should be from the Index Name field on the Ad Details)
  * Index Page #
  * Publication (Full Admin only)



  


Filters:

  * Publication Date (default to current; NOT blank = all)
  * Publication (only for Full Admins; list of publications; default to blank = all)



  


Grouping/Sorting:

  * No grouping
  * Sort by Customer (Index Name), then by Index Page #
