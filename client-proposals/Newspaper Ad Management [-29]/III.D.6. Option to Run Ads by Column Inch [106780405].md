3.4.6. Option to Run Ads by Column Inch

  


Requirements

At this point the Column Inch option will not be fully designed or developed, but this section functions as a plan for it as a possible future enhancement. What is presented here is a concept of what this feature could look like, not a definitive design. Also, the development of this feature is not included in the proposal price, though any underlying features needed to make this possible in the future may be included. 

  


A publication would use either the Ad Sizes or the Column Inch option, but not both. This would be determined in the Configure Publication detail for the publication. 

  


If/when this is fully designed and developed, it would probably configured via a variation of the Ad Size Details Sales Item. 

  


The Column Inch options would probably have fewer Ad Sizes (probably based on the number of columns - 1, 2, 3, or 4), with the option to have variable Ad Heights. If Variable Ad Height is selected, the Ad Heights would then be editable on the Ad Detail, in set increments, such as .5 inches. The prices would become unit (column inch) prices. The square inches would be calculated on the ad record instead of the ad configuration. 

  


Special Placements might be limited to one special placement per page (removing the "Location" options). However, further design could be done to determine how to incorporate more complexity on this, perhaps selling ads in certain increments (probably half-inch increments) that match a "Column Inch Layout Grid". 

  


There might be an option to charge more for certain types of ads, such as health or medical-related ads. This could be selected on the Ad Detail with a drop-down, like Color/B&W. This feature would only be for Column Inch ads.

  


As mentioned, further design and price calculations for this feature will need to be done if or when this feature is desired.
