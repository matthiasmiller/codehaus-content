3.6. Deactivating Publications

If a publication closes down and the owner wants to continue using the database for other publications or other things, the Full Admin User will remove all Standard Users and Publication Admin Users associated with the publication, at which point it can be considered to be deactivated. 

  


Notifications and emails will continue to go out if they have not be stopped. The Full Admin can go in after deactivation and stop them if needed.
