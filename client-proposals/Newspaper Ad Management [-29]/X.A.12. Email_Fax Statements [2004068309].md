10.1.12. Email/Fax Statements

  


Requirements

This feature allows for faxing or emailing statements to customers who have selected email or fax as their invoice preference. These can be sent on an individual basis or to all such customers at once. Note that these options are for sending only the statements - this would not include the ad images. 

  


There will be the following Menu option for batch-sending statements: 

  * Email/Fax Statements



  


And there will be the following link on the Customer/Ads Page, as mentioned in that section: 

  * Email/Fax Statement



  


Clicking on either of these would open a page prompting for the following:

  * Customer (list of Customers with Invoice Preference set to Email or Fax; default to blank = all if opening from the Menu; default to the corresponding Customer if opening from a Customer/Ads Page)
  * Statement Date (required; default to "today")
  * Publication (only for Full Admins; list of publications; default to blank = all)



  


Clicking Continue on the prompt page would prepare statements for any unpaid and/or overdue invoices as of the selected date for the selected customer(s), prepare the emails with the statements, and pull up an email template with all the emails/faxes that are going out. This will show two panes: on the left it will show a list of emails going out and the right will show a read-only preview of the selected item on the left.

  


Development Specification

The Invoices and Statements prompts should be the same, except one is for Invoices and the other for Statements. Note that there is only one mockup page for these, labeled for Invoices.
