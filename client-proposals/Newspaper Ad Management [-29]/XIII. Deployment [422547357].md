13\. Deployment

  


Requirements

As part of the initial package, CodeCrafters/CodeHaus will provide a special level of support for the deployment of the software solution. This would begin before deployment and would be in effect for 6 weeks after the initial deployment date. 

  


This would include:

  * Intentional planning and communication 
  * Importing of data (as noted in the Importing Data section of this proposal)
  * Training for users (approximately 8-10 hours; via Zoom calls and/or recorded videos)
  * A basic user's guide in the Wiki section of the software, available long-term (and PDF copies if desired)
  * Weekly check-ins to provide opportunity to discuss questions, problems, and ideas
  * Premium-level support access (already included in the Premium Subscription type; see the Proposal Cost section of this proposal for more details)
  * An update to the software within a few weeks after the initial deployment to fix important issues or make important changes (as needed)



  


CodeCrafters/CodeHaus would also provide an update to the software 3-5 months after the initial deployment to fix less urgent issues and to make additional changes to the software (as needed/desired; see the Changes and Enhancements notes in the Proposal Cost section of this proposal for more details)

  


The purpose of this is to help with a smooth transition and strong foundation for the long-term success of this software. 

  


CodeCrafters/CodeHaus can also provide access to the test system for John and other PNP team members prior to the deployment of the live software. The purpose of this is to allow users to become familiar with the software in a sample environment (softening the learning curve) and to help ensure that the software matches your workflow and expectations (reducing surprises and follow-up changes).

  


Development Specification

Tim Reitz 02/22/2021: I'm including this to help communicate the value we're providing beyond the software itself.

  


Notes for deployment/setup: John would like to know the ins and outs of setting up the publications, so let's do it with him/walk him through it and work together on it.
