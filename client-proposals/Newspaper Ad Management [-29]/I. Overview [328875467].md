1\. Overview

  


Requirements

Plain Network Publishing is looking to replace their current ads management software. They purchased a license for their current software from PCBE, but they are looking to replace the entire system. One of the goals is to make this database so simple that anyone can use it. 

  


Here is a brief overview of their workflow process from PNP's perspective: 

1\. A customer calls in and we set up an account or open their account, discuss the ad the ad they want. Over the course of a few calls we come to an agreement on the size and other details, and schedule the ad. We leave notes with the ad record (tasks). 

2\. The customer works with their graphic designer or ours to design the ad (the graphic designer does not need access to database), and they submit it to us when it is ready. 

3\. We check the tasks list, where we can see all tasks that are open under each user's name for a specific publication date.

4\. Before going to publication for the current date, we review all current ads to make sure they are all in and nothing stands out, and we export the ad image files to a folder on the desktop (which gets created in the process).

5\. We export files for the index and the special placement requests. 

6\. Billing: Currently we do this manually and outside the software (but this proposal includes plans to build in invoicing, payments, and sales reporting). 

7\. We print off copies of the invoices and send an invoice to each customer along with a cutout copy of each of their printed ads. 

  


Here is a brief overview of the main points of what this proposal includes:

  * Database for managing ads for publications:
    * Customers
    * Ads records, scheduling, and storage
    * Downloading of ad files via a zipped folder
    * Note-keeping/tasks that can be linked to ad records and can be assigned to users
    * Reminders that are linked to tasks
  * Streamlined billing
    * Invoicing
    * Statements
    * Payments (including card payments and stored cards)
    * Prepay/credit feature
  * Sales reporting



  


While this proposal represents the full design package to date, there is the option to develop in stages if needed or desired. Certain sections of the proposal are marked with this option and will be priced separately.

  


Currently there is only one publication with ads being managed in this solution, but we are building this to be able manage ads for multiple publications while keeping them completely separate.

  


John would like the ability to resell this solution to other individuals or publication companies, so certain things are being put in place to be able to do that.

  


Development Specification

Tim Reitz 10/20/2020:

  * Ballpark time frame: 3-4 weeks for initial design; 1-3 weeks for mockups & review; 1-2 weeks for pricing
    * Can get more firm from Ellis -- maybe 2-4 mo build-out --
    * His thoughts from the project -- we talked about doing different phases, for the entire project, then break it out into multiple parts and do just the ad scheduling, and maybe doing the final functions later. It will probably depend on what the price is going to be and what he can allot for the project.
    * Target -- an April-June rollout.



Tim Reitz 03/23/2021: This took much longer in the design phase than we anticipated. He would still like deployment of at least some of the project by June/July. 

  


Tim Reitz 01/05/2021: Matthias - what is a ballpark price range?

Tim Reitz 01/08/2021: Upper end of $20-40K.

Tim Reitz 03/22/2021: We're now seeing that it will probably be significantly above this. Probably at least $60-70K. 

  


Tim Reitz 02/04/2021: Ideas for reducing initial cost

  * Breaking into stages
  * Separating customers, ads, and tasks into separate records
  * Using separate subdomains instead of so much restricted data?



  


  


Tim Reitz 02/04/2021: John is thinking that by June he's really going to be needing the software. He was wondering about breaking development into stages. He sees three main stages: 

1\. Customer/Ads page

2\. Billing/Invoicing

3\. Tasks

I'm thinking that Billing/Invoicing would be included with Stage 1 since we already have those modules developed and just have customizations to do for him. 

  


Reminders and handling prepaying are two sections that we had discussed before as being parts that we'd design now, but maybe develop in the future. He said today that he would see the prepay part as being important to include with the billing/invoicing part.

  


Tim Reitz 10/21/2020: John had expressed something about how we have access to data. Keep an ear out for more of this.
