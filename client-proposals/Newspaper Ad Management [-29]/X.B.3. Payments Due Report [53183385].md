10.2.3. Payments Due Report

The Payments Due Report would show all unpaid invoices (all invoices with the "Invoiced" status), including invoices with partial payments applied to them.

  


It would have the following:

Columns:

  * Customer (link to Customer/Ads Page)
  * Invoice Number (link to the Invoice Detail)
  * Invoice Date 
  * Due Date
  * Original Balance Due
  * Late Fees (total of all assessed late fees for that invoice
  * Total Balance Due
  * Publication (only for Full Admin)



  


Prompts: 

  * Customer (default to blank = all)
  * Publication (only for Full Admins; list of publications; default to blank = all)



  


Grouping/Sorting: 

  * No grouping 
  * Sort by Customer, then by Invoice #



  


If the user wants to adjust the balance due or remove/reduce late fees for any invoice, they can open that invoice detail and make those edits there, then either return to this report or receive payment from the invoice detail itself. 

  


There would be a "Receive Payment" button at the top of the report. Selecting a row from the report and clicking on this button would open the Manage Payments page pre-filled with the selected customer and invoice. Clicking on this button with no selected row would open a blank Manage Payments page.
