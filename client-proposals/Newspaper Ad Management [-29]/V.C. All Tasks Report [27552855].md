5.3. All Tasks Report

The All Tasks report is an multipane editable report that shows all tasks, both assigned and Unassigned, for a selected publication date. All users should be able to see and edit each others' tasks.

  


Clicking on the menu option will open the report, defaulting to the current publication date. 

  


The left pane should be a report with the following columns:

  * Assignee (editable; list of assignees and Unassigned)
  * Task Name 
  * Customer (link to the Customer/Ads Page)
  * Ad Title
  * Publication Date (editable; list of current and future publication dates)
  * New Comment (editable; multi-line plain text; grows to two lines tall, after which it will scroll; open the Customer/Ads Page to add images or formatted text)
  * Complete? (checkbox; editable)
  * Save Changes button



Any changes in this pane must be saved before editing the comments. 

  


This pane should have the following filters: 

  * Assignee (multi-select; default to blank = all; always show Unassigned even if one or more specific Assignees are selected)
  * Publication Date (default to current publication date; blank = all)
  * Show Completed Tasks (checkbox; default to checked)



  


Grouping/Sorting:

  * Group by Task Assignee
    * Unassigned grouped at the top, then other grouped listed by Assignee name
  * Within each group, sort by Status (Incomplete, Complete), then alphabetically by Customer 



  


The right pane should have the following report: 

  * Prior Comments (read-only; for the selected row)



  


General Notes: 

Completed tasks should be shown in gray, as they are on the embedded spreadsheets on the Customer/Ads Pages. 

  


There will be a "New Task" button at the top of the report page. See the corresponding section of this proposal for more details.
