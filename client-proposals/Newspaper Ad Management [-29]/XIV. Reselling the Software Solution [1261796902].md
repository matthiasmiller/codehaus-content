14\. Reselling the Software Solution

If or when PNP wishes to resell copies of this Ads Management Software to other clients, the specific terms of the sale shall be negotiated at that time. The email sent from CodeCrafters/CodeHaus on November 30, 2020, titled "MOU about Reselling the Ads Management Software" serves as a Memorandum of Understanding of the intent of CCI/CH to provide PNP an opportunity to market this software solution. A negotiation of terms can be initiated by either party, and a formal contract can be developed in the future if desired.
