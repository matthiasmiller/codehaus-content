4.3.1. Ads List Child Screen

The Ads List Child Screen will be opened by clicking a button on the Ad Details section. This will open a popup/child screen of all Ad Titles for the current Customer. Note that this will not show all runnings of these ads, but rather a summary of each Ad Detail, based on the current or most recent running of the ad. 

  


The child screen will have an embedded spreadsheet with a column for all of the fields on the Ad Details section: 

  * Ad Title*
  * Ad Size*
  * Ad Color*
  * Ad Price*
  * Run Until Further Notice
  * Index Name
  * Special Placement Page Location
  * Special Placement Page Number
  * Charge for Special Placement 
  * Pay with Credit
  * Create Invoice
  * Publication Schedule 
  * Past Schedule  
  * Upload/Preview
  * Ad File Name
  * Actual Ad Dimensions
  * Download Ad
  * Print Ad
  * Email Proof
  * Fax Proof



It would also have these two additional columns

  * Next Publication Date* (from Publication Schedule; blank if the ad is not scheduled for a current or future Publication Date)
  * Most Recent Publication Date* (from Past Schedule; blank if the ad has not been run in the past)



  


The items that are marked with an asterisk above should be visible on this embedded spreadsheet; the rest will either be hidden or placed on the far right-hand side where the user would scroll over to see them. 

  


The list should be sorted by Next Publication Date, then by Most Recent Publication Date, so that the future ads are at the top, the current ads are in the middle, and the past/inactive ads are at the bottom. 

  


To jump straight to a specific ad from this list, click on the desired ad, then close the child screen, and the ad will be open on the Customer/Ads Page.

  


A new ad can be created from this child screen by clicking the "+" button beside the embedded spreadsheet.
