5.4. Creating New Tasks

New Tasks can be manually created in a few different ways.

  


1\. By using the "+" button beside the embedded spreadsheet. This would pre-fill the Customer field based on the current Customer/Ads Page, but would not pre-fill any other fields.

Note that since tasks will not be deleted, there will not be a "-" button like there often is beside embedded spreadsheets. 

  


2\. By using the "Create Task" button on an Ad Detail. This would pre-fill the following fields on the new Task:

  * Customer (based on the current Customer/Ads Page) 
  * Ad Title (based on the Ad Detail from which it was created) 
  * Publication Date (default to current) 



  


3\. By using the "Create Task" button on the Tasks Report. Clicking this button would open a prompt page with the following fields: 

  * Customer (required; drop list of all Customers)
  * Task Name (same as on the Task Detail)
  * Publication Date (same as on the Task Detail)
  * Assignee (same as on the Task Detail)
  * Comment (multi-line plain text field; push into Comments memo as the initial comment, including signature stamp)



Clicking Continue on this prompt page would create a new Task pre-filled based on what was filled from the prompt page. It also would open the Customer/Ads Page so the Task could be viewed immediately
