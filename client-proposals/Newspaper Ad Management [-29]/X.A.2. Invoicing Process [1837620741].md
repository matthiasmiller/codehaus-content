10.1.2. Invoicing Process

Batch Invoicing:

After a publication goes out, batch invoicing should be able to happen for all ads for that publication date. This would be done by opening the "Ads Ready for Invoicing" report and clicking the "Invoice All Ads" button (see details in that section of this proposal).

  


This should create one invoice per customer, combining all uninvoiced ads for that customer. Technically this is for the current and all past publication dates, but there should not be any uninvoiced ads from previous publication dates because the system requires all ads to be invoiced before the publication date can be advanced.  

  


There will also be an option on this report to do batch invoicing on a per-customer basis (all uninvoiced ads for a selected customer). 

  


Either way, these invoices can then be viewed from the Invoices report or from the individual Customer/Ads Pages. 

  


Invoicing Individual Ads:

There will also be the option to manually invoice an individual ad. This can be done by clicking the "Create Invoice" link on the Ad Detail. This creates an invoice for the current publication date. This invoice can then be viewed from the Invoices report or the Customer/Ads Page for that customer.

  


Auto-pay Customers and Prepaid Ads: Ads for customers with auto-pay set up and ads that are marked "Pay with Credit" will be paid automatically after invoicing. However, for the auto-pay ads there will be a authorization step, as described in the "Ads Ready for Invoicing Report" and "Automatic Payments" sections of this proposal.
