4.2. Linked Contacts Section

The Customer/Ads Page will store a list of "linked contacts" for people like the customer's graphics designer or accountant.These will be displayed using an embedded spreadsheet. Linked contacts will not be shared with other customers, so if multiple customers use the same graphics designer, that contact will need to be entered manually for each customer. 

  


Note that these are not separate contact records, but simply information that is stored on the Customer/Ads Pages. 

  


This spreadsheet should show at least 4 rows without scrolling and it should have the ability to move rows up and down on the list. There should also be buttons to add or remove contacts from the the list. 

  


It should track
