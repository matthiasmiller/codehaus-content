11.4. Square Inch Report

The Square Inch Report shows the number of square inches for the ads in a selected publication date. The square inch numbers values are determined by the selected Ad Sizes in the Ad Details for the selected publication date, multiplied by the measurements set in Ad Size Sales Items. 

  


For the selected publication date (or blank = all), this report should show:

  * Number of Color ads
  * Number of B&W ads
  * Grand total number of ads
  * Number of Color ads for each ad size
  * Number of B&W ads for each ad size
  * Square inches of Color ads for each ad size
  * Square inches of B&W ads for each ad size
  * Grand total square inches of all ads



  


The report should open after a prompt for Publication Date (blank = all), defaulting the the current Publication Date, and it should have the following: 

  


Columns:

  * Ad Size
  * # Color Ads
  * # B&W Ads
  * Total # Ads
