11.6. Special Placement Report

The Special Placement Report would show placement information for each ad with a special placement request in the selected Publication Date. It should default to the current Publication Date, and the title should be "Special Placements for <Publication Date>".

  


This report also is the base for the Special Placement export. This can be exported either from the Advanced option at the top of this report or from the Export Special Placement menu option (see corresponding section of this proposal).
