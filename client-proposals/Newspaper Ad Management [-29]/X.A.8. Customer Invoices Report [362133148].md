10.1.8. Customer Invoices Report

This is AppHosting's standard "Invoices for Contact" report. It shows invoices on a per-customer basis. It can be accessed in two ways:

  * By opening a Customer/Ads Page and clicking the "View Invoices" link in the Invoices section (this will probably be the main way it is opened)
  * By clicking the Customer Invoices menu option and selecting the customer's name from the prompt



  


Either way, this report shows invoices for one customer at a time. 

  


As mentioned above, opening this report from the menu would first open a prompt page on which the user would select the customer's name. 

  


This report would have the following: 

Columns: 

  * Invoice # (link to invoice page)
  * Date
  * Status
  * Total Amount



  


Filter: 

  * Contact
  * Publication (only for Full Admins; list of publications; default to blank = all)



  


Grouping/Sorting:

  * No grouping
  * Sorted by Date (most recent at the top)



  


It will have a grand total row at the bottom of the Total Amount column. 

  


It will have a "New Invoice" button at the top.
