10.4. Discounts

Discounts set up in the Sales Items can be selected manually on a per-customer basis. Once one of these discounts has been selected for a customer, it will apply to all runnings of all ads for that customer until it is manually removed or replaced.

  


These customer discounts can be combined with the Prepay Discount (as noted in the Prepay Discount section of this proposal). The Prepay Discount comes off after the customer discount has been taken off the total), but they do not apply to Special Placement Charges.

  


PNP currently offers Multiple Run Discounts  and Special Discounts: 

  * Multiple Run Discount \- discounts that are given if a customer runs the same ad x number of times; cannot be combined with Special Discounts
    * Example: 3 times = 5%; 6 times = 10%; 9 times = 15%
    * If they are running one ad 3 times and another ad 6 times, the 10% discount is applied to all their and shows on the customer page, rather than the 5% discount for the 3 times. 
  * Special Discount \- periodic discounts that are run to attract new customers, etc.
    * Example: Winter discount, new customer discount, etc.
