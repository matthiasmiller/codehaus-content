3.4.4. Prepay Discounts Category

  


Requirements

The Prepay Discount category should have the same fields as Customer Discount. 

  


The system would only allow one Prepay Discount to be set up at a time. 

  


The Prepay Discount would apply only to ads that are marked Pay with Credit

  


Development Specification

Price Fields: Tim Reitz 02/17/2021: Our proposal is to use a custom field on the Sales Item for the the Discount % and not allow a standard price. If invoicing manually, price will be blank (enter manually). 

Tim Reitz 02/17/2021: We should probably think through this more. Maybe add a Discount Column to the Invoice (either the Code or %)?
