3.2. User Groups

The Solution will use various User Groups to determine permissions for different users. Each user should be assigned to a User Group. Note that the User Group (used for User Profiles / user logins) is distinct from the Contact Type (used for Contact records).

  


User Groups are manually configured in the Solution. This can be done with assistance from CCI as needed.

  


The following are the User Groups used in the Solution. Note that the data access details included here are generalizations (see the Permissions section of this proposal for the full details). 

  


  * TBD



  


Other Notes: 

  * Additional User Groups, such as "Member Users" could be added at some point in the future.
