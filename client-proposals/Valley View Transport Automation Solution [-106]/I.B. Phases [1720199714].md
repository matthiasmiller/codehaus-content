1.2. Phases

  


Requirements

The design and development can be broken out into various phases to reduce initial cost and allow for quicker turnaround time in deploying the Solution to meet higher-priority needs.

  


The projected phases are:

  * Simplify back office (including Customer Portal)
  * Barcode / QR code feature 
  * Long-term ideas:
    * Ability to track/create duplicate codes when blanket wrapping



  


Note that this proposal is for Phases 1 and 2.
