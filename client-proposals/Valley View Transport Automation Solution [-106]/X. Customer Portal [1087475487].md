10\. Customer Portal

  


Requirements

The Solution will provide some form of a customer portal, to allow customers to log in and see the status of any current order that has been placed.

  


This portal can be done in the form of a restricted account, unless it's more reasonable to do it as a WSGI. 

  


The portal will contain the following items:

  * Report of open orders
  * Only allow viewing orders
  * Add data restriction rules for orders



  


Development Specification

  * Login via email link
  * Table with recent orders + status + link to download BOL (if VVT wants to give access) and Order PDFs
