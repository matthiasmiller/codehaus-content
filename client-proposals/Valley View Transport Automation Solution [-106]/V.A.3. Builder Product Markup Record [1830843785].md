5.1.3. Builder Product Markup Record

  


Requirements

Overview: This is a custom record type, used to track Builder Product Markups. This record defines product-specific pricing adjustments applied on top of base rates, such as the +4% markup for outdoor assembled furniture or special rates for unfinished pine & alder pieces. These markups vary by product type and can be combined with regional adjustments to calculate final shipping charges.
