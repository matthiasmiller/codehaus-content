18\. Pricing Estimate

  


Requirements

CodeCrafters has reviewed the high-level design that we put together for your software solution. Keep in mind that the final quoted price would come after the completion of an In-Depth Design, and could be higher or lower than this, or somewhere around what we're thinking now, depending on how all the details work out. Based on the information we gathered in the high-level design, we are anticipating this to be in the $35,000 - 55,000 range for the design, development, and deployment of this solution. 

  


Also, as with building a house or buying a vehicle, there are ongoing maintenance expenses to make sure the software keeps working well for the long haul. When we build a software solution, we provide ongoing support and maintenance that includes the following: 

  * System hosting
  * Regular backups
  * Monitoring
  * Unlimited U.S.-based phone support
  * Up-to-date system documentation
  * Security updates and bug fixes
  * Enhancements to the Silverloom platform
  * Design for minor system change requests



Industry standards show that software maintenance typically has an annual cost of about 10-25% of the original investment. We would expect your annual maintenance expenses to be in the 10-15% range (probably $5,250 - 8,250 per year based on our current ballpark estimate).

  


In addition to the above estimated annual cost, there would be a monthly cost for a monthly hosting & subscription fee. This fee covers the cost of hosting and the Silverloom Business Suite software subscription. There are three main parts to this fee:

  * The base fee ($175/month)
  * The per-user fees (first 5 users are included in the base fee, users 6-15 are an additional $15/month/user, users 16-25 are an additional $10/month/user, any user after 25 is $5/month/user)
  * The additional storage fee ($10/month per GB that exceeds the 2GB that are included for free)



This monthly invoice is sent on the 10th of every month, post-billing for the previous month. This invoice would also include any billable changes that were applied in the previous month, so while the minimum amount on any monthly invoice would be $175, the invoice could be higher than this depending on the number of users and any applied billable changes.

  


If any of this looks higher than what your budget would allow, we could potentially reduce cost and scope in one or more ways, such as starting out with only a few features and adding others as time goes on, or simplifying various parts of the solution. We're committed to giving you high value with whatever you move forward with, and we'd be glad to discuss this with you on a call if you have any questions. 

  


If you decide to move forward with the In-Depth Design and then to move forward with development of the full project, we plan to break it into phases for in-depth design and coding (but it could still be deployed all together when complete). 

  


We would like to invite you to enter the In-Depth Design phase if you would like to continue the process.
