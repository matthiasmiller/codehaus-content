15\. Initial Information

Standard Questions for Each Design: 

  


1\. On a scale of 1 to 10, how important is it to access the software from a mobile device, such as a phone or tablet? 

  * 8



  


2\. Do you want to import data from an existing software system or spreadsheets? If yes, what data (i.e. contacts, sales items, invoices, etc.)? 

  * We have all of our customer data stored in QB. If it saves us a lot of money and makes things easier we would not need to do any importing we would just start fresh, entering customers as we go.



  


3\. We offer two options for login format: A quick login using Gmail/Google accounts, and a username/password login. It can also be set up so that some users use one and others use the other. Which format would you prefer?

  * I would like it to have it's own log in, apart from Gmail or Google.



  


4\. Will you want to restrict access to certain portions of the system from some users? If so, you can be thinking through what groups of users you will want to have and what portions of the system you would like them to be able to access. 

  * I don't foresee us needing to restrict any access for this software.



  


5\. Do you want to use time tracking for employees?

  * We use a separate time tracking software. If I understood further what this all entails, we may want to have this set up.



  


6\. What would you like to call the software solution? Sometimes our clients refer to it with a generic term such as "CRM system" or "our software", but some clients like to give their solution a more specific name. It's nice to give it a name or description that is and easy to use. We don't need this right away, but you can be thinking about this as we get started on the design.

  * I'm not particular on the name but I would prefer to maybe give it a generic name to reference it rather than calling it "the system".
