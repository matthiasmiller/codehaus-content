Development Specification

Solution Name / Subdomain / Client Code: (included in the "Various questions" email in [[[W0312](https://zch.apphosting.zone/Detail/Edit/2?RecordType=WikiPages&NumberID=-313&)]] - 13. High-Level Design Prep Emails)

TODO_AM: [ ] Determine a preliminary project name and subdomain (helpful for shorthand reference in the design phase; possibly used the same for reference longer-term)

  * We like to have an internal name to refer to the project. 
    * Choosing this name does not signify any commitment from either side. 
    * For consistency, we like to use the website address where your software solution would be hosting. 
    * The format is something.apphosting.zone. 
    * Sometimes it is: 
      * Simply the name of the business. 
      * The acronym of the business name. 
      * A name that you choose to assign to the software solution.
    * We're looking for something that is short, unique, memorable, and relevant. 
  * Share suggestions prepared as options or conversation starters: TODO_ 
    * ViewPoint 
      * Tim Reitz 10/23/2025: Probably "ViewPoint Delivery Management Software" as the official name, then refer to it as "ViewPoint" as the nickname / common name. 
  * Settled on:
