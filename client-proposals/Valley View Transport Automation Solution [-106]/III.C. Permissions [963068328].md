3.3. Permissions

The Solution includes various custom permissions that control visibility and/or editability of various portions of the solution, including reports, records, and parts of records. These permissions normally are enabled on a per-User Group basis, allowing all Users in a Group to access the corresponding information.

  


These permissions will be determined through further design.
