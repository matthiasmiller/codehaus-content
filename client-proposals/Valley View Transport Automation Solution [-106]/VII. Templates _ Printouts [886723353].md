7\. Templates / Printouts

The Solution has the capability to generate various printouts based on templates. These templates/printouts can fall into two main categories:

  


Basic printouts can be generated from the Advanced menu of a report. Note that the PDF versions of such printouts can be branded with the Valley View Transport logo and contact information but do not have any additional special customizations. Basic Excel files do not include the logo/branding.

  


Customized printouts are provided for various reports and/or records. CodeCrafters will take some liberty with the design of these printouts to simplify development and to compensate for technical limitations. Customized PDFs can include a complete Valley View Transport letterhead, and customized Excel printout/files can also include the logo.

  


Other Notes: 

  * Unless otherwise noted, all PDF templates are generated for "Letter" size paper (8.5" x 11").
  * Unless otherwise noted, the font for all templates is "Arial". 



  


The Solution generates the following printouts. 

  


Note that in the interest of cost reduction, the final layout for the printouts might not match the mockups (if simpler implementations are available).
