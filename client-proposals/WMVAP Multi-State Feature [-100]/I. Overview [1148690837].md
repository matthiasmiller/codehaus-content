1\. Overview

  


Requirements

Tim Reitz 08/26/2025: Marked this Proposal as "Closed" today. Sections have been documented in the Base living spec ([https://zch.apphosting.zone/Detail/Edit/2?RecordType=ClientProposals&NumberID=-20&State=ctLVLwm53iQ&#](https://zch.apphosting.zone/Detail/Edit/2?RecordType=ClientProposals&NumberID=-20&State=ctLVLwm53iQ&#)). 

  


*Documented. Tim Reitz 08/26/2025:

  


This proposal is for changes and customizations to the existing Self-Insured Vehicle Management Silverloom (SIVM) Solution, initially designed for and provided to the Weaverland Mennonite Vehicle Aid Plan of Pennsylvania. These changes allow the same base software to be duplicated and configured for other Groups who might wish to use the SIVM Solution in the future. Each Group would use their own copy of the SIVM Solution with their own configurations, but the base system would remain the same, and changes applied to the base system would be applied to all copies.

  


Development Specification

Ellis Miller 09/04/2024: BID 4 HOURS

[ ] Move all catalog contents to a "Silverloom Vehicle Insurance.txt" and all components to a "Vehicle Insurance" subfolder. We will later add some things back to ZWA/ZWI catalogs.

[ ] Include this in ZWI.

Tim Reitz 03/14/2025: Presumably under the ZWI proposal.

[ ] Add this to ZWA.

[X] _VA: Tim Reitz 03/18/2025: Add to the Proposal.

Tim Reitz 03/18/2025: Done today.

Tim Reitz 09/05/2024: Call with ZWA clients today.

  * PA is planning to work out compensation details directly with WI
  * For CRs in the works:
    * The Collision terminology changes should be done by beginning of December
    * The Units report maybe should also be included
    * Permissions for dismissing fees/credits could also be included
  * How to handle CRs in the future, once there are multiple systems?
    * Changes would normally be applied to all systems
    * Each system could make specific changes to only their own system
    * PA would be the primary partner, making the final call for shared changes
      * For minor changes, CCI would work with PA, then alert the other groups
      * For larger changes, we could pull in people from the other states for finalizing the decision
    * By default, the group who asks for a change for their own system would pay for it
    * Changes that apply to all groups usually would be billed to PA, and PA would work out compensation details among all affected groups
      * An exception would be for changes that one group wants to make, but PA isn't interested in paying for it, and it gets bounced back to the requesting group to cover the cost.
  * The other groups might really want to include the Accounting module / integration soon.
