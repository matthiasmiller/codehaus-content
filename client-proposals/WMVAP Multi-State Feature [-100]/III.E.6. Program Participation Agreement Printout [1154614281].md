It contains information about the client, the vehicle, coverages, and any "Guidelines Compliance Questions" that denote the vehicle being outside of compliance for the Plan guidelines. It also includes signature and date fields for the client, primary driver, and agent to sign, and may include a copy of the Vehicle Guidelines for the Plan.

  


Printed From: 

  * Vehicle Record: "Print Program Participation Agreement" link



  


File Format/Name: 

  * PDF: "Program Participation Agreement for Vehicle_<Year> <Make> <Model> <VIN / Serial #> (exported on <current date in the yyyy-mm-dd>"



  


Fields to be Filled: 

  


  * Header:
    * Logo (specific to the Plan) (hard-coded) (displays the "Plan Logo" from Silverloom Settings; dimensions: 500 x 108 points (max of 1.5" high, up to 6" wide) 



  


  * In the printout body:



I, <Client or Primary Contact FirstName LastName>, understand that my <Year> <Make> <Model> with VIN/Serial Number <VIN / Serial #> has been entered into the <bold font; displaying the contents of the "Plan name" System Switch> Weaverland Mennonite Vehicle Aid Plan for the purpose of obtaining the following coverage(s): 

"<Self-Insured Liability Coverage - State Minimum Coverage>" (visible if the Vehicle has active Liability Coverage)

  


"<Collision - Long label> Coverage - Initial Enrolled Coverage Amount: $<Coverage Amount>" (visible if the Vehicle has active Collision Coverage)

  


"<Cargo Coverage - Initial Enrolled Coverage Amount: $<Coverage Amount>" (visible if the Vehicle has active Cargo Coverage)

  


The Primary Driver of the vehicle is <Primary Drive FirstName LastName>.

  


I understand that this is a legal agreement between the “Plan”, known as <contents of the "Program Participation Agreement Plan Name" System Switch SI 15 (Self Insured Group #15) and the state of <contents of the "Plan state name" System Switch> Pennsylvania.

  


I understand that <Collision - Short label> (<Collision - Long label>) is strictly a mutual sharing plan among Weaverland Conference members to assist with accident related repair costs or total loss of the member’s enrolled vehicle. <Collision - Short Label> does not assist with towing, recovery or storage costs.

  


I understand that any costs incurred by accidents requiring payment will increase the costs for all the participants of this plan.

  


I will try to the best of my ability to be a safe and courteous driver.

  


I have received a copy of the <bold font; displaying the contents of the "Plan name" System Switch> Weaverland Mennonite Vehicle Aid Plan Vehicle Guidelines and agree to keep my vehicle within these Guidelines.

  


I understand these Guidelines are for all Weaverland Conference members, whether or not they participate in the Plan SI# 15 plan.

  * Includes the standard "Powered by Silverloom Business Suite" footer.
