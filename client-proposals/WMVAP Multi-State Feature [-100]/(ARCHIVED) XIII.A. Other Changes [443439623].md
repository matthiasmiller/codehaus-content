13.1. Other Changes

Tim Reitz 02/28/2025: Archiving this section, since these changes have been done separately -- in [[[IN10155](https://zch.apphosting.zone/Detail/Edit/2?RecordType=Incidents&NumberID=-10157&)]] - ZWA - Changes for "Collision" Terminology (Main Job) (prev. Minimize usage of "collision"). 

  


"Collision" Terminology: Changes also are being made to switch references to "Collision" to "Vehicle Loss Sharing" or "VLS".

  


To allow for flexibility of terminology, both with potential for additional wording changes over time and with the potential for various groups to use the software, system switches are being added to allow for configuring alternate wording: 

  * Full displayed alternate text (i.e. "Vehicle Loss Sharing") 
  * Abbreviated / short alternate text (i.e. "VLS") 
  * Legal text (i.e. "Collision") 



  


With the exception of simple lists, all visible instances of "Collision" in the software and printouts are being replaced with expressions for one of these three system switches.

  


The full design for these changes is documented separately from this proposal.
