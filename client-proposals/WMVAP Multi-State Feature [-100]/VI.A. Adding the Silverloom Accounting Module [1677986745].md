The Silverloom Accounting Module could be added to the Solution and customized to integrate with Invoices, etc. A user login account could be created for a CPA to perform financial audits.

  * Coding / Customizations: $20,000-30,000 (T&M) 
    * Includes: 
      * Integrating the auto side and the accounting side together
      * Additional customizations 
    * The final number could be more or less, depending on the final scope of work and related complexity. 
  * Setup fee for accounting module (per Group/system): $2,500 (fixed price) 
  * Monthly fee for accounting module with unlimited # of users (per Group/system): $195/month
