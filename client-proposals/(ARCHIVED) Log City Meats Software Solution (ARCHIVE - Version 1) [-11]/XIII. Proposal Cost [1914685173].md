13\. Proposal Cost

Custom Solution

  


CodeCrafters provides custom software solutions using AppHosting.zone's hosted software platform. There is an upfront cost for the custom application and a monthly subscription that covers hosting and support. CodeCrafters is offering the custom solution with two payment options:

  


  * Upfront Payment -- this provides a lower ongoing subscription cost with a higher up-front payment. Extra support and feature enhancements are billed separately.
  * Premium Subscription -- this provides a lower up-front cost with a monthly subscription that includes additional support and ongoing development and enhancements to the system.

* CodeCrafters will work with the client to set up and configure the messaging service. It will be billed directly to the client. Messaging rates may vary based on the carrier and location.

  


Support

CodeCrafters provides standard next-business-day email support. This includes answering general questions from the senior users and supporting standard use of the product. Our engineers will typically respond by email or phone by the next business day. If a request goes beyond standard support, requiring additional application customization or premium support, we will offer you that option.

  


For urgent issues, CodeCrafters will provide a phone number for premium support. The Premium subscription includes unlimited premium support. For the Upfront Payment option, premium support is billed at $50 / incident in 30 minute increments. If the issue is found to be caused by a CodeCrafters/AppHosting.zone problem, it will not be billed.

  


Changes and Enhancements

When deploying the system, CodeCrafters will provide the client an opportunity to use the system and provide feedback on features. CodeCrafters will attempt to integrate requested changes as part of the project. If requests go beyond the scope of the project, CodeCrafters will discuss with the client how these should be prioritized. 

  


The premium subscription includes ongoing system development and enhancements as part of the subscription. We expect many of your enhancements to fall within the scope of the Premier Subscription. Some major enhancements may fall outside of this scope. In these situations, we will work with you to design the features and provide a fixed-price proposal.
