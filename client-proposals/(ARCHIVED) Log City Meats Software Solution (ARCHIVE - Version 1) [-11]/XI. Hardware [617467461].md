11\. Hardware

  


Requirements

We will help find and set up the hardware for the operation. This includes:

  


  * Two laptops at the sales counter
  * A thermal printer (ribbon/thermal transfer) to print on a heavy tag/label. This could be similar to the hunting license--perforated roll with sections that fit into a wallet.
  * A waterproof tablet/kiosk where they are cut/processed
  * A waterproof tablet/kiosk where they are packaged
  * A firewalled router for kiosks to access the system. The kiosks are close to the office (or 100ft across the room without walls), so wireless transmission will not be a problem. The routers will not allow the kiosks to access the Internet.



  


We recommend that the laptops at the sales counter will be set up with four printers:

  * Print to PDF (default printer to avoid printing to wrong device)
  * Thermal Printer #1 (with a custom name indicating deboned orders)
  * Thermal Printer #2 (with a custom name indicating bone-in orders)
  * Regular Printer (with a custom name indicating for invoices)



  


The kiosks will all share the same interface, allowing to switch between a Deboning, Processing, or Packaging view. This way, all details can be updated at any station.

  


Note that the office already has a computer and regular printer.

  


The hardware will be priced separately. If possible, we would like to partner with a local IT Professional for hardware installation, setup, and ongoing support.

Matthias Miller 06/10/2019: We will direct bill the hardware to them.

  * Is there an IT guy he uses to help with the setup?
  * We need to make sure these can get security updates, but it may give access to downloads from the play store -- or can we use parental controls to lock them down?
  * These will be billed separately.
  * Matthias can send out an email to Anabaptist.tech
    * Matthias Miller 06/12/2019: What about label height? How many line items?
      * It's big enough that if we adjust the font a little bit -- we can get --
      * Name the printers



IT shop that they work with -- not sure where 

  


  


Ellis Miller 06/10/2019: Are we automating the printing or just doing a PDF export and they manually print that twice?

Matthias Miller 06/10/2019: Tell him his option:

  * Set default printer to PDF/XPS, then have 3 printer options for bone-in, deboned, and invoice
  * We can evaluate a year from now, if it's an issue.
  * Does he want a logo on it?
  * Can we do a fixed height?
