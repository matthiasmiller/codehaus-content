4\. Disallow Collision Coverage Amount of $0

  


Requirements

Design: 

  * Add a warning on the Coverage Amount field if the amount is $0
  * Also hide the Activate button if the amount is $0
  * Do this for both Collision and Cargo coverages



  


Note: This will not affect existing coverages with $0 amounts, but will prevent it from being done in the future.

  


T&M Estimate: $100-200
