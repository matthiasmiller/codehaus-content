10\. Add an Income Report from Invoices

  


Requirements

The Liability and Collision Income Report was designed and built to look at the Fees and Credits on the vehicles. However, if an invoice is edited, those changes are not reflected on the Liability and Collision Income Report.

  


The current proposal is to have two complimentary reports:

  * One report running on fees/credits for clients and vehicles, showing the appropriate totals for for the specified date ranges. This shows the fees and credits amounts. (This is the current Liability and Collision Income Report)
  * One report running on invoices, showing the appropriate totals for the specified date ranges. This shows the invoiced amounts. (This would be a new report)



  


Both of these reports have certain weaknesses/gaps, but having both would give the opportunity for comparison if desired. The first one was part of the original package; the second would be an additional feature. 

  


T&M Estimate: Approximately $500
