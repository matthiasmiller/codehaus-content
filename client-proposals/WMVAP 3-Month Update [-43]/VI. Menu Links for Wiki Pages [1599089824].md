6\. Menu Links for Wiki Pages

  


Requirements

There are various PDF documents to upload and access in the software. An easy option is to simply add them to the Wiki pages, but there is the concern that agents will forget where to go to access them.

  


Design/plan:

  * These PDFs would be saved to individual Wiki page(s)
  * Menu options would be added that would link directly to the specific Wiki page(s)



  


T&M Estimate: $50-100
