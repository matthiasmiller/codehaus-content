5\. Use Capital Letters for VIN and License Plate

  


Requirements

Full version: Auto-capitalize any letters that are entered into the VIN/Serial # field and License Plate field on the Vehicle records.

  


T&M Estimate: $250-500

  


  


Simplified version: Add validation to not allow the user to save the Vehicle record if there are lower-case letters in the VIN/Serial # field and License Plate field (this would require manually entering them as capitals).

  


T&M Estimate: Approximately $100
