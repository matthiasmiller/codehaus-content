2\. Add Ability to Select Multiple Periods for Loss Payable Clause

  


Requirements

This provides a way to select from multiple Collision coverages for the Loss Payable Clause printout. Currently it simply prints with the starting date of the current Collision coverage.

  


Design: Use essentially the same approach that we use for the Liability coverages and Insurance Card / Liability Declaration Page printouts: 

  * Clicking "Loss Payable Clause" should open a prompt like the one for the Insurance Card/Declaration Page printouts. 
  * This prompt should show a list of Collision coverages for the vehicle. 
  * The Loss Payable printout stays the same as it is currently, other than the "From" date should update according to the selected period on the prompt rather than always being the starting date of the coverage. 



  


T&M Estimate: $300-500
