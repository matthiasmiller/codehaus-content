8.1.12. Contract Record: "Other" fees

Seth Miller 01/07/2026: 

[ ] x30 button to incur a fee. (amount from fees rg)

  


[ ] design a way to add Other Fees to the contract

Seth Miller 11/14/2025: Specifically we need to have a way to Incur an "other" fee

Matthias Miller 12/03/2025: No, but Duane would like to lock down the usable fees on the contract definition to only the ones that are set up in the accounting company if we are tied out to an RTO company. If you're an Admin, you can only add any additional contract fees that are also available on the contract definition. (Only the Admin can modify fees on the contract.)

  


TODO_SETH: We need a way for admins to edit the fees RG.
