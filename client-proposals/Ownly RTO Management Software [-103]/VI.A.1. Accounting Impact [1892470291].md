6.1.1. Accounting Impact

TODO_SETH:

What do we want to do if there's a revenue account not listed for a fee type? Presumably fail the nightly process?

Matthias Miller 12/04/2025: Yes. One idea is to push as much as we can then have an import at the end that triggers a failure. Another option is just a report alert. Let's chat to figure out what we love and hate about Assist's approach.

  


  


  * "Bill Payment" / Vendor Invoice



  


  * Transit Task
    * Expense
      * Freight
      * Repo Expense



  


  * Canceled Building (between contract & delivery)
    * Example:
      * Building was entered on Jul 31 didn't get delivered
      * On Aug 26, need to reverse depreciation
