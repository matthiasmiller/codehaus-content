11.0.0.5. Contract Entry

TODO_SETH - we think this is ready to delegate

  


  * Contract Entry
    * Dashboard
      * Prompt for Contact (include address + phone + email; blank = new contact)
      * Prompt for Product (include Primary ID; blank = new product)
    * Three Panes
      * Left Pane - Contact
      * Middle Pane - Product
      * Right Pane - Contract (always a new one)
