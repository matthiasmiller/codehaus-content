7.1. S3 setup

Seth Miller 01/05/2026: Catalog changes are done except disabling document archive and permissions

TODO_SETH: We want to disable document archive on all database levels. I don't know how we want to handle user profiles / user groups.

Seth Miller 01/13/2026: TODO_Sean: for disabling document archive [[PC0188309]]

  


[ ] Set up S3 account Seth Miller 01/05/2026: Per Josh's email on 12/6 this is already set up for the test system.

[ ] Permissions droplist for visibility.

[ ] Customer

[ ] Standard Staff

[ ] Super Admin

Matthias Miller 12/04/2025: Let's call it "Visibility"

  


  


TODO_PERMISSIONS: finalize the permissions list. Make sure this makes sense for all the places we have attachments

  


Matthias Miller 12/04/2025: Everything needs to come in as Standard Staff. (NOTE: This means that sensitive documents will be available for a brief moment after uploading, before the user restricts it.)

  


Where we need S3:

[X] Contract Attachments 

[X] Contact Drivers License

  


  * Secure Document Handling for SSNs and/or driver’s licenses
