Duane Burkholder 08/07/2025: DONE_SETH: This will change and morph so I am a bit nervous about starting to Spec this but I expect I can nail some of these. FYI I do not expect the menu's to have the number. 😊

Duane Burkholder 08/11/2025: DONE_SETH: Could we have Sean mockup the menu at some point so I could play around with moving things around? For the time being I am going to mark this TODO as done.

Seth Miller 09/03/2025: DONE_SEAN. Mockup the menu as specced below. Note items we have on the menu that are not here.
