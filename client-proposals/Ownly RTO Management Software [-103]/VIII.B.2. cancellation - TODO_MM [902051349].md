8.2.2. cancellation - TODO_MM

Important notes:

  * Contract Start Date is date of delivery to the customer
  * We cannot incur the first invoice until that date...
  * Proposal:
    * "Initial Payment" account on the contract just like CRA and Customer Deposit



  


  * Cancel prior to contract start date ; after that it's a close
    * ‘
    * can't cancel a building without reconciling the payments; cannot cancel it with a started contract
    * cannot start a contract with a canceled building



  


  


  * You cannot cancel a contract with any payments applied to any invoices (or any payments that are not fully refunded)
    * THEN, upon cancelation:
      * Create check for any non-credit card payments
      * 


  


  * Payment Type for
    * Amount Held from Seller (lives in Account Payable until it's applied to a contract)



  


  


  * You cannot cancel an asset with non-zero balances:
    * Asset - COULD show the amount held from seller & the balance still needing to be applied...
