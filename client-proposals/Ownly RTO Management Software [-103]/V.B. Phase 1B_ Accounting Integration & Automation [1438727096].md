5.2. Phase 1B: Accounting Integration & Automation

Accounting integration has been important to prospects. This includes automation for:

  


  * Income Statement
    * Revenue
    * Expenses
  * Balance Sheet; key events such as:
    * Contract Signature
    * Building Built
    * Building Delivered
    * Building Paid
    * Building Retrieved
    * Contract Ended/Canceled



  


We will also need to import Stripe Payouts (or whatever processor we use) so that we can tie out batches.
