Requirements

Support will likely be provided with three tiers:

  * Full Database Access for Ownly RTO
  * Day Passes for Ownly RTO
  * No Database Access for Ownly RTO (On Your Own / Screen Share / Pay Per Incident)



The software would have two links:

  * Enable Ownly RTO Day Pass (available to administrators; prompts for members of the Ownly RTO Support group; temporarily enables that user account; all group members are disabled nightly)
  * Share Screen with Ownly RTO (link to [https://ownlyrto.com/support](https://ownlyrto.com/support) to redirect to TeamViewer or some other remote access app).
