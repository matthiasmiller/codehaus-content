1.3.4. Balloon Payments

We have fielding for balloon payment settings but need details on how it should work.

  


The final payment on a NC balloon payment has be more than 10%.

  * Autopay should not run if it's going to take it less than 10% (i.e. it should fail)



  


  


  


TODO_DB - Duane needs to see if other states require a balloon payment. NC we can just put it into a security deposit and never charge a late fee.
