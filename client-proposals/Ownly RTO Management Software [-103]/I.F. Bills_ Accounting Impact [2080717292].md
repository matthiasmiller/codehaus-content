1.6. Bills: Accounting Impact

Seth Miller 01/13/2026: Copying this from the Bill spec.

  


TODO_MM:

  * For accounting impact, create A/P adjustments based on the Product RG and the Sales Tax Liability RG, then have an A/P + banking adjustment for the bill itself.



Seth Miller 01/13/2026: note that we no longer have a sales tax liability RG on the bill record.
