8.1.2.1. Run Autopay

Seth Miller 12/17/2025: Jonathan is working on this in [[PC0187843]]

  


  * Payment record
    * Add a checkbox for logging that it was an automatic payment (maybe link it to contract + RG row ID?)
  * Add Date/Time that it was run (could be when we fill in the confirmation ID)
  * Figure out a way to run this ~11pm Seth Miller 12/16/2025: or 1 am?
