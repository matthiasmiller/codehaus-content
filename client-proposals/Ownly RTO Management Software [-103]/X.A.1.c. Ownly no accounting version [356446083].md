10.0.1.3. Ownly no accounting version

TODO_SETH - We need to create a no-accounting version of ZRT so that we can test inclusion/exclusion of these fields.

TODO_SETH - I think we will need to use RTO Company to link Bills/Invoices so that we can include them in non-accounting systems

TODO_SETH - We need to support Credit Card Payments to an invoice by Spring

NOTE: There are 3 levels:

  * No Accounting in the system at all
  * System with Accounting but WITHOUT Accounting Impact for an RTO company
  * System with Accounting but WITH Accounting Impact for an RTO company
