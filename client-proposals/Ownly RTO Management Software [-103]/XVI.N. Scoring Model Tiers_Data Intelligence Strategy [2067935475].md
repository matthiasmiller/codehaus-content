16.14. Scoring Model Tiers/Data Intelligence Strategy

Scoring Model Tiers and Data Intelligence Strategy

In the long term, the platform will support a flexible scoring system with three distinct levels of data intelligence:

  


Basic Internal Scoring

  * Uses internal data like payment history, references, and onboarding details
  * Great for getting started with no external dependencies



  


Cooperative (Co-op) Model

  * Participating Rental Companies anonymously share customer payment data
  * Creates a stronger shared model
  * This co-op model could be the most affordable due to distributed cost and shared insights



  


Private Data Vendor Integration

  * An Rental Company can choose to integrate with a third-party data vendor but only with their own customer data
  * Enhances risk modeling privacy



  


Companies can choose the level that fits their priorities—speed, privacy, or power—giving them complete control over how much intelligence they want to build into their collections strategy.
