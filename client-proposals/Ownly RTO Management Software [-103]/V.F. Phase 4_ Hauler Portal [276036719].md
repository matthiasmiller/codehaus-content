5.6. Phase 4: Hauler Portal

This phase will include a Hauler Portal, allowing haulers to see what is happening with the building.

  


It will also allow handling basic account details, such as the contract, last date and amount of payment, and the minimum payment required to cancel a retrieval. (This minimum payment will be set when scheduling a retrieval.)

  


Providing account information makes it easy to have a conversation with the customer when they say, “Oh, I just made my payment yesterday!”

  


In addition, the hauler can immediately transact a payment if the customer wants to catch up their payment.
