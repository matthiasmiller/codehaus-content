12.4.13. Product Resale Methods List

This is a custom non-editable simple list used to track Product Resale Methods.

  


It includes the following items: 

  * Resell
  * Buyback



  


This list is universal for all users.

  


Note that this sequence is static, so it should always be displayed in this sequence throughout the Solution.

  


This list will be set up by CodeCrafters as part of the main development. If changes need to be made to this list, it will require some coding work.
