Useful Life (drop-list of Fixed Length, Contract Length)

  


This is a custom non-editable simple list used in the Depreciation Schedules embedded spreadsheet on Rental Company Contact records. 

  


It includes the following items: 

  * Fixed Length
  * Contract Length



  


This list is universal for all users.

  


Note that this sequence is static, so it should always be displayed in this sequence throughout the Solution.

  


This list will be set up by CodeCrafters as part of the main development. If changes need to be made to this list, it will require some coding work.
