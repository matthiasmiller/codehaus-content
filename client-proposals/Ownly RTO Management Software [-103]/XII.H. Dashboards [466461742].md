12.8. Dashboards

Duane Burkholder 07/31/2025: TODO_IDD I have been messing around with reformatting the "My Notes" report and also building one that will go into the dashboard in the future. I made a folder under user folders called "NOTES".

Proposal for Free Cash

\- What RTO Pro calls "Free Cash" we should call "Deferred Rent"

  * Do we need to push this to accounting? Duane doesn't think so.
  * NOTE: These can be expressions on the RG, but can be displayed on the main detail screen. (I think so..this would be required for the dashboard.)
  * Deferred Rent (# of Days)
  * Deferred Rent ($)
    * = "What SHOULD they have paid for the current due date" minus "What HAVE they currently paid"



\- We should have a dashboard for Deferred Rent with bar graphs that you can drill down into...
