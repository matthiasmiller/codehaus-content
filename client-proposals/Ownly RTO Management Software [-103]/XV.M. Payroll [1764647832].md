15.13. Payroll

It’s possible that down the road, we’ll consider payroll integration, but the value add is not immediately clear, given the cost. This could be broken down into phases such as:

  


  * Time Tracking (PTO)
  * Manual integration (simple screen that shows the payroll liability, with an easy way to enter the taxes for expense reporting)
  * Full whitelabel / integration
