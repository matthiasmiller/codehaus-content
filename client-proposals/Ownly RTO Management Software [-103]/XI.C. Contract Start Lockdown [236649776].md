11.3. Contract Start Lockdown

Editing post contract start:

  * Proposal: a button visible for super admins (TODO_Permissions) to allow editing.
  * This would turn off after the first save. They could push the button again if they need to.
  * TODO_IDD: what fields are reasonable to normally be editable after contract start (i.e. transfer contract, payments RG, etc)
