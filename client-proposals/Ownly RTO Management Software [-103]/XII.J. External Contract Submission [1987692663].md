Duane Burkholder 12/22/2025: some things to think about

  * I wonder about building this as a WSGI so that an RTO company does not have to balloon users/user costs
  * Promo's assigned to dealers, sales reps, or manufacturers
    * $99 down for x period of time kind of thing
  * Product based limitations 
    * We may need to think about creating a product type record that could embody additional restrictions
      * Decks require 3 payments down
      * Dog Kennels require 4 payments down
  * Ability to set up a simple auto pay and store the customer payment method
  * Ability to pick due date
