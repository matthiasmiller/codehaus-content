It includes the following items: 

  


  * Grade A - Brand New
  * Grade B - Like New
  * Grade C - Very Good
  * Grade D - Fair / Usable
  * Grade E - Needs Work
  * Grade F - Salvage Only



  


This list is universal for all users.

This list will be set up by CodeCrafters as part of the main development. If changes need to be made to this list, it will require some coding work.
