10.1.2. My Notes

  * Duane Burkholder 07/30/2025: DONE_Seth: I am thinking that my notes may need a check box to include notes I created that were needing follow up and are not yet completed. I think I would then want them to be grouped based on Assigned to Me and Created by me. When the box would be checked it should unhide a column that shows who the assignee is. There may be value in defaulting it to always show both so I would be interested in your thoughts.



Seth Miller 10/13/2025: TODO_DB: can My Notes just use the standard search notes report but default the ask prompts? We would need to update the design to accommodate your above suggestion
