12.2. Contract Definition Record Validation

[ ] Make sure the expected fields are required / have a warning on save. Especially thinking about setting up a record

  * Matthias Miller 12/03/2025: Let's kick it to Spring. A good idea would be to add a warning on save, but add an Active checkbox that forcibly requires them. This way you can start setting them up in invalid states, but need to clean it up to take it live



  


Matthias Miller 12/03/2025: Duane would like to defer this to Spring, since he will be the one doing most of the setup
