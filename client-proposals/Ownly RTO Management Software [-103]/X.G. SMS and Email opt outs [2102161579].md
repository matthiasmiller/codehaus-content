10.6. SMS and Email opt outs

Seth Miller 10/17/2025: TODO_IDD

  


  * "SMS Opt-In" checkbox (visible only for Mobile types; not editable in detail screen)
  * This will be synced with Twilio (we can defer the x30 for this) - also what to do if someone opts in / out without a contact record (?!)



  


  * TODO_PERMISSIONS - Make this editable to the highest permission level so that when someone opts in by email we can flip the switch
