6.9. Payment Categories List

  


Requirements

This is a custom non-editable simple list used to track categories of Payment records. It includes the following items: 

  


  * Buyer 
  * Member



  


This list is universal for all users.

  


Note that this sequence is static, so it should always be displayed in this sequence throughout the Solution.

  


This list will be set up by CCI as part of the main development. If changes need to be made to this list, it will require some coding work.

  


Other Notes: 

  * Note that this could eventually also include a "Freight" category, for handling standalone Freight payments.
