6.8. Other Line Item Types List

  


Requirements

This is a custom non-editable simple list used to track the "Type" for rows on the "Other Line Item" table on the Delivery Ticket. It includes the following items: 

  


  * Freight 
  * Fee 
  * Credit
  * Discount 
  * Other 



  


This list is universal for all users.

  


Note that this sequence is static, so it should always be displayed in this sequence throughout the Solution.

  


This list will be set up by CCI as part of the main development. If changes need to be made to this list, it will require some coding work.
