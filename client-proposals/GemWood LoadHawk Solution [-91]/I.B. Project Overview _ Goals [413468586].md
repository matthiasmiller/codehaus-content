1.2. Project Overview / Goals

The purpose of this Solution is to provide GemWood with the tools they need to efficiently and accurately handle the back-office processes, allowing them to scale their operations with less effort. As noted below, this Solution may be built out in phases, to deliver the foundational pieces first and add more features later. The Solution is provided via CodeCrafters' Silverloom Business Suite, and has been given the nickname "LoadHawk".
