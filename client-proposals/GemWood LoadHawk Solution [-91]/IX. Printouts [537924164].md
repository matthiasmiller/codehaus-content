9\. Printouts

  


Requirements

The LoadHawk Solution generates various printouts based on templates. These templates/printouts can fall into two main categories:

  


Basic printouts can be generated from the Advanced menu of a report. Note that the PDF versions of such printouts can be branded with the GemWood logo and contact information but do not have any additional special customizations. Basic Excel files do not include the logo/branding.

  


Customized printouts are provided for various reports and/or records. CodeCrafters will take some liberty with the design of these printouts to simplify development and to compensate for technical limitations. Customized PDFs can include a complete GemWood letterhead, and customized Excel printout/files can also include the logo.

  


The Solution generates the following printouts. 

  


Note that in the interest of cost reduction, the final layout for the printouts for Phase 1 might not match the mockups (if simpler implementations are available).
