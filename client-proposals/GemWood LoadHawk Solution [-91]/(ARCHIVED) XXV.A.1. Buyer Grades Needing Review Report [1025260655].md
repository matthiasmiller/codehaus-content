25.1.1. Buyer Grades Needing Review Report

  


Requirements

_DD: Tim Reitz 10/23/2024: What information would you want to track here? 

Tim Reitz 11/07/2024: Are we directly tracking an approval for the Buyer Grade PDFs? 

Tim Reitz 12/04/2024: As of today, we don't think we need this any more. 

  


: Tim Reitz 10/23/2024: I'm thinking this is probably a report of RG rows that do not have the "Buyer Grade Approved" set... 

  


: Tim Reitz 11/07/2024: Maybe is just a version of the Buyer Grade Attachments report.

HLD notes:
