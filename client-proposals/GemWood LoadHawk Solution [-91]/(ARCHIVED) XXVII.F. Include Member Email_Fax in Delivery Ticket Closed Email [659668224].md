27.6. Include Member Email/Fax in Delivery Ticket Closed Email

Sean Miller 04/29/2025: Moved to [[[IN11424](https://zch.apphosting.zone/Detail/Edit/2?RecordType=Incidents&NumberID=-11426&)]] - ZGW - Include Member Email/Fax in Delivery Ticket Closed Email

  


  


Delivery Ticket Closed Email (merge & default email body): This email could include a line with the Member's email address (or fax number if no email) when the "Manually forward web link attachments" checkbox is checked on the Member's Contact record. This would make it easier for the GemWood user to forward the email on to the Member after attaching the file. 

  


Estimated Cost: Approximately $100.
