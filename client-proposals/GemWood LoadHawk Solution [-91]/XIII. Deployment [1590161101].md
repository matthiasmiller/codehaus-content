13\. Deployment

General Configuration: The following details are to be configured as part of system setup at deployment. These are to be done either by CCI or as a joint effort between the CCI support team and GemWood: 

  * ☐  Set up the Solution to use the Username/Password login format 
  * ☐  Configure the Silverloom Settings, including the email body memos (see the corresponding spec) 
  * ☐  Configure the System Switches (as needed) 
  * ☐  Configure automatic processes, including setting up Scheduled Tasks and enabling Database Triggers as needed (see the corresponding spec) 
  * ☐  Configure S3 integration & storage (see the corresponding spec) 
  * ☐  Configure User Groups (see the corresponding spec) 
  * ☐  Configure Contact Types (see the corresponding spec) 
  * ☐  Configure other Configuration records as needed (see the corresponding spec) 
  * ☐ Configure outbound email settings (SMTP, etc.) 
  * etc



  


Training details: CodeCrafters will provide support and training for users, especially primary users, throughout the deployment of the software. 

  


This proposal assumes a total of up to 10 hours of support & training time during the deployment process. Additional time beyond that may be billed on a per-hour/T&M basis. 

  


Primary / "Full Access" users may be given access to the dedicated test system prior to deployment to allow for practicing and learning the system. 

  


Final details are to be determined, but this may include Zoom calls, recorded video walkthroughs, phone calls, emails, and/or written documentation.
