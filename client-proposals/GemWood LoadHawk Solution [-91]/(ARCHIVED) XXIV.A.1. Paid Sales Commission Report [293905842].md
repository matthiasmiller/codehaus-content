24.1.1. Paid Sales Commission Report

_VA: Tim Reitz 10/24/2024: if the client wants 2 separate reports, let's have this be the unpaid report, with the status filter set to paid. 

Tim Reitz 11/06/2024: Deactivating this for now, since we're including all commission on a single report for now.

HLD notes:
