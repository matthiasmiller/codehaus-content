8.5.7. Grade Reports to Send to Members Report

  


Requirements

Overview: This is a custom, editable multi-pane report of Closed Delivery Tickets for which Buyer Grade Reports have not been sent to the Member (i.e. "Status" = "Closed" and "Buyer Grade Report Sent to Member" checkbox is not checked), and the corresponding Buyer Grade Attachments.

  


A user can utilize this report to send the grade report details to the Member: 

  * Open the report. 
  * For each row (Delivery Ticket), open and download the file(s) in the right pane. 
  * Attach the files to an email/fax to the member, along with other information as needed from the left pane of the report. 
  * When the email is sent, check the "Buyer Grade Report Sent to Member" checkbox for the row on the report, to mark the Ticket.
