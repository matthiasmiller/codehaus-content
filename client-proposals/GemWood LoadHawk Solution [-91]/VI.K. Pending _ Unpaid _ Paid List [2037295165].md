6.11. Pending / Unpaid / Paid List

  


Requirements

This is a custom non-editable simple list used to track various things:

  * Sales Commission Status
  * Internal Fee Payouts Status
  * Possibly others in the future



  


It includes the following items: 

  


  * Pending
  * Unpaid
  * Paid



  


This list is universal for all users.

  


Note that this sequence is static, so it should always be displayed in this sequence throughout the Solution.

  


This list will be set up by CCI as part of the main development. If changes need to be made to this list, it will require some coding work.
