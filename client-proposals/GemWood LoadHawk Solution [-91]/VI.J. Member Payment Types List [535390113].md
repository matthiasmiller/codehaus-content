6.10. Member Payment Types List

  


Requirements

This is a custom non-editable simple list used to track types of payments made to Members, and for individual line items on a Member Payment. It includes the following items: 

  


  * Early Payment (used for the initial Member Payment for Delivery Tickets with Member Terms with "Uses Optional Early Payment" checkbox checked)
  * Balance Payment (used for all other Member Payments for Delivery Tickets)
  * Applied Overpayment (used for documenting applied overpayments from other Delivery Tickets on a Member Payment) 



  


This list is universal for all users.

  


Note that this sequence is static, so it should always be displayed in this sequence throughout the Solution.

  


This list will be set up by CCI as part of the main development. If changes need to be made to this list, it will require some coding work.
