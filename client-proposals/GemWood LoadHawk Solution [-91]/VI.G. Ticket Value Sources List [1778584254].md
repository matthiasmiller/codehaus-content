6.7. Ticket Value Sources List

This is a custom non-editable simple list used to track the source of the "Ticket Value $" for Delivery Tickets. It includes the following items: 

  


  * Total Buyer Payment $
  * Buyer Grade $
  * Buyer Invoice $



  


This list is universal for all users.

  


Note that this sequence is static, so it should always be displayed in this sequence throughout the Solution.

  


This list will be set up by CCI as part of the main development. If changes need to be made to this list, it will require some coding work.
