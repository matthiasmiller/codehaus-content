1.1. GemWood Overview

GemWood specializes in connecting member sawmills with buyers looking for specific lumber. GemWood functions as somewhat of a cooperative, rather than an open brokerage. In addition to brokering lumber sales, GemWood also provides training and other benefits to member sawmills.

  


GemWood is looking for a software solution to track Members (sawmills) and Buyers, as well as the process of ordering lumber, tracking species and grades, tracking purchase orders, creating and tracking delivery tickets, and tracking payments.
