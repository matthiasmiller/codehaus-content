18.1. Phase 1 IDD Additional Considerations

\-----------------

HLD notes: 

  


These are items that were briefly discussed during the Design Review call. Note that these items are not included in the pricing estimate and will be discussed in more detail during the In-Depth Design.

  


  * Grade report 



_DD: Tim Reitz 10/22/2024: What do you have in mind here? 

Tim Reitz 12/06/2024: Let's show him what we have for grade reports / reporting, and see if that covers what he would want / need. 

Client 1/1: When you refer to reporting on grade, I assume you are talking about sending the grade reports from the buyer to the member.  If that is what you are asking, I would like to somehow notify the software that we have forwarded the Grade report to the member.  Since we can’t send a link, I think we will have to send those manually and simply record them as sent to member in the software.

Tim Reitz 01/02/2025: I was asking because I have a note that simply says "Grade report" from when we were moving from the initial High-Level Design with Matthias into the In-Depth Design, but there wasn't more information there regarding what that should entail. But that suggestion of marking the Buyer Grade Report as sent to the Member sounds like a good idea. For Phase 1, we could replace the option to send the Delivery Ticket Closed email (which includes the Buyer Grade Report link) with a checkbox + date for "Grade Report sent to Member". 

  * Pay Remittance 



_DD: Tim Reitz 10/22/2024: What does this refer to? The internal fee payouts, or something else?

_VA: Tim Reitz 12/06/2024: Client thinks this was regarding sending the info to the Member upon payment - the Maybe Payment Issued email. So this actually was included at the start of the IDD.

  * QuickBooks integration



_DD: Tim Reitz 12/06/2024: Still interested in this at some point?

_VA: Tim Reitz 12/06/2024: Client isn't sure about this yet. He thinks he'll need to use the software for a while to see what they're putting in and getting out of it. So this would be a possible future item.
