1.5. Buyer Payments Overview

The Buyer Payment record tracks details about an incoming payment from a Buyer. The general overview is as follows: 

  


  * GemWood sends an invoice to the Buyer. 
  * Buyer sends payment via ACH or check. These payments often include funds for multiple Delivery Tickets that the Buyer has received. The amount applied to a Delivery Ticket may be greater than, less than, or equal to the invoice that GemWood sent. 
    * If greater than the invoice, the Buyer has graded the load at a higher grade than the Member did, and is paying according to their own grade. 
    * If less than the invoice, the Buyer has graded the load at a lower grade than the Member did, and/or took an early pay discount and/or is making a partial payment on the Ticket. 
  * When GemWood receives the payment, a user sets up a new Buyer Payment record to document it. This record is marked as "Complete" upon the first save, since the funds usually already are in the bank and the payment complete. However, the user can change the Payment record status if further negotiations or investigations are needed.
