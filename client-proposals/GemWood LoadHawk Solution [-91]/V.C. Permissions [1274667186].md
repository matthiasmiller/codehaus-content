5.3. Permissions

  


Requirements

The Solution includes various permissions that control access to / visibility of various portions of the Solution, including reports, records, and parts of records. These permissions are enabled on a per-User Group basis, allowing all users in that group to access the corresponding information.

  


Users in the "Full Access" user group have full access to the whole system.

  


The table below lists the permissions and the user groups that will have the corresponding permissions enabled:
