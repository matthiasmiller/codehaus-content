26.2. In-Field Tablet for Delivery Tickets

Sean Miller 04/30/2025: Moved to [[[IN11440](https://zch.apphosting.zone/Detail/Edit/2?RecordType=Incidents&NumberID=-11442&)]] - ZGW - In-Field Tablet for Delivery Tickets

  


  


This is a potential "Phase 2a" item.

  


This feature would introduce GemWood-owned tablets that are locked down to only be able to access a portal for the Members. It would require offline access and syncing, running off a data plan.

  


The first part of this would be to allow Members to enter and submit Delivery Tickets.

  


Note that Members should only be able to see Buyers and PO's that are related to their current loads.
