Ben Reitz 09/06/2024: Ellis and I had our call with Dane today. Call notes: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/14A4OCVmeqDd-fPZPW9mJvP_5a-n-VNOC8Je_i_H0WVQ/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14A4OCVmeqDd-fPZPW9mJvP_5a-n-VNOC8Je_i_H0WVQ/edit)

  


Summary:

Overview:

  * Located in Kentucky
  * Essentially a lumber broker that finds buyers for specialty types of sawn lumber
  * Also train sawmills how to cut the specialty lumber
  * Generating about a million dollars of revenue / month
  * Has sawmills throughout the country
  * Has a salesman (Frederick) who travels the country to find buyers
  * Not doing much marketing; just relying on Frederick to bring customers to them
  * Currently using QuickBooks and Excel to track everything
  * Looking for a new system that is a little more automated and less mistake prone
  * Current process:
    * Receive a purchase order from buyer (via Frederick)
    * PO is usually pretty sparse on details so it usually sits there until details are ironed out
    * Frederick decides what sawmills saw the wood
    * Once a load leaves the sawmill, Dane takes over
    * Dane receives a delivery ticket (Gem Wood format)
    * The information on the delivery ticket is used to generate the invoice to the buyer and the bill to the supplier
    * Payment is handled through ACH
  * Most suppliers have internet but a few are ibyfax and one is fax only
  * Processing about 20 delivery tickets a week



  


Thoughts from Ellis:

  * We would love to work with you on this project
  * This would likely be a medium-sized project but could be a small one



  


Next Steps:

  * Ben will send design overview and system screenshots; will also mail a brochure
  * Dane is ready to move forward with a HLD but wants to make sure the rest of his team is on board before fully committing
  * Ben will call Dane on Tuesday (9/10) to see if he's ready to pay the first half of the payment



  


Ben Reitz 09/10/2024: Talked to Dane today. He said they're ready to move forward with a HLD. I collected payment for the first half.

  


He has a few questions:

  * There's another software that has the ability to take a picture of a card that's attached to the end of the lumber (essentially an auto-tally system). Would we have the capability to do this?
    * I told him that we could do some form of this, but that it would likely be a later phase item. He agreed that it shouldn't be part of Phase 1.
  * Do we have the capability to auto-send alerts to specific people? Invoices are sent to the salesman for review / approval before getting sent to the customer. Having the ability to auto-send invoices whenever one is ready to be reviewed would be very helpful. 
    * I told him we have stuff like this baked into the system already so it would just be a matter of created the correct notification for something like this. Note: since the salesman is on the road, he's using his phone most of the time. Having an email alert with a PDF of the invoice attached would be the best option here.
  * Along with the above question, he wondered if there'd be a way for the salesman to approve the invoice and then have an alert auto-sent back to the office staff to let them know that they can send it.
    * I told him that we could explore this during the design.



  


I am currently waiting to hear back from Matthias / Audra on Matthias' availability to do this HLD.

  


Ben Reitz 09/10/2024: I went ahead and created the HLD incident: [[[IN10562](https://zch.apphosting.zone/Detail/Edit/2?RecordType=Incidents&NumberID=-10564&)]] - Gem Wood - HLD (for time tracking)

  


And the proposal: [https://zch.apphosting.zone/Detail/Edit/2?RecordType=ClientProposals&NumberID=-91&StateID=CmW8uPt2rdS1&ShowTitleBar=true&State=ISwSvCyE0ts&#](https://zch.apphosting.zone/Detail/Edit/2?RecordType=ClientProposals&NumberID=-91&StateID=CmW8uPt2rdS1&ShowTitleBar=true&State=ISwSvCyE0ts&#)
