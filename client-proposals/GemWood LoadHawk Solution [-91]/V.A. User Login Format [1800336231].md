5.1. User Login Format

The Solution uses the username/password login format. 

  


The login credentials are set on the User Profile. These are standard features. 

  


Password requirements: 

  * Minimum of 6 characters 
  * At least 1 capital letter, 1 number, and 1 special character ("Alpha, Numeric, Symbol"). 



  


Other Notes: 

  * Note that an email address is required by the database for all User Logins, even if the user is not using the Quick Login format. If a user does not have an email address, one workaround is to enter a Gmail or Gmail-hosted email address and simply add "+" and the user's name before the "@" symbol. CCI can provide more information on this process.
