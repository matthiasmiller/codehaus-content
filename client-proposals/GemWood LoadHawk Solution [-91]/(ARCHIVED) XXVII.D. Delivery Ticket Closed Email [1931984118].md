27.4. Delivery Ticket Closed Email

  


Requirements

Sean Miller 04/29/2025: Moved to [[[IN11421](https://zch.apphosting.zone/Detail/Edit/2?RecordType=Incidents&NumberID=-11423&)]] - ZGW - Delivery Ticket Closed Email

  


  


A feature was included in the initial Phase 1 spec to send an email to the Member when a Delivery Ticket is closed. This is being deferred to reduce scope and cost, and could be brought back at a later point. 

  


Estimated Cost: $1,500 

  


Spec: This includes the following items: 

  


Item 1. Silverloom Settings page: 

  * Silverloom Settings | Email Settings section:
    * Default Text for Delivery Ticket Closed Email (memo that can include expressions; defaults to blank; the contents of this memo are used as the template for the "Delivery Ticket Closed Email"; warning on Save if blank; sample text is as follows:) 



Hello, 

  


This delivery ticket has been closed by GemWood. Please see the attached document for details. 

  


Thank you! 

  


  


Item 2. Contact Record | Member Details section:

  


  * Manually forward web link attachments (checkbox; defaults to not checked; if checked, the "Delivery Ticket Closed Email" is sent to the internal GemWood email address specified in SMTP settings (probably [gemwood@timberdriven.com](mailto:gemwood@timberdriven.com)), for GemWood to manually download and attach the Buyer Grade Report file(s) and forward the email on to the Member; this is mainly for Members who don't have internet access) 



  


  


Item 3. Delivery Ticket record | Documentation Section:

  


  * Add'l Notes for Ticket Closed Email (button; opens a child screen with an editable memo that can be edited by the user to add custom text to bottom of the standard email body on a per-Ticket basis) 
  * Send Delivery Ticket Closed Email (visible after the initial save for the record; link; prompts the user to save the current record, then opens a preview of the email in a new tab, with a button to send the email)



  


  


Item 4. Email template/merge:

Overview: This email merge is used to notify a Member that a Delivery Ticket has been marked as "Closed". It is sent from a Delivery Ticket when a user clicks the "Send Delivery Ticket Closed Email" link

  


From: The email address specified in SMTP settings (probably [gemwood@timberdriven.com](mailto:gemwood@timberdriven.com))

  * Note that the email body (see the corresponding spec) also includes links for the following:
