1.6. Member Payments Overview

The Member Payment record tracks details about an outgoing payment to a Member. The general overview is as follows: 

  


  * There are two main approaches to Member Payment Terms:


  * If the Member Payment Terms for the Ticket include an optional Early Pay Discount, GemWood may send a payment for the full estimated ticket total, minus the Early Pay Discount and the GemWood Fee. After the Buyer settlement, the numbers are recalculated (with the exception of the Early Pay Discount) and any balance is due to the Member within 3 days of the Buyer settlement. If GemWood chooses to not pay early, the full amount, minus the GemWood Fee, is due within 3 days of the Buyer settlement.
  * Otherwise, the full amount, minus the GemWood Fee, is due within 3 days of the Buyer settlement.


  * When GemWood is ready to make a payment to a Member, the user opens a new Member Payment record for the desired Delivery Ticket. Most of the details for the Delivery Ticket are automatically filled in on the record. The user can then apply overpayments from other Delivery Tickets for the same Member, which reduces the amount due to the Member for the current payment.
  * Upon saving the new Member Payment record, it is marked as "Complete". However, the user can change the Payment record status if changes are needed.
