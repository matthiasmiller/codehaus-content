13.1. Data Migration

The process of importing data and cleaning up migrated data during deployment will be done by GemWood with guidance and assistance from CCI as needed. 

  


The following data will be migrated into the Solution: 

  * Member-type Contacts: approx. 12 
  * Buyer-type Contacts: approx. 45 
  * Internal-type Contacts: approx. 5 



  


Since there are not many Contacts to migrate in, the migration may be done manually or via the standard Contacts import + manual configuration. If via the import, CCI will provide the input format for migrating data into the Solution.

  


This proposal includes 3 hours of data migration time by CCI. Additional time may be billed on a per-hour / T&M basis.

  


Other Notes: 

  * Per email conversation between Tim & Dane on 4/15/2025, GemWood is planning to only do the basic Contacts migration, as part of deployment/setup.
