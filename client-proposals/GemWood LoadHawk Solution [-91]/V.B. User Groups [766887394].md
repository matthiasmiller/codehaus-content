5.2. User Groups

The Solution will use various User Groups to determine permissions for different users. Each user should be assigned to a User Group. Note that the User Group (used for User Profiles / user logins) is distinct from the Contact Type (used for Contact records).

  


User Groups are manually configured in the Solution. This can be done with assistance from CCI as needed.

  


The following are the User Groups used in the GemWood Solution. Note that the data access details included here are generalizations (see the Permissions section of this proposal for the full details). 

  


  * "Full Access" User Group (this is used by only a few users, such as CCI support and Dane; users in this Group have full view & edit access to the entire database)
    * Account Type: "Administrator" 
  * "Data Entry" User Group (this is used by standard users; users in this Group have have ability to view most data in the database, and edit some) 
    * Account Type: "User"
  * "Salespeople" User Group (users in this Group can view most data, but are very limited in what they can edit; the Salesperson would be included in this category) 
    * Account Type: "User"



  


Other Notes: 

  * Additional User Groups, such as "Member Users" could be added at some point in the future.
