25.3. Payment Statuses List

*Done. 

  


This is a non-editable simple list used to track the status of Payment records, for both Buyer and Member Payments. It includes the following items: 

  


  * Open 
  * Closed
  * Canceled



  


This list is universal for all users.

  


Note that this sequence is static, so it should always be displayed in this sequence throughout the Solution.

  


This list will be set up by CCI as part of the main development. If changes need to be made to this list, it will require some coding work.

  


Ellis Miller 12/16/2024: _VA: We are going to add a generic OpenClosedCanceled list to Silverloom Base that will be available for all systems. You can remove this from here.

Tim Reitz 12/17/2024: Marking this section as inactive.
