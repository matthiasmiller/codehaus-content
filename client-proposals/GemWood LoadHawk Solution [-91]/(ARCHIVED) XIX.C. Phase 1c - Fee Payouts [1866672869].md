19.3. Phase 1c - Fee Payouts

_VA: 

Tim Reitz 10/10/2024: All of the below items have been incorporated into the proposal spec. 

Let's archive this section at some point (or incorporate into a Phase 1 Overview). 

  


_VA: Tim Reitz 10/10/2024: For reporting, expenses should go one of the 4 "Role" groups (for taxes, they are going to owners, but for reporting they want to designate the group).

_VA: Tim Reitz 10/10/2024: Any contact in one of those 4 groups can receive Fee Payouts (not just owners).

_VA: Tim Reitz 10/10/2024: One group per person.
