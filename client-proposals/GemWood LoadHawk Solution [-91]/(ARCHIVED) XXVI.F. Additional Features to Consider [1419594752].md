26.6. Additional Features to Consider

Sean Miller 04/30/2025: Moved to [[[IN11444](https://zch.apphosting.zone/Detail/Edit/2?RecordType=Incidents&NumberID=-11446&)]] - ZGW - Additional Features to Consider

  


  


Additional future items that can be considered include: 

  


  * Notification to alert users of Delivery Tickets that should be closed. This would require consideration to determine what logic should be used to flag Tickets needing closing. 
  * NACHA Exports for member payments, commissions, and internal fee payouts. This will streamline the ACH process with the bank.
  * Detect Favored Buyers / Members 


  * This would include reporting to help determine if certain Buyers are being sourced by certain Member(s) more than others. 


  * Full Accounting integration 


  * This could be with QuickBooks or with the Silverloom Accounting Module. 


  * Freight bill and payment tracking


  * Could be a new record ("Freight Bill") and corresponding Type for Payment records.
