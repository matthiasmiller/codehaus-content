19\. HLD Pricing Estimate

  


Requirements

CodeCrafters has reviewed the high-level design that we put together for your software solution. Keep in mind that the final quoted price would come after the completion of an In-Depth Design, and could be higher or lower than this, or somewhere around what we're thinking now, depending on how all the details work out. Based on the information we gathered in the high-level design, we are anticipating this to be in the $55K-85K range for development and deployment of Phase 1 of this solution.  

  


Also, as with building a house or buying a vehicle, there are ongoing maintenance expenses to make sure the software keeps working well for the long haul. When we build a software solution, we provide ongoing support and maintenance that includes the following:

  * System hosting
  * Regular backups
  * Monitoring
  * Unlimited U.S.-based phone support
  * Up-to-date system documentation
  * Security updates and bug fixes
  * Enhancements to the Silverloom platform
  * Design for minor system change requests



  


Industry standards show that software maintenance typically has an annual cost of about 10-25% of the original investment. We would expect your annual maintenance expenses to be in the 10-15% range (probably $7K-12K per year based on our current ballpark estimate).

  


If any of this looks higher than what your budget would allow, we could potentially reduce cost and scope in one or more ways, such as starting out with only a few features and adding others as time goes on, or simplifying various parts of the solution. We're committed to giving you high value with whatever you move forward with, and we'd be glad to discuss this with you on a call if you have any questions.

  


If you decide to move forward with the In-Depth Design and then to move forward with development of the full project, we plan to break it into phases for in-depth design and coding (but it could still be deployed all together when complete). 

  


We would like to invite you to enter the In-Depth Design phase if you would like to continue the process. The price for the In-Depth Design including all mockups and wireframes would be $10,500.

  


Pricing Breakdown

High-Level Design (HLD)| $3,500| Already paid  
---|---|---  
In-Depth Design (IDD)| $10,500| Due at the commencement of the IDD process, If you wish to start soon, it could all be paid at once. If you wish to wait a few weeks or months, we could invoice you for 1/2 to save you a place in the design pipeline, with the other 1/2 due when design starts.  
Anticipated build-out cost| $55,000-85,000| To be refined and finalized at the conclusion of the IDD. Generally includes coding, extensive QA testing, and deployment; likely divided as follows in the next 3 rows.  
Due to start coding| 40% of final cost|   
  
Due to start testing| 40% of final cost|   
  
Due on deployment| 20% (remainder) of final cost|   
  
Ongoing maintenance| TBD| Generally 10-15% of the final development cost (anticipated at $7K-12K if paid annually; $700-1,200 per month if paid monthly)
