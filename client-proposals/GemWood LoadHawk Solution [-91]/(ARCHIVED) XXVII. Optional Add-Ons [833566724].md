27\. Optional Add-Ons

The following items are included as optional add-ons that could be done as part of Phase 1, or at a later date. These are more complex features that improve automation and/or usability for the more basic features that are included in the main spec above. 

  


The prices noted for these individual add-on items are in addition to the price for the main Phase 1 Solution and would be accepted separately unless specifically added back into the main proposal.

  


Also, the estimated cost noted for each one is approximate, and may change if features are added at a later date as change requests (compared to including them in Phase 1). As such, each would need individual review and possibly updated design & pricing when considered as change requests.
