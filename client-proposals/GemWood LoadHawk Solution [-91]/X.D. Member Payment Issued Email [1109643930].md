TODO_PRICING: Tim Reitz 12/10/2024: Emails were not included in the HLD, but at the start of the IDD the client had mentioned wanting to handle pay remittance, which seems like it would include communicating with the Members about payments.

  


Ellis Miller 12/24/2024: NOTE: We will need a draft of this email before implementation so that we can set up macros for it.
