6.4. Workflows

There will be two separate workflows for setting up Devices:

  


  * Managed:
    * Set up the Device record via the Home | Devices | New Managed Device menu option
    * Add the Device to an existing Manage Service Agreement or set up a new Managed Service Agreement and add the Device to it
    * Create the $0 invoice for the printer (but doesn't necessarily get sent to the customer)
    * Invoice the customer for the first billing cycle
  * Customer-Owned:
    * Invoice the customer for the printer
    * If desired, set up the Device record via the Home | Devices | New Customer Printer menu option
