6.10.2.5. Recently Revised Agreements Report

  


Requirements

This is a report of Agreement records that have had a revision made to them in the past 30 days and have not had the Updated Agreement Notice Email sent since the revision was made.

TODO_EM: Tim Reitz 10/03/2023: Good with this? Or should we simplify it to have a "Needs Review" checkbox on the Agreement like the Device, and base this report (and the report alert) on that?
