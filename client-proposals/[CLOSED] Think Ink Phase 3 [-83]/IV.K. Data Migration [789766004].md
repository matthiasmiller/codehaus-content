4.11. Data Migration

Data Migration: The process of importing and cleaning up migrated data will be done by Think Ink with guidance and assistance from CCI/CH. CodeCrafters will provide the import and input format for migrating the existing database. Think Ink will provide the Excel import file.

  


The following data will be migrated into the Solution: 

  


  * Sales Items (coming from Classic Accounting) 
    * 


  


  * Devices (coming from Think Ink's database):
    * 


TODO_JM / TODO_IDD: Ben Reitz 10/03/2023: think through all of the fields that need to be imported and how to set them

  


  * Page Count Details (coming from Think Ink's database):
    * 


TODO_EM: Tim Reitz 07/27/2023: Client has some data on this. Thoughts from our side on whether we should do this? 

  


TODO_IDD: Tim Reitz 07/27/2023: Put together a template for each of these for Jesse to put together the import file.

  


Other Notes: 

  


This proposal includes __ hours of data migration time by CCI/CH. Additional time may be billed on a per-hour/T&M basis.
