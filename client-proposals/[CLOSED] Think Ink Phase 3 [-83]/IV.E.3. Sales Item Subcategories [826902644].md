4.5.3. Sales Item Subcategories

TODO_JM: Tim Reitz 09/21/2023: Is this the same as the 'Type' on the pricing spreadsheet that you showed us? 

  


This is a user-editable simple list used to track Sales Item Subcategories. 

  


Example list items may include: 

  * HP supply item 
  * Canon supply item
  * Business Printer
  * Home Printer
  * etc.



  


This list is universal for all users, and all users can add to it via the "+" option on the drop list on the Sales Item record. 

  


The initial items for this list are to be set up by Think Ink, with assistance from CCI/CH as needed.
