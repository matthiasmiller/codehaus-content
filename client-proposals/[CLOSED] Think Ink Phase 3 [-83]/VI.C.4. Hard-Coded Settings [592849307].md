Billing Dates: Hard-coded to be the 1st and 3rd Tuesday of each month

Rounding Decimals: 

  * When calculating Page Count Overage charges for "separate" Agreements: Calculate the amount for each Device without rounding, then round each Device's amount to the nearest 2 decimal places, then calculate the total for all Devices. 
  * When calculating Page Count Overage charges for "combined" Agreements: Calculate the total for the Agreement without rounding, then round the total to the nearest 2 decimal places.
