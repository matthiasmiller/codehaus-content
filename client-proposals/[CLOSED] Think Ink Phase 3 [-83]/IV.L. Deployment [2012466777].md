4.12. Deployment

Deployment: CodeCrafters/CodeHaus will provide support and training for users, especially the admins, throughout the deployment of the software. This may include Zoom calls, recorded video walkthroughs, phone calls, emails, technical support, in-person work, etc. 

  


This proposal assumes a total of up to __ hours of deployment support & training time. Additional time beyond that may be billed on a per-hour/T&M basis. 

  


Admin users may be given access to the dedicated test system prior to/during deployment to allow for practicing and learning the system. 

  


The following items are to be configured by CCI/CH at deployment (see corresponding sections of the proposal for additional details): 

  * TODO_IDD
  *  
  * Device Tags
  * etc
