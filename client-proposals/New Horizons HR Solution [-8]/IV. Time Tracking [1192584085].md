4\. Time Tracking

  


Requirements

We will start tracking time in this solution, proving time clock appliances for each of the thrift stores.

  


We will provide reports to quickly and easily generate the numbers required to run payroll in Quickbooks.

  


Development Specification

  * Should we switch the time clocks in the store to this system?
    * See [https://www.lathem.com/payclock-online/plans-prices](https://www.lathem.com/payclock-online/plans-prices)
    * Otherwise, how will they know to pay for vacation hours?
    * We probably show a summary of paid time off on the time card.
    * Do you translate time off the hours paid on the payroll?



  


Latest iteration per Josh -- vacation request records, then gets copied over to the RG as days.

  * Have the policies by automatic, but they are not full enforced
