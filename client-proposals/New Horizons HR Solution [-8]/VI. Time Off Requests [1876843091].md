6\. Time Off Requests

  


Requirements

We will need to track vacation requests. These will require manager approval.

  


If the user enters the request after the deadline, we will show a notice in red indicating that its past the normal deadline.

  


USER SPECIFICATION

Time Off Requests will specify:

  * Vacation dates
  * Additional fields, such as purpose of travel, etc
  * Manager approval



  


Once the dates are selected, the vacation requests will show a list of days, an associated policy, and the available allowance for each day and policy. However, individuals can revamp this.

  


We will not default the policy, since the Scheduled Day Off will vary from person to person. We will require them to select the policy.

  


Overages will show a negative "number of days" in red.
