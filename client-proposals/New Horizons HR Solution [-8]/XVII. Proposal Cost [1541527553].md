17\. Proposal Cost

The full cost to design, build, and deploy the custom application as described above is $20,500.

  


As promised in our original design agreement, you may apply $750 of the design cost towards this development if this proposal is accepted within 45 days. You may apply an additional $300 discount if the initial development is paid by check.

  


We typically charge 2% monthly subscription fee for a standard software subscription. Because of our relationship with New Horizons, we are offering you this subscription at our hosting costs. This contract includes support and fixes for this solution for the first 90 days.

  


We expect many of your requests to fall within the scope of this proposal. Requests that do not fall within this scope will be handled on a case-by-case basis and may require additional payment.

  


We have also provided a customized monthly plan, allowing you to significantly reduce the monthly cost of this solution.
