Magazine Export

This would be a Word Export. It should be 12pt Times New Roman.

  


It would first export all the B church schedules. The heading for the B churches should read: "(B) Church services were May 17, will be May 31, Lord willing". The first date should be 10 days prior to the publication date, and the second date should be 4 days after publication date. (Note that these will always be a Sunday.)

  


It should then export all the A church schedules. The heading should be the same, except the first date should be 3 days prior to the publication date, and the second date should be 11 days after the publication date. (Note that these will always be a Sunday.)

  


Within each, all churches will be ordered by number and letter and formatted like this:

  


Church # - Church Name Church: Last Church

Next: Next Church

VM: Visiting Minister

Others: Visitors

Notes

  


If the church does not have a report, it should be formatted like this (without the Church suffix):

  


Church # - Church Name

Missing Report

  


After that, add a heading for each type of entry (except Church, which is covered above), with an export of all the entries of that type. If they are associated with a church, they should be sort by Church #. Otherwise, they should be sorted in the order they were received.

  


Missed Reports

We want to be able to generate a report for missed reports. Prompt for publication date. Show a list of all churches that have not submitted a Church entry for that publication date.

  


Entries Needing Followup

This shows all entries needing a followup, grouped (and reverse sorted) by Publication Date.
