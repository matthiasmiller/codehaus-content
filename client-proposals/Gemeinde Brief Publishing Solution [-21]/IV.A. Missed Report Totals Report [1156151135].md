4.1. Missed Report Totals Report

Add a new report to the ZPP Gemeinde Brief solution: 

  


This is a report showing the amount of reports that churches are missing for a selected range of publication dates. This is similar to the Missed Reports report, but it shows one row for each active church in the system, with a column for the total number of missed reports in the selected date range.

  


This would be accessed from a "Missed Report Totals" menu option in the Magazine Entries section of the Gemeinde Brief menu.
