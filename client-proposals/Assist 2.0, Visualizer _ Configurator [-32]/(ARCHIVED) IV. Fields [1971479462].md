Questions

Interior Lights 

  * how are they placed? Matthias Miller 02/10/2021: Visualizer goes to the ceiling...needs to snap to where the trusses are, ideally that's less of an issue on placement because you can screw it to the bottom of the truss, or you can out it about anywhere in the building -- but on first reaction, it should go into the center of building
  * how do they affect interior walls? Matthias Miller 02/10/2021: Answered...



On porches:

  * There's a line that you can't cross -- is that the same for others?
  * Presumably you can't have a porch on both ends? Matthias Miller 02/10/2021: Theoretically...but not practically--let's ignore that for now...
  * Can we treat the small window in the top as a variable of the vent -- property on the option -- can I fit in the top, and is there a building width minimum? Which goes more broadly to the issue of what buildings options are available for...
  * Use an invisible option that's always at a specific height...always at the sidewall height...
  * Can we treat the top



  


New Questions

[ ] Can we rely on window/door margins, or is there a maximum number of doors/windows we can have on a given side?

Per Duane, yes, as long as it's configured correctly.

Margins can be collapsed from one option to another. For example, two windows side-by-side need to have a 3" margin NOT a total of 6"

  


  * Each type of building would have a standard configuration.
  * 70% will just take whatever is there, and just change the colors (using some kind of preconfigured setup). The power of suggestion has a lot of sway when they have no idea what they're talking about.
  * What are some the crazy ones? For example 4 doors/windows ot turn them into cubicles.



  


[ ] Can we categorize doors as Single Doors vs Double Doors?

  * Do people think of this differently? Or are these basically one category?
  * Larger size conversation is relationship between singe/double/overhead...Duane doesn't have the answer.



  


[ ] Does the default door/window need to change based on the shed type/size?

  * Pick defaults based on what's already in the shed (if they have two kinds of windows)



  


[ ] When does the user pick what? For eample, customizing single vs double door?

  * See above



  


[ ] How often do people pick the defaults, or change it? How about by themselves vs. at the dealer site?

  * See above



  


[ ] How to handle tall doors?

  * If it doesn't fit, you should maybe prompt the wall height rather than doing it automatically?
  * For the designer, it may be nice to have a warning on things that don't fit when you are rearranging it?
  * You may want to prompt about the taller height wall?



  


[ ] We are planning to have two separate types for light switches (Switch for Interior Lights, Switch for Externior Lights)

  * All interior lights can be on the same one
  * Exterior lights require one, but can be on different ones
  * Could we have a NOTES option on each item?
  * Do we need to automatically move lightswitches when you move a door?



  


[ ] For pegboards, should we allow certain items to be placed within it? I.e. light switches or outlets  (OR it could NEVER collide with anything)

  * Sounds right.
  * Keep in mind outlets can go below workbenches as well.
  * Keep in mind that external outlets should not be obscured by siding.



  


[ ] How do kid-sized porch swings work? Are they hung from the ceiling? Can you control where they are positioned? (Are they a ceiling-add-on with a certain margin on all sides?

  * Probably hung from the ceiling
  * Sent email -- Duane will follow-up.



  


[ ] Can you have a porch light on porches? If so, is there an exterior options?

  * Both on the wall and the ceiling
  * You can have it on exterior walls as well, as well as gables in the roof
  * You may want to have suggestions -- it should snap to a suggested spot.
  * NOTE -- you'll need to control doorswing, and denote it on the floorplan.



  


[ ] For the workbenches, pegboard, and shelves....can we just have a min width, plus an increment amount (2ft)?

  * Pegboard would come down to the workbench and work as a backsplash
  * 8/10/12 is lenght
  * Workbench is typically 36", and so this probably starts at 36"
  * Could be minimum/recommended height off the floor'Could have a recommended height but not required height?



  


[ ] Where do breaker boxes go?

  * Reasonable places -- most of the times where he's seen them, a building that has an endwall door, that's the FRONT of the building, breaker boxes gon on the back-right.
  * If you come in from a sidewall, it's a back-right side.
  * The breaker-box should maybe an unvisualized option, and if you need it in a partiuclar spot, contact the sales dept...
  * How often does the customer go on the website, configure the thing, and have it sent to their door? Current sheds direct does not have any pricing that is part of it.



  


Broader philosophy

  * Would be nice to let the customer pay, then have someone call 



  


[ ] AC unit is a cutout in the wall? Does it require an outlet?

  * Mounted into the wall, and generally they do them underneath indows.
  * Per Duane needs an outlet.
  * Outlet is placed right beside the unit, and if you want something different, call the builder. *Internally would work like shuttesr, etc*



  


[ ] Do you need to place the button for the overhead door opener?

  * If you have an overhead door with an automatic opener, you should warn if you don't have any other doors.
  * Automatically place opener beside other entry door.



  


[ ] Can ridge-vent ever be a partial length of building or is it the full length?

  * Can be partial length -- or per Duane SHOULD allow partial length



  


[ ] Do partition walls need a door in them?

  * Need movable door -- unless they're doing a partial partition wall
  * Could we have this an option for this, but require them to call into sales? And then show a price of $5K+custom options.



  


Garage doors will need a taller bulding and heavier floors.

  


  


Tiny Home Notes:

* Probably will need to restrict where things go

  


  


[ ] Need to be able to configure where it snaps to.

  


  


NOTES

\- Porches will shorten the base.

  


  


  


  


\- Some will only be available

  


\- The margin

\- Nothing can be put on top of each other, except for vents in the gable end...but vents can't be moved

\- Windows on top of doors? Will want to do that option, where some of the new styles will have that...

\- Second margin for windows, above the doors/windows...

  


  


\- Side wall heights need to be able to be different from left and right side

\- Lofts

\- Work bench - end wall, side wall, halfway along...

  


-SmartBuild

-Window + FlowerBox + Shutter -- prices should be variable based on size, should be sized basedd on window

-Garage door should add center joist

  


\- For adding to the garage door, give options for insulation, style, windows, etc for the garage doors

\- Porch needs to restrict frrom being able to put a garage door on that end

\- The height of a porch wall is going to be lower than the height than a regular end wall, so it's possible you can make the dimenstions right to prevent garage doors

\- The porch shortens the length of the building.

\- This needs to update the SQFT price of the floor

  


\- Baseboard heat in cottages -- needs a 220 breaker box -

\- AC in regular buildings 

  


Constraint to walls

\- Interior Wall options (LF)

\- Interior Door options

\- Interior wall can probably be put wherever

\- You don't want a loft at 8ft, with a wall at 10ft

  


\- Pegboard -
