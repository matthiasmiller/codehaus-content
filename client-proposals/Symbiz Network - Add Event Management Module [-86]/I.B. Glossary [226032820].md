1.2. Glossary

  


Requirements

*Documented 

  


Overview: The purpose of this glossary is to provide a description of key terms, roles, and other things referred to in this proposal. These are listed in alphabetical order below: 

  


  * Annual Summit: An annual network-wide gathering for Symbiz members and interested individuals. This is a day-long event with various speakers, workshops, and networking opportunities. The main even is preceded by a "Meet & Greet" networking time that occurs the evening before the event. 
  * "Event": The umbrella term used in this proposal for one of various types of events that Symbiz facilitates, and also for the record type used to track these events.
  * Industry Forum: An event put together by Symbiz for members of one or more specific industries, with industry-specific content and networking.
  * Info Meeting: An event put together by Symbiz to inform interested individuals of the Symbiz Network. This is a large factor in generating new members. Everyone who registers for that meeting is entered as a Lead-type Contact and then added to the Attendance table on the Info Meeting record. After the meeting, a Symbiz team member should follow up with everyone who attended. 
  * KPI: A "key performance indicator", a metric used to track and measure a data point in the Solution. 
  * Launch Meeting: This is a meeting that is scheduled after an Info Meeting, with the purpose of organizing one or more new Growth Ring Groups from leads that attended the Info Meeting. Note that there is only one Launch Meeting per Info Meeting, but multiple Groups may be formed out of the Launch Meeting.
  * Registrant: A Contact (either member or non-member) who has a registration for an Event.
