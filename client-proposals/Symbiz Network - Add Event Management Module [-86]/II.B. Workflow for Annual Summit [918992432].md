Development Specification

_VA: Tim Reitz 05/21/2024: Let's put together a basic workflow for this. 

Ellis Miller 06/20/2024: Shouldn't we depend on the client for these workflows? Except perhaps the specific pieces intersecting with our software. It could take significant time from us that we need to bill them for.
