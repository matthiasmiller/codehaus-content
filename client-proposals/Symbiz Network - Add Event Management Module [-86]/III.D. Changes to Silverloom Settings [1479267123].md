3.4. Changes to Silverloom Settings

  


Requirements

*Documented 

  


Make the following changes to the Silverloom Settings page (changes indicated with blue / strike-through): 

  


Registration Settings section:

  * Default Registration Coordinator (drop list of all Contacts; the Contact selected here is the default selection for the Registration Coordinator on all Events; defaults to blank; warning on Save if blank: "Default Registration Coordinator is blank.")



  


Note that as part of setup after the changes are deployed to the system (both test and live system), a Contact record with a name such as "Main Office" should be set up, with a phone number and/or email address. In the test system, this is to be done by the tester. In the live system, this is to be done by Symbiz.

  


Development Specification

Tim Reitz 06/03/2024: NOTE: When you code this portion, please note in the TI for the tester to set up a Contact with a name such as "Main Office" to set as the Default Registration Coordinator.
