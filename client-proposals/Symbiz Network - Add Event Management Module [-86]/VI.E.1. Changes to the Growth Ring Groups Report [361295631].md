6.5.1. Changes to the Growth Ring Groups Report

*Documented 

  


Add the following filter to the existing Growth Ring Groups Report (in blue): 

  


Filters (all apply directly to the left pane): 

  * Group Description (drop list of Group Descriptions; filters down as you type; defaults to blank = all)
  * Facilitator (drop list of all Facilitators; defaults to blank = all)
  * Facilitator State/Province (drop list of all States/Provinces; defaults to blank = all) 
  * Region (drop list of all Regions; defaults to blank = all) 
  * Regional Rep (drop list of all Regional Reps; defaults to blank = all)
  * Info Meeting (drop list of Event IDs for all non-canceled Info Meeting-type Events; defaults to blank = all) 
  * Group Type (drop list of Group Type items; defaults to blank = all)
  * Active/Inactive (visible only for Regional Reps & Super Admin; drop list of Active / Inactive / All; defaults to Active)



  


Note that a possible future change would be to add an "Info Meeting" column, displaying the Event ID.
