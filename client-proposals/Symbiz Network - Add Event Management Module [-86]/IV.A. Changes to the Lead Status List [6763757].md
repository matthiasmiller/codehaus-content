This is a non-editable simple list used to track the status or progression of a lead. It includes the following items: 

  


  * Initial Contact Conversation
  * Info Meeting Process Info Meeting or Target Group
  * Meeting Invite Sent (note: merge this item into the new Info Meeting Process item)
  * Info Meeting Follow-Up Post-Info Meeting Followup
  * Application Received 
  * Future Cultivation 
  * Inactive Lead



  


This list is universal for all users.

  


Note that this sequence is static, so it should always be displayed in this sequence throughout the Solution.

  


This list will be set up by CCI as part of the main development. If changes need to be made to this list, it will require some coding work.
