5.2. Organization Types

This is a user-editable simple list used to track Organization Types. 

  


Example list items may include: 

  * School
  * Nonprofit
  * Business



  


This list is universal for all users, and all Admin users can add to it via the "+" option on the drop list on the Organization record. 

  


The initial items for this list are to be set up by FB, with assistance from CCI/CH as needed.
