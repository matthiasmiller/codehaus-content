Included in email: 

  


[X] 1\. On a scale of 1 to 10, how important is it to access the software from a mobile device, such as a phone or tablet? Maybe a 6. 5 means completely neutral. A 6 means we would have a slight preference for this capability.

  


[X] 2\. Do you want to import data from an existing software system or spreadsheets? If yes, what data (i.e. contacts, sales items, invoices, etc.)? We will need to download the book scans. I can’t think of anything else at this point. We may want to export contact data to our central database.

  


[X] 3\. We offer two options for login format: A quick login using Gmail/Google accounts, and a username/password login. It can also be set up so that some users use one and others use the other. Which format would you prefer? We prefer the username/pw login.

_HLD: could also consider a sign in link. Need more info from Matthias on this.

_HLD: participants should be able to sign up and buy a track without involvement from FB.
