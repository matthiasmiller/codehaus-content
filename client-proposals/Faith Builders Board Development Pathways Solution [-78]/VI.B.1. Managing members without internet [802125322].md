6.2.1. Managing members without internet

The Solution will provide features for managing Organizations and Participants that do not use internet.

  


Account and Pathway Management: Some Board Reps don't have internet access or might want FB to manage it for them. In these cases, the account is labeled as "FB Managed" and FB personnel will manage the account for them (adding Subscriptions, making payments, adding/removing participants, changing the Board Rep, etc.). 

  


Lessons: Some or all Participants in an Organization may be without internet. In these cases, there are two options for them to receive their Lessons: fax and postal mail (see the "Communications Formats" sections of the proposal). 

  


Format for Lessons that are sent via Mail:

  * Cover page with the Participant's name, address, and the email body
  * Additional pages for the attachments



  


Format for Lessons that include video links:

  * FB would generate a transcript from the video when setting up the Pathway
  * The transcript will be added as a PDF file to the Lesson
  * Both the PDF and the video link will be sent to everyone
