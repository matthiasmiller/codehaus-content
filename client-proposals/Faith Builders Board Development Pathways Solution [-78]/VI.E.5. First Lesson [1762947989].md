6.5.5. First Lesson

Initial introduction & first lesson: 

  


Hello <Participant FirstName>,

  


With this email, you are receiving the <corresponding ordinal number> of <total # of lessons in Pathway> board member development lessons. Around the first of each month, another lesson will appear in your inbox. The lessons will include book chapters, stand-alone articles, and video clips that should take 10-20 minutes to read or watch. There will be lessons on best board practices, fundraising, setting policy, evaluating organizational mission, and governance. We welcome any ideas for improving the value of these lessons.

  


Many of the lessons will contain copyrighted material. Our licensing only extends to you so please do not forward these lessons.

  


One way to maximize the value of this project is for each board member to write a one sentence takeaway after reading (or watching) the lesson and send it to the rest of the board. An easy way to do this would be to reply all to the original lesson email.
