5.1. Pathway Tags

This is a user-editable simple list used to track Pathway Tags. These tags are used to sort, filter, and identify themes in the Pathways. 

  


Example list items may include: 

  * Fundraising 
  * Board Roles 
  * Meetings
  * Finances



  


This list is universal for all users, and all Admin users can add to it via the "+" option on the drop list on the Pathway record. 

  


The initial items for this list are to be set up by FB, with assistance from CCI/CH as needed.
