8.3. Print / Postal Mail

  


Requirements

As mentioned elsewhere, communications generated as print will include a cover page with the recipient's name and address, located to display in a #10 windowed envelope. Template and details to be determined in IDD.

  


FB will probably start by sending out paper copies manually. As demand grows, we will look into using a service such as ClickSend or "email-to-mail". 

  


For manual mailings, the printouts would include the mailing address of the participant located to display in a #10 window envelope.
