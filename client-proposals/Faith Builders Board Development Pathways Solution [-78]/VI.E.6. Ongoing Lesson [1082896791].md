6.5.6. Ongoing Lesson

Second and following: 

  


Hello <Participant FirstName>,

  


With this email, you are receiving the <corresponding ordinal number> of <total # of lessons in Pathway> board member development lessons. We welcome any ideas for improving the value of these lessons.

  


<Additional Email Text for the Lesson> 

  


One way to maximize the value of this project is for each board member to write a one sentence takeaway after reading (or watching) the lesson and send it to the rest of the board. An easy way to do this would be to reply all to the original lesson email.
