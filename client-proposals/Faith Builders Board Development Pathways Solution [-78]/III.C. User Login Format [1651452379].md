3.3. User Login Format

  


Requirements

Faith Builders personnel will access the AppHosting Solution via a username and password.

  


Board Representatives will access via username and password or a special sign in link. They should be able to sign up and buy a Pathway without involvement from FB.

  


Development Specification

We offer two options for login format: A quick login using Gmail/Google accounts, and a username/password login. It can also be set up so that some users use one and others use the other. Which format would you prefer? We prefer the username/pw login.

TODO_IDD: sign-in link idea. Need more info from Matthias on this.
