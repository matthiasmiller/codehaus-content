1\. Overview

  


Requirements

Faith Builders Resource Group is an organization dedicated to giving development tools to nonprofit (and in the future, school) boards. One of the resources they offer is the Board Development Pathways program. These "Pathways" contain monthly lessons that currently span a 2-year timeframe, but could also be shorter or longer. Pathways are purchased for a non-refundable, upfront cost and then can be started whenever the purchasing board desires. The Lessons in a Pathway are distributed monthly to each board member via email, but this Solution includes options for fax and mail as well. At the completion of a Pathway, the physical books that were studied will be sent to the Board Rep to be distributed to the participants.

  


The purpose of this software solution is to provide a platform for Organizations to sign up for and track their progression in a Pathway. The solution also provides a more streamlined way for Faith Builders to provide these Pathways to the Organizations.

  


The workflow looks generally like this: 

  


  * Board Representative browses the website
    * (This likely would be set up the FB marketing team.) 
  * Website includes an option to sign up online or call in to FB to sign up
  * Clicking the button to Sign Up / Sign In would open the front page for the Solution integration
  * Create account (requires information such as:) 
    * First Name
    * Last Name
    * Email
    * Name of board/organization
    * Type of board (non-profit, business, school, etc.)
  * Log in
  * View list of Pathway options with option to drill in to view the details / descriptions (length, pricing, lessons, etc)
  * Select a Pathway
  * List of information that needed to sign up the participants (maybe even a PDF printout to fill out by hand)
  * Select preferences:
    * Starting month
    * Starting week
    * Email/fax send day (first Monday, second Saturday, etc.)
    * Email/fax send time (morning, afternoon, evening)
  * Enter information for each participant (or this might be part of the account setup after logging in):
    * First Name
    * Last Name
    * Method of Delivery (Email, Fax, Mail)
    * Email
    * Fax
    * Mailing Address
  * Order overview page
    * Pathway
    * Preferences
    * Number of participants
    * $ total
  * Payment page (pay upfront for full Pathway)
  * Confirmation email is sent to the Board Representative (includes information such as:)

    * Welcome is being sent to all participants; make sure that they give you confirmation. 
    * Separate email has been sent with with receipt

    * Total price 
  * Welcome letter is sent to all participants (via their preferred receipt format)
    * Your board representative has signed up your board for a Pathway with ___, due to start (date)... please confirm with your Board Representative.."
  * Lessons start going out on the start date.
  * (For Email participants only) Option to reply all to the email to send comments/take-aways to the other board members.
    * It would be nice to maintain a record in the database of who has replied, so that the Board Representative can see who has replied.
  * When the board completes the Pathway, a wrap-up / congratulations communication is sent out to all participants who complete it (with list of other Pathway options that they can choose from if they wish to continue).
  * Board Representative gets a follow-up email (includes information such as:) 
    * Thanks
    * Opportunity to give feedback
    * Etc.



  


Note: We would add documentation on workflows and how to use the software in the In-Depth Design.
