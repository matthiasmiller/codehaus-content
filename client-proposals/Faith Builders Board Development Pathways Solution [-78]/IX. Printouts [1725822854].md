9\. Printouts

The Solution generates various printouts.

  


Basic printouts can be generated from the Advanced menu of a report. Note that the PDF versions of such printouts can be branded with a Faith Builders logo and contact information but do not have any additional special customizations. Basic Excel files do not include the logo/branding.

  


Customized printouts are provided for various reports and/or records. CodeCrafters will take some liberty with the design of these printouts to simplify development and to compensate for technical limitations. Customized PDFs include an Faith Builders letterhead, and customized Excel printout/files can include the logo.
