15.1. Resource Record

_HLD: Tim Reitz 07/28/2023: Should this be a subsection of the Track, or should we have a separate record for resources (like ZSB)? 

_SB: what information does the solution need to track for resources / licensing separate from the course/lessons themselves? 

Tim Reitz 08/14/2023: Asking in email today. 

_HLD: Ben Reitz 08/14/2023: From client: None.

  


_SB: would you use the same resource for multiple different Pathways, or always 1-to-1?

_HLD: Tim Reitz 08/15/2023: No, not at this point. Client would like the Pathways to be distinct, where you could do all of them and not re-do material.

_MM: Tim Reitz 08/15/2023: client would like to have 1 PDF file per lesson, even combining content from multiple books if needed. Should we still have the separate Resource record?
