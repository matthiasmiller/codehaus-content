4.2. User Groups

  


Requirements

The Solution will use various User Groups to determine permissions for different users. Each user's User Profile is assigned to a User Group. Note that the User Group is distinct from the Contact Type.

  


The following are the User Groups to be used in this Solution. The data access details included here are generalizations (see the Permissions section of this proposal for full details).   

  


  * Admin: Used for FB Personnel to manage the software. Users in this group have access to view and edit all data in the system. 
  * Board Representative: Used for board chairman or other representative to manage a board's account. Users in this group have access to view and edit information for their own organization, sign up for Pathways, and make payments.



  


Development Specification

TODO_IDD: 

Other Notes:

  * The User Groups are hard-coded, meaning that any changes should be coordinated with CH/CCI. 
    * OR 
  * All user groups other than Administrator are set up and configured within the system. This can be done by CodeCrafters/CodeHaus or an admin user.
  * Other restrictions will not need to be specially configured within the Solution, as they are handled by coding.
