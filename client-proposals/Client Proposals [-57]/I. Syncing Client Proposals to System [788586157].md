1\. Syncing Client Proposals to System

NOTE: This is currently only supported for ZCH.

  


To sync a client proposal to a client system, click the Ellipsis button on the detail screen. If no row exists in the subdomains RG (in the Publishing section), add a new row with the:

  * Subdomain
  * Wiki Category in the client system



  


Note that the Dev Spec should almost always be excluded except for internal system.

  


Then, click the "Needs Sync" checkbox, and save. It will automatically sync to the client system with 15 minutes. This will clear the "Needs Sync" checkbox. To avoid save collisions, wait to continue editing the client proposal until the sync has completed.
