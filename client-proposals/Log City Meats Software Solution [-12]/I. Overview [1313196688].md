1\. Overview

  


Requirements

Log City Meats has been processing orders using a paper system up until now. They processed over 1000 deer this past hunting season. They deal with 1600-1800 customers in a 4-week period. When someone drops off a deer, the order goes onto wax paper, which goes in with the deer. The only thing they can do to change the order is to make a note and make sure they catch it when they are processing the deer. At any given time, they have 200-400 deer in the cooler.

  


Their volume has increased so much that it's become difficult to ensure accuracy and timeliness on their orders. They would like to streamline this process using a software solution.

  * I think we can do the kiosk with a multipane report with an ask prompt. Ask prompt for the order number ... left pane to show it as being packaged, right pane with RG report to adjust weights and/or mark as packaged
