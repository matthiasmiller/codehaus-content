8\. Kiosks

  


Requirements

Kiosks will be available for three things:

  * Saving the order's weight after it has been deboned.
  * Marking an entire order as "processed" once it has been complete.
  * Adjusting individual item weights and marking them as packaged



  


After doing research on various Android, Windows, and Apple tablets, we are proposing a Microsoft Surface Go ($480 each). These have a 10" screen and will work well with both the Basic and Advanced Designs (see below). If necessary, they also allow adding a waterproof Bluetooth keyboard and mouse.

  


Basic Design

We are proposing a basic design based on the existing AppHosting solution. We would still have a single screen for the kiosk, although it would not be uniquely designed for 

  


We would prompt for an order number, then a spreadsheet with a basic order summary, along with a list of all items for that order.

  


At the top of the screen, we would show the following buttons:

  


  * Mark Order as Deboned. It would prompt for the new weight, then mark it as deboned.
  * Mark Order as Processed. It would prompt to confirm, then mark the entire order as processed.
  * Mark Item as Packaged. It would prompt for an updated item weight, then mark the selected item as packaged.



  


Advanced Design

We anticipate that the Basic Design will serve the purpose well. However, if we find that the design proves to be unusable, we can design a kiosk that is specifically designed for use on the tablet. We will not need to purchase any additional hardware.
