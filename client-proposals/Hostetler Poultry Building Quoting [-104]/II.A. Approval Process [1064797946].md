2.1. Approval Process

  * In their equipment list...
    * "The Wall" is his whiteboard + sticky notes
    * Most critical component is the equipment takeoff list...
    * They have a COMMITTED DATE that doesn't change.. everything beyond that is relative to the stage of the job and milestone...
    * Struggling with ... these guys move construction & concrete up in front to get as much done as wather permits... that will trigger a cascading effect of everything moving up...
      * if they're moving up those equipment packing dates -- that's 27/26 week lead time



  


  * Ideally.. if that equipment date moves more than 7 days, it would trigger an approval by the supply chain guys who could review...



  


  


  * We could do it based on tasks 27 weeks from that date... so if it moves equipment ordering task to a window less than 27 days...



  


  


Disallow

  * Concrete & Construction - those have 4-6 weeks in the timeline
  * This could be enabled/disabled on a per-phase basis / per mile-stone basis....
