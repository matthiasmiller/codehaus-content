Requirements

  


  


Development Specification

\- Building Specifics will be housed in SmartBuilt

\- SmartBuild generates the specifics / drawings / dimensions / takeoff

\- Will generate a quote based on pricing coming from Paradigm (export / upload scenario) - SmartBuild will basically look at a flat file of prices from Paradigm at a frequency TBD - will push that BOM

\- Will push that BOM over into Paradigm

\- Paradigm Post Frame is their management program

  


  


\- Paradigm will only be used for ACCEPTED customers

\- Mannheim Marketing - explored Sugar CRM; challenge with the CRM is that they need the frontend to be on-prem / inhouse;

They determined that as far as equipment list, the SmartBuild piece will HAVE to come first, because that determines several things -- can't decide length of waterlines, etc.

  


Whether that's an integration between us and SmartBuild, ??

  


* You won't have something in Paradigm until they've completely created a quote -- does that create a timeline issue?

\- SmartBuild Design -> Paradigm -> 

  


* Generate Quotes -> Paradigm PostFrame has an ability to import multiple sets of documents into 1 central place, which would be considered the Quote -- it wouldn't necessarily that it would be 1 single PDF, but you get into that proposed job -- it will do versions of the quote -- get your list of things that will make up the contract. In that case, you will get an export of all the drawings & material list coming in from SmartBuild, then the material & equipment list would be coming in as its own piece as well.

  


\- Paradigm has no problem handling that piece...

  


  


Another big piece to figure out:

\- SmartBuild / POstFrame - let's say we've gone through, made a change to the building, etc

\- This would change part numbres on the equipment, etc.

\- ON paradigm side, it would be handled as a separate version

\- We need a way to link smartbuild, and a way to create copies of our quotes when they copy theirs
