Requirements

This database model transforms the Excel-based poultry building quotation system into a proper relational database structure, maintaining all business logic while enabling multi-user access and improved data integrity.

  


This proposal gives a high-level overview of the data structure. More detail is included in the Quotes package. During development phase, CodeCrafters will work closely with Hostetler to build a quoting tool prototype and then to polish it to a final product.
