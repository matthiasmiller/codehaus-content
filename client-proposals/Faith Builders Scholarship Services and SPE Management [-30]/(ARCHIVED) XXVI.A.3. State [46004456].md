26.0.3. State

We need a report showing all students who have received OSTC tuition scholarships, which should list thestudents, amount of OSTC scholarship scholarship, family income, and number of people in the household (adults plus dependents).

  


We will also need to report summary information for the State audit.

  


This includes:

  * Number of students (not families) and scholarship dollars distributed (only money given directly for scholarships not discretionary funds or admin fee or school charges). These should be broken apart into these categories:
    * EITC Pre-K
    * EITC K-8
    * EITC 9-12
    * OSTC K-8
    * OSTC 9-12
  * Number of applications received. (This is total number of families per school who applied regardless if they received a scholarship or not. Per school means some families will be counted twice because they have children is two different schools.). This should be categorized by:
    * Pre-K
    * K-12
    * OSTC



Number of scholarships and dollar amount by county. We should list all counties, even if no scholarships were awarded. For example: [[File:Report by County.pdf]]
