These merges will be available from the School screen.

  


Family Income

The family income report is simply a list of parents, incomes, adults, and dependents to be sent to the school. This will show all families who applied to the school, regardless of whether they qualified.

  


For example: [[File:Family Incomes.rtf]]

  


These do not get sent by email.

  


Contributions Update / Funds Notice

This report will be able to calculate the available balance of each specific contribution. For example, if a school has only used part of a contribution, it will show as having a partially remaining balance.

  


This report shows:

  * A list of all contributions with fund types and remaining balances, grouped by fiscal year with subtotals and sorted by contribution date.
  * Current balance of Pre-K funds (only if it is a non-zero balance)
  * Current balance of K-12 funds (only if it is a non-zero balance)
  * Current balance of OSTC funds (only if it is a non-zero balance)
  * Current balance of Non-EITC funds (only if it is a non-zero balance)
  * Current balance of all funds
  * The minimum amount that needs to be used for tuition, which is 82% of the available funds
  * The number of families who qualify to receive funds



  


For example (as a starting point only): [[File:Contributions Update.rtf]]
