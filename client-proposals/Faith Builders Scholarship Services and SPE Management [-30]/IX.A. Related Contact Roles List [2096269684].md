9.1. Related Contact Roles List

  


Requirements

This is a user-editable simple list used to track roles of Contacts selected as "Related Contacts" on another Contact record. 

  


The list includes the following hard-coded items (which cannot be edited or deleted within the Solution): 

  * Primary Contact
  * Accountant
  * Secondary Contact



  


The list may also include user-configured items. 

  


This list is universal for all users, and all users can add to it via the "+" option on the drop list on the Contact record. 

  


The hard-coded items for this list are set up by CCI (changes require coding work). The user-configured items can be set up by any user with the necessary permissions.

  


Development Specification

TODO_NM: Tim Reitz 02/18/2025: Is this an XFB-specific list?
