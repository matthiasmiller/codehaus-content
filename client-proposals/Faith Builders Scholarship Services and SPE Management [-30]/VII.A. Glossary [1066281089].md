Overview: The purpose of this glossary is to provide a description of key terms, roles, and other things referred to in this proposal. These are listed in alphabetical order below: 

  


FBSS:

  * Contribution - Money given for one or more schools.
    * School Portion - the amount to send to a specific school (after a 5% admin fee).
  * Distribution - amount sent to a school in a given year. This is the sum of contribution less the 5% admin fee. 
    * Scholarship Portion - the portion of the distribution that is used for student scholarships
    * Discretionary Portion - the portion of distribution that can be used for other expenses by the school
  * EITC (Earned Income Tax Credit) is a refundable tax credit for businesses amounting to an initial 75% of the donation, although this may be raised to 90% for a two-year donation commitment. These donations may be designated through a scholarship organization to any approved school.

  * OSTC (Opportunity Scholarship Tax Credit) - is a refundable tax credit for businesses, with the same ratio of credit to donation as EITC. These donations are reserved for schools in under-performing public school systems.
