2.2.1. Workflow for Businesses

For more information on the FB process, see [https://fbep.org/ministries/fbscholarship/donors](https://fbep.org/ministries/fbscholarship/donors).

  


STEP 1: Send out filled-in application to businesses that have completed it in prior years.

This application will be generated using information from the business's application in prior years. This application needs to include such information as:

  


  * The type of application (Pre-K, K-12, or OSTC). (This type does not necessarily change the likelihood of acceptance with the government program. However, the rollover option does.)
  * The type of business
  * Whether it's a 1st or 2nd year application. This should be inferred based on the prior year's application.



  


These applications need to be in business owner's hands by May 1.

  


Some businesses have multiple applications. Business can get accepted for multiple programs, but each program has a different application. For example, businesses may choose to target around half their anticipated tax liability, running two 2-Year applications at a time, giving them flexibility with their tax commitments since they can alternate one of the amounts every year. They might also choose to apply for multiple programs. Thus, they might be filing Year 1 of 2 for OSTC and Year 2 of 2 for EITC. While we need to support it, businesses like these are the minority. We should keep it simple and cater to the people who do one application.

  


The awards are an all-or-nothing amount, and 2nd Year applications are guaranteed acceptance.

  


The difference between Year 1 filing and Year 2 filing is the change of deadline and the likelihood of acceptance. At this point, all K-12 and OSTC and Pre-K are getting accepted, but it’s getting close. At some point, the new repeat applications will not be likely to be accepted.

  


  


STEP 2: Business Information to FB (Optional)

About 2/3 of businesses send paper application to FB so that FB will file on their behalf. The remaining 1/3 file directly (skip to step “Business Receives Confirmation”). [2017 Business Application](https://fbep.org/sites/default/files/FBSS/2017%20Business%20Application.pdf "https://fbep.org/sites/default/files/FBSS/2017%20Business%20Application.pdf")

  


Businesses must submit a signed application to FB each year.

  


When the business files directly, FB will not likely find out until FB receives the check in the mail.

  


  


STEP 3: FB Application to State

Faith Builders applies to State in an online application on behalf of the business. This is an application for 1 or 2 years and the business commits to a specific dollar amount to contribute. For a 2-year commitment, the business must contribute the same amount for both years.

  


The State application deadlines are:

  * May 15 for renewing businesses
  * July 1 for new businesses



  


FB takes the paper copy and enters it online. There are differences of terminology between the FB paper application and the online State application. Since it’s date-sensitive and detail-sensitive, they highly encourage businesses to have FB file these applications.

  


Once FB files, they receive a 7-page document from the state. They forward this document to the business to close the application loop. We will likely want a workflow to ensure that filing happened and the loop was closed. As part of this workflow, we should include a report showing businesses where the application loop has not been closed.

  


FB uses a single State user account to file for all the businesses. When FB is filing on behalf of the business, they serve as the go-between between the business and the government. If the business has questions, they’ll ask FB and FB will ask the state.

  


When the application is filed with the State, the State assigns an application number. This would be helpful to track, since it allows us to tie payments back to the correct application, as long as the business includes the letter from the State. (If the letter isn't included, we can often infer this based on the timing of the payment.)

  


STEP 4: FB Follows Up with Businesses

FB follows up with businesses when they file on their behalf. They segment their businesses into Year 1 and Year 2 filings (keeping in mind that some businesses may fall in both).

  


The followup sequence works like this:

  


  * When the first business receives their Year 2 approval, FB sends out an email to all Year 2 applicants, letting them know that they should keep their eyes open for the approval letters.
  * A month and a half later, FB sends out another email to Year 2 businesses, asking them to contact FB if they have not received their letter in the mail.
  * The State has a 60-day deadline, so FB will directly reach out to the businesses near the two-month mark, indicating that the 60 days are up and they need the money.



  


This same process is repeated for Year 1 businesses, only on a different time table.

  


  


STEP 5: Business Receives Confirmation

The State sends a notification to the business by mail, indicating whether the application was approved or denied. This can happen as early as August and as late as the following June.

  


Some businesses will call FB to let them know, while others will simply send a check with a copy of the letter.

  


We must note that there are two years:

  * The July-June FISCAL YEAR they apply in
  * The business TAX YEAR they apply for



  


While the State typically tries to get letters out to the businesses' tax deadline, FB still needs to be alert to be sure businesses write their check in their correct tax year.

  


If the time is close, FB will hold a check from the business until they receive an approval letter from the state in order for the check's credit to be in the tax year. If the business is not approved, FB simply returns the check.

  


  


STEP 6: Business Sends Payment

Within 60 days of receiving notification from the State, the business must send payment for that year to FB along with a breakdown of schools to give to. [Recommended Contributions Form](https://fbep.org/sites/default/files/FBSS/Donor%20Recommended%20Contribution%20Form.pdf "https://fbep.org/sites/default/files/FBSS/Donor%20Recommended%20Contribution%20Form.pdf")

  


Business owners sometimes get confused because there are several different important numbers:

  * The total size of the donation
  * The size of their tax credit (i.e. 90%)
  * The amount that the school will receive (95%)



  


Businesses are expected to designate funds based on the total size of their donation. However, sometimes they will designate funds based on their tax credit (i.e. 90%) or or excluding the administrative fee (95%). In these situations, FB takes the liberty to adjust their designations according to their original intent. If their intent remains unclear, FB will reach out to the business to clarify their intent.

  


If for any reason the school has more funds than they can use, they will contact the business and ask where they'd like to send the money as a second option. This happens primarily for OSTC funds, which is only for low-income families. A great example of this is the Bald Eagle Boys Camp, because they can't predict many boys will come in from low-income school districts. If the business can't allocate it to their local school, they'll dump it into Bald Eagle--and Bald Eagle may end up with too many funds and need to have its contributions reallocated.

  


When we receive payment from the business, we must track which fund receives it, based on the application (Pre-K, K-12, OSTC, or Non-EITC).

  


  


STEP 7: FB Processes Payment

When FB receives the check, they deposit it and send the receipt to the state.

  


If FB didn't file the application or never received a copy of the letter from the state, they will send the receipt directly to the business. This is important, because unless they filed the application or have a copy of the letter, FB cannot tell whether the entire donation is coming to FB or to another organization.

  


FB may notify school at this point (see school process).
