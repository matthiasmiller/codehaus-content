11.13. FB Email Template Record

Overview: The FB Email Template record is a custom record that is used to configure emails that are to be sent out to various recipients. 

TODO_NM: Tim Reitz 09/13/2024: Let's give an overview. For example, it appears that all of these records are shipped (cannot be created or renamed in the Solution), but they do have editable fields. It also appears that these are custom to FB.
