16.0.6.1. Auto-Create School Applications

  


Requirements

Accessed from: Faith Builders Scholarship Services | EITC Business Renewal Applications | Auto-Create School Applications

  


This is an import with a prompt for "Copy Applications from Year".

  


The prompt screen also displays the following message: "NOTE: If any applications already exist for the following year, they will be updated to match the default values."

  


Selecting a year and clicking "Continue" creates School Applications for the following year for all active Schools who had an application in the selected year but not the following year.
