Other Notes:

  * Because member applications are not assigned to an approval until the member is admitted, the Pending column will remain blank for all approvals. Because of this, the total row for the Balance will not correspond with the non-total rows.
  * Totals: Include values from the selected Tax Year filter, or include values for all years if Tax Year is blank: 
    * Approved SPE Amount (Show the total contributions for all member applications admitted into this SPE) 
    * Admitted Member Total 
    * Pending Member Total (total contribution for all pending member applications. Because pending applications are not associated with any specific SPE or approval, this number would only be shown on the report's total row. For example:)

  
| See Above Columns| Approved| Admitted| Pending| Balance  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
SPE 1|   
| 100,000| 75,000|   
| 25,000  
SPE 2|   
| 50,000| 0|   
| 50,000  
  
|   
| 150,000| 75,000| 210,000| -135,000  
  
  * Balance (the Approved SPE Amount total minus the Admitted Member Total and Pending Member Total totals. This may be negative if there are more member applications than available remaining funds.)



  


Development Specification

Tim Reitz 01/26/2021: Should this include the Application Name, perhaps instead of SPE since the report is grouped by SPE? Or not since most/all of that info is included in other columns? And just have the SPE column link to the application detail screen? Matthias Miller 01/27/2021: I think it's fine like this.
