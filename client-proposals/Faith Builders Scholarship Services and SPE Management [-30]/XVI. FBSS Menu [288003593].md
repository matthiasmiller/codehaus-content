16\. FBSS Menu

TODO_NM: Tim Reitz 11/18/2025: Our current speccing approach doesn't include proposal sections for each menu option -- we include them in the report & record specs as much as able (i.e. "New Direct Contribution" would be included in the "Accessed from" for the Contribution record spec).

Let's clean up the menu option spec rows below (confirming whether the details are specced elsewhere, adding them elsewhere as needed, and deleting the old rows). This will also help speed up this Proposal record significantly, as more rows seem to slow down a record.
