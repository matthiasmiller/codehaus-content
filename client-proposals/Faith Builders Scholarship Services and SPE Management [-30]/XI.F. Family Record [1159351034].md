Special Considerations: TODO_NM: 

  * Copy Record: Allowed
  * Delete Record: Allowed TODO_NM: Austin Priest 02/28/2025: We have a problem here. It seems that a family record can be deleted at any time with no validation. This is a problem because of the fact that the Family field on student records is read only after first save and required so the student records for the deleted families get stuck in an error state.
  * Merge Record: Allowed



  


Other Notes: 

  * N/A
