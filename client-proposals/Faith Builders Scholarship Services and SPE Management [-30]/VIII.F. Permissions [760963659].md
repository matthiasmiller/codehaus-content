8.6. Permissions

  


Requirements

The Solution includes the following custom permissions:

  


[ ] Can view saved sensitive data (disabled for all users by default; note that Admins can enable this for any user) 

  


[ ] Review contributions (disabled for all users by default; allows a user to edit the "Contribution Reviewed" checkbox on the Contribution record)

  


  


  


Other Notes: (may be included in the proposal or may be deleted)

  * By default, users in the Administrator user group have full access to the whole system.
  * The proposal should refer to specific permissions in the design rather than the user groups that are expected to have that permission.
  * If there is confusion or difficulty thinking in terms of permissions, we may be able to list both permissions and the group names, but this makes it harder to keep the living spec up to date and the coding will be done based on the permissions.
