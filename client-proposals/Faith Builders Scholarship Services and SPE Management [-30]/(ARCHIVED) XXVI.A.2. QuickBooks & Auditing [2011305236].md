26.0.2. QuickBooks & Auditing

  


Requirements

Niccolas Miller 03/10/2023: See accounting reports.

  


We need reports to facilitate reconciliation with QuickBooks and financial auditing. This will be performed as frequently as once per quarter.

  


These reports will prompt for a starting and ending date. These reports must indicate the date range being reported. We will default the starting date to the beginning of the current fiscal year (July 1), with no end date.

Fund Detail Report

The fund detail report will be used in case discrepancies are found between QuickBooks and the software. This will be controlled by a date range, just like the Summary report.

  


For each of the funds, show:

  * The beginning balance for that fund
  * A list of checks written out for that fund, with the school name, total amount, and the amount designated for the fund (sorted by date, then school name)
  * The total donations for that fund
  * The ending balance for that fund



  


School Detail Report

The school detail report will be provided for the FB auditor. This will be controlled by a date range, just like the Summary report.

  


This will list the schools (sorted by name) with their:

  * Beginning balance
  * Donations received (gross amount)
  * 5% admin fee
  * School paperwork fees
  * School check amounts (distributions)
  * Ending balance



  


Distribution by Business Report

This report should also be filtered by a date range, showing:

  


  * Date contribution was received
  * Business (Contributors) Name
  * Total Contribution
  * School name
  * Contribution amount designated per school prior to the 5%
  * Contribution type



  


For example:

  


Date Received| Business Name| School name| Gross school amount before 5%| Contribution Type  
---|---|---|---|---  
30-Sep-16| Business #1| School #1| 10,000.00| K-12
