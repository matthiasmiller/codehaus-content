4\. Faith Builders SPE Management

The Faith Builders SPE Management system facilitates the application of individuals and organizations to Special Purpose Entities (SPEs). These SPEs apply for EITC tax credits, and individual members contribute to reach the entity's total pledged amount. The SPEs then distribute scholarship funds to students attending qualified schools in the state of Pennsylvania.
