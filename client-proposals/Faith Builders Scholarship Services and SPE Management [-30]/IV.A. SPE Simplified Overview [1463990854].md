4.1. SPE Simplified Overview

  


Requirements

Faith Builders is a scholarship organization for a scholarship tax credit program in the state of Pennsylvania. They are currently using AppHosting to manage these funds.

  


The state of Pennsylvania allows Special Purpose Entities (SPEs), which are LLCs dedicated to receiving EITC contributions from individuals as well as businesses. The SPE is comprised of members, which can be individuals or businesses. The SPE applies for tax credits from the state just like any other Pennsylvania business, and the associated tax credits received by the SPE are then passed through to the members.

  


Faith Builders currently has five SPEs. They are currently using an Excel spreadsheet to manage the details. However, they are looking to create a solution to manage these SPEs, member applications, contributions, and distributions.

  


They will manage accounting in QuickBooks, but the solution will include reports to help reconcile the two systems.

  


This proposal includes an overview of the organizational workflow (Simplified Storyline) and the software requirements (following that).
