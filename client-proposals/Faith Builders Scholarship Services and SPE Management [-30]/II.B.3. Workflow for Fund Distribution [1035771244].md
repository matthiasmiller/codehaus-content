2.2.3. Workflow for Fund Distribution

  


Requirements

STEP 1: FB Receives Funds from Business

This is described in greater depth in the "Process for Businesses". The 5% admin fee gets deducted immediately upon receipt of funds.

  


  


STEP 2: FB Notifies School of Funds (repeated).

FB will periodically notify the school of funds received (from Business Step “Processes Payment”).

  


FB will use an Email button to send emails to the school on funds received. If the school has no email, FB will send ad-hoc updates (perhaps 3-4 times a year) via a print button.

  


Whenever they send an email or print copy, it will update the date that the email was sent.

  


  


STEP 3: School Decides to Cut Off Funds.

For September schools, FB will distribute all of the funds in July/August. They will follow up with the school in January to ensure there were no enrollment changes. This contribution cutoff is always June 30. In this situation, FB cannot hold funds for the school because of the State requirement requiring them to distribute the funds within a 2-year period.

  


For November schools, the school can determine the cutoff date. (This is based on the school application.) Any funds after the cut-off point will be applied to the following school year. In some situations, FB may advise the school to wait if it determines that additional donations are likely to come in, given patterns from prior years. These cut-off dates vary from year to year, based on when the State processes funds and based on the school's individual needs.

  


Some Protestant schools have requested funds to be distributed twice per year, once earlier in the year (such as November) and once later (in February or March). We should consider this as an option, listing distributions on the Fund Notification that is emailed or mailed to schools. (This only applies to November schools.)

  


  


STEP 4: FB Calculates Proposed Scholarships. (if FB-Managed)

FB runs calculations for scholarships and sends proposed distributions to school (Award Review). Those calculations are discussed in depth in a separate section.

  


  


STEP 5: School Edits/Approves Proposal. (if FB-Managed)

Once the school receives the proposal, the school will ensure that it is correct and provide any edits to the proposal. These edits are returned by fax, email, or mail.

  


About a third of schools will accept the proposals as presented. Another third will adjust funds to help families that are especially in need. These awards can be manually overridden for each family.

  


  


STEP 6: FB Issues Scholarships.

If FB is not managing applications, they will send checks directly to the school with a letter for that situation.

  


If FB is managing applications, they will:

  * Send the check to the school, along with a letter designating the award amounts.
  * Send a notification of Awards to parents



  


They will send "donor thank you" post cards to the parents (if FB-managed) or to the school (if school-managed).

  


FB does not process any checks from April 1 through July 1.

  


See the "Cut Off" section for the situation when FB issues multiple checks.

  


Development Specification

  * When handling the updated date, consider having a Modify Button that sets a date field for setting the last update date. The email and PDF link require the record to be saved, and they're only visible if the date is set to Today.
