25.1.5. Scholarship Organizations

Most of the contributions go through FBSS, the Faith Builders Scholarship Organization. However, some of the members make contributions to an individual school that has its own scholarship organization.

  


These are Contact records with a specific "Scholarship Organization" contact type. This allows for easy tracking of the contact information for the organization. These records require a Primary Contact to be specified.
