25.2.2. Auto-Create Member Applications (Joinder Agreement)

  


Requirements

AppHosting will include a process to automatically generate new member applications.

  


All admitted Year 1 applications for the prior tax year should be duplicated to Year 2 applications. These should be marked as "Completed by Member" and should continue to be "Accepted by SPE". SPE should be able to edit amounts or mark inactive if a member finds a replacement for all or part of year 2 commitment.

  


All admitted Year 2 applications for the prior tax year should be duplicated to Year 1 applicants if the Renew checkbox is checked. These should be marked as "Prefilled by SPE" and the "Accepted by SPE" checkbox should continue to be set.

  


All non-admitted applications for the prior tax year should be duplicated as Year 1 applications if the Renew checkbox is checked. NOTE: The application type and "Accepted by SPE" can be copied across. However, the Accepted by SPE should never be checked in this case, because these will be flagged by the Overdue Payment reminder. 

  


In all cases, the following fields should NOT be copied across:

  * Payment Due Date (should be updated to September 15 for Year 2 and September 15 for Year 1 (for only admitted member applications for the prior year) no Payment Due Date should be entered for duplicated pending member applications)
  * SPE Application
  * All payment information
  * Admittance date
