26.2. Data Migration from Access

  


Requirements

When we look at transferring information from Access to the new system, we want to keep in mind the trade-off between an import and hand-entering information.

  


The main pieces we need is:

  * Active Business & Application Information (all information for pre-filled business application form)
  * Active School Information (primarily school contact information)
  * Active Family Information (names and contact information)
  * Active Students Information (optional)



  


Our plan for migration:

  * We will create a "Database Migration" school that will receive funds for all 2017 contributions.
  * We will hand-enter Contributions for all businesses that made a 2018 contribution to a school.
  * We will enter beginning balances for all schools.
  * We will adjust the "Database Migration" school beginning balance to 0.00 and mark it inactive.
