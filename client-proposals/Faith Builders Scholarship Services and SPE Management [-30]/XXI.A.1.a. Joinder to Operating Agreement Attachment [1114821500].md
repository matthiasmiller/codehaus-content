The undersigned hereby agrees to become a member of a Faith Builders Special Purpose Entity in accordance with the Operating Agreement, and with the following conditions:

  * The initial contribution is $                      (minimum $3,000). The member takes responsibility for deciding the amount in consultation with his tax adviser. Faith Builders Special Purpose Entities are not responsible for any unusable tax credit issued to a member. The check for year 1 is included or will be sent upon notification of application approval.
  * The member will contribute the same amount in the succeeding calendar year within 30 days of notification by a Faith Builders Special Entity, LLC representative OR the member will recruit a replacement person or entity to fulfill the obligation. In any case, the signer is responsible to provide the same amount for the following year.
  * By signing on the next page, I affirm that I am currently tax compliant with the state of Pennsylvania.
  * I/we acknowledge and agree that there is no expectation for any economic benefit as a result of the investment other than the allocation of the applicable state tax credits and federal charitable contribution deduction.
  * Recommend where you want your contribution directed; schools will receive 95% of this amount after deducting Faith Builders Scholarship Services administration fee.



If desired, change percent of contribution designated for each school, delete, or add schools (total should equal 100%). Enter additional schools on a separate page.
