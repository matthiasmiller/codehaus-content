8.7. Automatic Processes

  


Requirements

The Solution includes the following automatic processes, which can be either "scheduled" (initiated on a scheduled basis), "triggered" (initiated by a certain change in the database), or "user-initiated" (initiated by clicking a button or some other action). These are configured as needed in the Solution at deployment CCI.
