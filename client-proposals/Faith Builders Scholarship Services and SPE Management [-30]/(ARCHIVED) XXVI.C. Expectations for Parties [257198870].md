26.3. Expectations for Parties

Transition from the Access Database

CodeCrafters may use the Access database for design inputs, but will not necessarily try to reverse-engineer the database or its code. FB will answer questions or contact the Access developers. 

  


Necessary data will be migrated to the new database. CodeCrafters will specify file formats for the data. FB will provide data in desired formats.

  


Training

As part of the deployment process, CodeCrafters will provide necessary training to FB on the use of the system.

  


Documentation

The system is designed to be intuitive and usable. If desired, FB can create any desired documentation for processes or for future users of the system. The system will include a free wiki module that can be used for this documentation.
