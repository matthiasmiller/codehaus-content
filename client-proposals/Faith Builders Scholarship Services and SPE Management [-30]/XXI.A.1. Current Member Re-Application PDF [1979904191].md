Template / Fields to be Filled:

  


<Member Name>,

  


As communicated by e-mail, we are anticipating state approval for another two-year period for the Faith Builders Special Purpose Entity (FBSPE) in which you have been a member for the past <# of years; whole number> years. As a current member, you have priority status for another two-year membership period.

  


However, to confirm your continued membership, we require a new Joinder Agreement and your check by <date from the "Deadline to submit joinder agreement and check:" System Switch>. Your contribution will be disbursed to the private school(s) of your choice. You can continue to support the same school(s) as you have in the past or make changes.

  


I am enclosing a joinder agreement pre-populated with current information. The amount you contributed last year was $<"Total Amount" from the Member Application>. The Joinder Agreement lists the school(s) you designated and the percentage each received of your total contribution.

  


Action Steps Required:

  * Review the pre-populated Joinder Agreement for accuracy.
  * Fill in your new contribution amount.
  * Adjust school designations and amounts if desired.
  * Sign the Joinder Agreement.
  * Make your check payable to Faith Builders Special Entity.
  * Mail completed Joinder Agreement and check in the enclosed envelope to arrive by <date from the "Deadline to submit joinder agreement and check:" System Switch> to the following address:



  


Faith Builders Special Entity

28527 Guys Mills Road

Guys Mills, PA 16327

  


If we have not received the Joinder Agreement and your contribution by <date from the "Deadline to submit joinder agreement and check:" System Switch>, we may offer your membership to other interested parties.

  


We remind you of FB SPE operating characteristics:

  * FB SPEs require a minimum commitment of $3,000 per year for two consecutive years.
  * 100% of the contribution will be sent to an approved scholarship organization. We plan to use Faith Builders Scholarship Services, which charges a 5% administration fee and disburses the remaining 95% to schools designated by contributors.
  * FB SPE members receive 90% of their contribution as a tax credit toward their Pennsylvania tax liability. You will receive the supporting tax filing documentation by the first week of February each year.



If you have any questions, please contact us at 814-789-4518 ext. 243 (Justin Kauffman) or ext. 244 (Danny Eshleman) or at [SPE@fbep.org](mailto:SPE@fbep.org).
