15.2. QuickBooks

Matthias Miller 01/26/2022: 

  


  * As an owner and from his perspective, he believes that all he needs to extract from QB is reliable numbers.
  * As far as inventory, from his perspective, if they're going down custom software, all he needs QB to do is to give him the numbers
    * Push the inventory numbers across (P&L and balance sheet)
    * If qantities aren't hard to push across, we could break it down by carload and value, maybe (not usre if that's not a requirement)
  * But it's more effective to do it in the software, they're not far enough into QB, they can
  * They just need to get numbers out of QB



Matthias Miller 01/26/2022: Daily sync of ledger entries to Invetory asset account, matching totals to TOS

  


  


  


  


A/P

A/R

If they're generated a Change Order out of the software, need to push those numbers into 

  


From Ervan

  * Can't think of any reason to line item anything on their jobs
  * The only thing would be to send out invoices to employees
  * They don't do much retail, and that's the only time it would come into play
  * It would make more sense to build a list inside of TOS, and send a lump sump.



  


QB - has the inventoru management that they need, it's almost too comprehensive for them

  * It's set up for retail, selling every piece, counting every piece, etc



It feels like some of the options are too comprehensive

More of a simplified version that they can build out quotes and picking lists etc

But in the end, not have ever item associated wih an inventory

  


  


Matthias Miller 01/26/2022: 

  * Customers
  * Create the invoices
  * Add a single line item for the total



Sales Tax gets sales tax on product when it's delivered, so they're not charging any sales tax on labor

Don't charge sales tax on anything

  


Working out of state, the vendors will ship product, they need to build into the pricing, and take into account Use Tax.

  * If they ever go back out of state, would want to take a look at a better process for that
  * This can be a FUTURE PHASE



  


Matthias Miller 01/26/2022: 

[ ] Make TOS the source of truth, then push it into the invoices

  * Scheduling / Production should have a visual cuue that they've activated a phase, and an invoice is due
  * Should have a cue based on the project



Matthias Miller 01/26/2022: May be phased out in multiple parts, and invoice X/Y, or all of them

  


  


  


Matthias Miller 01/26/2022: 

  * They have 30+ employees, but only 25 who would ask to buy 2x4s
  * Not a retail shop
    * Then a sticky note ends up on his desk,
    * got 5 2x4s
    * used the skidloader
    * 2 boxes of nails
    * roll of duct tape
  * It probably happens more often than you think, sometimes he just throws a number on it, but he almost feels like it should be more organized, they can take what they need, the price is set, and they can turn in an order that they can turn into Holly, and she can extract the pricing



Matthias Miller 01/26/2022: Can be manual Investory Adjustment, then invoiced directly through QB, with line items for rentals

  


  


  


  


Matthias Miller 01/26/2022: 

  * How we deal with line items in PO's (Ervan)
  * They need to be able to catetgorize line items, in the PO, because they use categories for purchasing
  * Tools go in one, insulation in another, but it might be in the same invoice or PO
  * It's mostly for tracking costs associated with each crew, and if they buy 10 different tools, they go to different crews
  * They use subcategories to track where that cost



In the PO, they'd ideally have one that they put together when they buy that, so they can keep track

Run reporting on costs go

  


  


Matthias Miller 01/26/2022: When they receive the invoice, push it across
