15.1. Project Management

Tim Reitz 01/25/2022: Need a place to generate/store the contracts for the work in the database? 

  


  


  


Tim Reitz 01/25/2022: Need a way to track maintenance/warranty work? If yes, what should it handle?

  


  


  


Matthias Miller 01/26/2022:

  * #1 priority is that they can reduce redundancy
  * They have a spreadsheet for PM



When a contractor signs and comes in, Holy enters the cust name, size of building, list of columns, where she enters project phases.

  * with condensed information that gives the operations manager with an aggregated dashboard of the projects in the queue
  * cheduling is done out fo there
  * assigns a build date
  * then jumps to the notes sheet to record what was discussed, then as the project phases are being completed, he will update the spreadsheet by checking the boxes
  * columns with boxes for each of the phases (green, yellow, red)
  * Every phase that is sold, the block becaomes red when it's entered in queue (i.e. not done)
  * Goal to get the blocks into the green.



  


Automating a lot of that with sofwtare

  


Pictures a dashboard for each individual customer, and see these phases at a glance, and then automatically updates in the main

  * Working within the job to make the updates, then at the end of the week (pull up the main view just review everything that we have in view)



  


Matthias Miller 01/26/2022:

  * Operations Manager who does the scheduling, lot of templated emails in folders, etc
  * Where they could have scripted emails and don't copy paste



  


Matthias Miller 01/26/2022:

  * Some tie-ins to drafting and purchasing



  


What he's envisioning, is replacing spreadsheet entries with a dashboard type

  


  


Matthias Miller 01/26/2022:

  * Each bulding could have 3-4 phases
  * Not every one will have multiple phases



  


  


Matthias Miller 01/26/2022:

Most of the setups are using 24/27" monitors

  


  


Prinouts:

  * Material Purchasing
  * Job Work Sheet (8.5x11 printout)



  


They're going to stay with paper on the field, hardcover binder. Five years from now, they might re-evaluate that with a laptop or tablet, but that not's something that he's comfortable he's introducing. Need to be staying with printable versions of everything that needs to go to the field.

  


Phases

  * Initial System
  * Have a printout allocating hours of labor  to phases, and that would be prominent document, or it would be included in a column along the side of a job worksheet, so that the crew going into a job, sees what's budgeted for a job and can set goals for that as well
  * Be able to auto-generate something that would get them close to the budgeted hours, whether it's a separate sheet or a column on the worksheet.



  


Idea from Ervan:

  * Contract vs Job Worksheet
    * Contract gets converted and renamed to the Job Worksheet
    * Sometimes there are notes referencing pricing and discounts, so when processing converts the contract into the job worksheet, they have to decide which notes stay there, and most times everything stays one
    * It would be nice if we could have notes that could print out on the job worksheet for Crew Only



  


  


  


Matthias Miller 01/26/2022: For warranty work, they need a tempalte that they can generate a "Miscellaneous Items" quote, whether it would just be a tab that they could pull up, and of Joe Smith calls him up, and he wants him to come back and install a ceiling liner. There are some nuances with that, but he's going to quote remobilization, some percentage over book price, but need to be able to pull up the base price, roll up some incidentals. Don't want want to re-enter customer information.

TODO_CH - need to roll that over into an agreement

  


Then there would the Warranty Work Order template, where if the customer calls a month after it's completed, and he reports that the door latch is not working, but it's very minor but is not addressed without a system for getting it in queue, pull up a warranty work order, then enter it into the queue for scheduling.

TODO_CH - what is the data model for this?

  


  


With PM, would like to import the hours into the "Jobs in Progress"

  * Scheduling is based on hours, and it's traced back to available man power
  * It would be able to put in how many man hours you've got
  * Then based on that, be 



  


Most customers sign up early, and requests it for a specific date.

Sometimes they will accommodate for an emergency (fire, etc) they'll plan for that.

They need a way to override.

Operations will schedule and refer to notes

  


  


As soon as the contract is signed,

they start looking at it,

Contract goes across Sylvan's desk, when he approves it

It goes to drafting -- they use AutoCad to generate a drawing, check the drawing, approve it

Assign it completed

It goes back down front office desk to Holly. and she sends them out to the customer, and puts the electronic stuff in the customer's folder, which becomes current information that can be pulled out for any time

Always getting revisions

  


NOTE: Minor change order revisions will not go back for processing over Sylvan's desk.

  


What's in the drafting department, they become very detail-oriented, and have a lot of different things and statuses that they show.

  


Sometimes things will go through the drafting process to get preliminary drawings done -- might need to mark it ready for drafting.

  


Need from them:

[ ] Job Drawing Status

[ ] Job in Progress

  * The Job Notes is from the project manager
  * 


  


  


  


Matthias Miller 01/26/2022: 

Sylvan's process:

[ ] Goes through a paper checklist, does an overview of it, inc ase there's anything that should be flagged

[ ] WIll update purchasing status to RED, schdduling to YELLOW, and send it to DRAFTING

[ ] And then they start working on scheduling

[ ] On the other hand, if he sees msising information, then flags it yellow for purchasing, then putting it in the notes, then documenting, and emailing it to whoever should be taking action.

[ ] when a phase goes into In Progress, that's when it gets pulled.

  


Matthias Miller 01/26/2022: 

Customer pulls their own permits

  * Operations scheduling guy is watching that, and he's making sure the permit gets in, and he has a process to he uses to make sure that permit is being worked on



  


1 Call column in Jobs in Progress

  * Every job that they're digging call, is a "1 Call" (call to PA 1 Call), notifying them that you're doing a dig. Form taht they send in, saying they're going to be digging at this location at approximately this date, and the scope of work, and the 1 Call service notifies all utilities, and they respond back saying, "Either we have concerns, or we're clear."
  * If they have concerns, they dispatch guys to mark their lines, gas lines, etc
  * Does that online
  * Track that they sent it -- and the scheduling guy needs to know
    * Gets one sahing that they've received the ticket
    * Gets another one saying that everything's all clear
    * All that their process includes for that, and they'll get to the job side and they're marked
  * If the issue has any kind of concern, they'll call them, Holly will show them where the building is going.
    * If there's a problem, they go to a scheduling guy.



  


  


Matthias Miller 01/26/2022: 

[ ] Delayed Lead times option on the SKU?

[ ] Special Order Items

  * Looking for special items needed (can this be on the SKU)?
  * Aavailable Date will be when it's done/available to pick up
  * Date to be delievered
  * Delivered On (date) and Delivered To



  


[ ] Have it in the pricing system, mark it as a special order.And show it like that in the special order, so simplify Sylvan's review process

  * Perhaps allow a CUSTOM SKU



  


  


From Ervan, what would be ideal is if his PO's could be populated by information that sales has assigned to it

  * Select this option on a PO to go towards that job



  


On the Material Ordering Status, Door and Window tab

  


  * They want to see 2 weeks before the job starts



  


  


Matthias Miller 01/26/2022: My questions:

[ ] Drafting

[ ] Project Management

[ ] What about POs that get generated
