2.2.2. Contacts

  


Requirements

TOS would use AppHosting's standard Contacts module, with some customizations. 

  


Information stored on the Contact would include:

  * Contact Name
  * Phone Number
  * Email
  * Customer Address
  * Details specific to the Contact Type, for at least some of the Contact Types



  


The phone number and email would be links to open a local phone or email application.

  


The contact will also have a read-only QuickBooks ID that will be used to track syncing with QuickBooks.

  


Development Specification

DONE_CH: do we need to be able to handle duplicate names (same and/or different people)?

  * TODO_IDD: Let's do the approach we're using for the Assist CRM
