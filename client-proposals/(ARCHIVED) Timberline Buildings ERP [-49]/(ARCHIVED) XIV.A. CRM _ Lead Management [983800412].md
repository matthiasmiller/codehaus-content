14.1. CRM / Lead Management

Looking for:

  * System to easily capture incoming information (website, set up a customer from that information)
  * Within that CRM, there'd be a customer file where you could have sales notes, pictures, documents
  * It would manage the lead funnel
    * Some categories of where they came from
    * Graphs/Pie Charts
  * The CRM would manage the customer's information during the customer's process, once you've entered the information, you're actively quoting him.
  * Email marketing
    * Maybe there is a series of pre-drafted emails, maybe some with videos attached
    * Maybe there's an email that goes out with an invitation to come see them



  


  * Linked to a VOIP phone system
    * Once you have a customer's information, you could go into that customer, and be able to click-to-call



  


  * Already have a good manual system of working him
    * There are some they put into a non-active file --- "Deadbeat File"



  


  * How does the Pricing / Quoting -- how do you pull pricing



  


From Ervan

  * Regardless of where the job is in the process (quoting / contracting), entering information only one time, then push it other areas
  * Retain it and push it in other directions
  * Don't want to copy/paste



  


  * Have a system where they use the customer's name
  * Have a predetermined format and maybe import it into whatever they're using it, without having  to use the customer's name
    * Material purchasing, if you want to automate it, it takes very in-depth customizable software or spreadsheet
    * Tend to do things for the good of the customer, not shape it for what the industry is doing
    * If they would end up needing to maintain
    * Want to export

Building Size

Options List

etc

  * Then paste it into a specific example



  


  


  


\-----

  


  


  * Contact Name
  * Phone Number
  * Email
  * Customer Address



  


  * Site Address
  * Site Township (based on zip code)
  * Site County (based on zip code)
  * Has to be at a Per-Township Basis (Design Data)
    * Snow Load
    * Wind Speed
    * Frost Depth
    * Example - Lazerne - some townships are 40 points, and some towns over could be 50



  


  * Have a database in the back, or shows that information upfront  based on zipcode



  


  * Lead Source
  * Lead Status (a way to flag lead as non-active)
  * Lead Priority
    * Interested Prospects (short list of names, so they don't drop the ball)
    * 200 leads/month



  


Piricing is set up in zones, by county

  * The further they get out, the higher the price, and just do with a % added to the starting pricing
  * Got six zones -- tying out to zones, then setting a % based on that zone



  


They've got a hybrid system

  * Would want some kind of way to print it out and put it binder sleeves to put it in their desks



  


  * Website has a contact page where people can fill in a form, and it comes in via email
    * These are not necessarily put into the system -- they come from different states
    * Filter the ones that come in, and find out the ones
    * Ideal one -- name, address, phone number, email address
      * Sometimes they're picking a building a 3-digit code for the building they're looking at
      * Some people get more detailed, the size of the building, number of overhead doors, entry doors, windows, attic trusses, overhangs, gutter, insulation, etc (they just select these as yes/no)



  


  


  * Followup Dates?
  * Aggregates active leads, where they're actually at (color code)
  * Ten days, and follow-up



  


  


  * How they're doing it now?
  * When they start a new customer, his file goes into the Timberline Customers folders, then work everything from there. All the notes there are in a live Word document, so every time you talk to him and there's something important enough to record.
  * What's difficult is categorizing the notes -- as in, what matters to who?
    * Salesman's notes to self so he has notes  of what was addressed
    * Site-related information that operations has to pick up -- if you have important site information
    * Not just recording information you talk about...
    * Get it to a centralized location, so the person can extract
  * What they do a lot of as well, is email conversations back and forth
    * What he'd idealize, is if he'd have an impotant conversation in email and organize it so it's there

  * Site Notes
  * Scheduling Notes
  * Pricing Notes
  * All the conversations



  


  


ANybody needs to be able to enter information at any time, and they need to be able to put those notes into the customer

*wants to be able to go into the customer and enter that note himself

  


go into the customer's information, make note -- at the top, you have priing-related, site-related, purchasing-related (tabs or emblem)

  * Then you'd complete / submit and then be done



  


  


They train their sales people to not get too technical, don't want them on the phone

  * Want the information to flow from the customer organically
  * Don't want to walk the customer through a form, just so he can get a quote
  * They are caputuring information the
