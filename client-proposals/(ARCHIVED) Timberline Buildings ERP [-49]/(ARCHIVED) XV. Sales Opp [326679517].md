Matthias Miller 01/25/2022: 

  * In some ways, the CRM has been left behind more than anything, even with how they are as far as automation and so forth.
  * He thinks they're equally important.
  * But they've been more intentional about just keeping things going with spreadsheets and enhancements in pricing/operations, than in CRM
  * It's possible one of the reasons that has happened
  * The return in a good CRM is in your marketing, and can be. They've been marketing all along.
  * Bringing in profitable leads has not been the pain point, and it's been sorting through the leads and makings ure they're only sorting the good leads
  * Lead generation and cost/lead has ...

Tell me a little more about your business--what do you do, what services do you provide? 

  * Pole building provider, serving all of PA, started in 2003
  * We design a project, source the materials through third party providers, and erect the building
  * 160-180 units/year, gross sales $7 million
  * 3 sales reps, 3 part-time admin/support people, a few managing materials, 3-4 crews for erection, 1 cement crew
  * Our vision is to be the most efficient and reliable pole building provider in PA; we are focused on PA
  * We are also preparing to make some changes that will enable us to continue growing with a sub-contractor based model for building erection



  


What are the challenges or problems you're facing? What are you looking to solve with custom software? 

  * We started with no computers or digital accounting; 10 years into it, we got our first computers; we are old order Amish
  * Now we use computers with limited internet access - have whitelisted websites; started using QuickBooks Premiere for accounting and Excel for quoting/project management
  * Job status, cash flow, sales per month, per sales rep, etc. all in Excel
  * Comprehensive quoting system with a lot of functions/codes
  * Since it was all grassroots, everyone built their own spreadsheet
  * Now we have this big hairball of spreadsheets with lots of manual data entry and redundancy
  * May be entering info for projects over 20 times throughout the process from start to finish
  * Lead volume has really spiked - looking for better lead management tools / CRM / email marketing
  * I don't need any more reports; I have all I need; it's the data entry side, the way they're organized and get generated
  * Pricing system works pretty well; already looked at industry software but not convinced
  * I'd like to do some more work on the pricing side; for example, I'd like a master price sheet that I update once rather than having to update prices in multiple sheets
  * To move towards a sub-contractor based model, I need to split out pricing into two categories - labor and material; that way I know how much I am allocating for labor costs on any given project



  


Which challenge is the biggest priority for you to solve? 

  * Redundancy and lack of integration in our current systems 



  


What would success look like to you?

  * Being able to grow leads and sales volume by 5-10% year over year, without having to continue adding support staff; I'm fine adding more to the sales team but would like to keep my admin budget as lean as possible
  * I'm not looking to replace people I already have, but want to make sure we have efficient systems in place so we're not wasting our resources internally



  


What have you looked at so far? What have you found? 

  * Looked at Smart Build - just a design and pricing tool
  * We work with Rosewood for marketing - they're looking into Hubspot for us; that would take care of the CRM / marketing painpoints for us
  * Looking at what more we could do with software we already have in house - QuickBooks Premiere; looking to go to Enterprise version which is more powerful for the accounting side
  * Right now, wanting to build out the project management/pricing side of things



  


Internal notes:

  * Design phase, $5-8k; head designer looks at call notes and says where this project would fall in that range
  * Full project cost, quoted $20-45, 50-75, over 100k; yours might fall into mid-range but it could be less, it could be more; he said he expected this for custom software, didn't seem at all scared off by price
  * Sylvan seems like an ideal client; has a vision for where he wants to go with his company; focused on efficiency; not looking to clone a current system

  * Irvin, drafting manager, joined for this call
  * Oversees things, does the pre-work/design work; helps sales team with preliminary designs
  * Instrumental in the spreadsheets we've developed 
  * It seems to me we'll be okay upgrading QuickBooks for bookkeeping - be able to get the accounting things that we need
  * On CRM side, it's possible we'd bring in an off-the-shelf software for this
  * The gap is the operations and integrations side of things 
  * Integrations with HubSpot and QuickBooks
  * Resistance we may face on our end - individuals have built spreadsheet, now losing control over the system they built
  * It's key we're able to have all current information in one place - that will help us out a lot



  


What would success look like for you Irvin? 

  * Less redundant work - not having to manually update data across multiple places
  * Get rid of the question, "Where does this information need to reside?" "Where does this file need to be stored?" \- We will be on the path to success. 
  * And then everyone will know where to look to find the information, how to run reports to get what they're wanting, when they want it
  * Common way of searching for information - defining how we search for information 
  * Bringing standardized processes to our team and building tools to enable that
  * Teamviewer works for us



  


  * On-call support is a huge plus for us
    * Side note: In the final design proposal you may want to consider whether you would offer an optional "add-on" which would be either Tim or Austin showing up in-person for 1-2 days to help them get everything set up, answer questions, onboard their team; I think this could be a real selling point/up-sell 
  * I think we'll spend as much or more setting up our own "off the shelf" software 



  


I shared 2 options of moving forward

  * $900 engagement - option if you would like time to continue assessing whether custom software is a good fit or not; talking through more of the details for your project to give you more clarity 
  * Design phase - if you feel confident that this is something you want to move forward with and want to get started, this would be an option 



  


Questions for Matthias

  * Integrations with Hubspot, QuickBooks; links from Dropbox? 
  * When should we look at design cost? I told him somewhere between 5-8k for design.
  * ANSWERS: Yes, we can do integrations with Hubspot and QuickBooks; let's do high level design, $2,500



  


Ian Miller 08/05/2021:

  


Q&A

  * Ongoing cost - $200 - $300 / month for data backup and customer support
  * Integration - pulling data from other platforms; this would be figured out in the design phase



  


Idea for moving forward:

  * High level design - $3,500
  * Finishing out the design - based on scope of the project; large designs can total up to $9,500
  * Note: I am seeing I had said in our 7/1/21 call that designs are $5,000 - $8,000; I want to correct that--I should have said up to $9,500; my ballpark was wrong. 



  


Follow up:

  * Ian, put together document outlining high level design
    * This is what we're all working towards
    * This is what we're paying for
    * This is what you need to be prepared for 
    * Note from Sylvan: I am less concerned about how many man hours, more concerned about the time window - will this last 2 months, 3 months?
  * Ian, email Sylvan early next week to schedule follow up call
