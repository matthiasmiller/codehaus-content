4.1. Glossary

  


Requirements

Overview: The purpose of this glossary is to provide a description of key terms, roles, and other things referred to in this proposal. These are listed in alphabetical order below:

  


Pertaining to Members & Membership Management: 

  * Growth Ring Group: A group of members who meet regularly for discussion and accountability. 
  * Organization Roles: There are various categories of users / members. These are tracked via the organization role checkboxes on the Contact records (see corresponding section), and there are various levels of data access controls (see the sections for "User Groups" and "Data Access Controls"). The roles are listed here in order of hierarchy: 
    * Super Admin: A Symbiz board member or other personnel who has login access to view and edit the entire system. (Role defined by User Group.)
    * Regional Rep: Symbiz personnel overseeing a region of Growth Ring Groups. Data access is nearly the same as the Super Admin, but the Rep can only can edit a specific group of Growth Ring Groups and related information. (Role defined by the "Region" record.) 
    * Facilitator: A member of Growth Ring Group who facilitates the meetings. This is a role that changes periodically. A Facilitator has access to view and edit the group for which he is facilitator (including setting the next facilitator, but not adding/removing members), and to view and edit records for members of the group (i.e. their Contact records, Growth Ring Goals, Knowledge Tree Entry records, etc.), and to view other groups. (Role defined by the Growth Ring Group record.) 
    * Member: A standard member (either recently accepted or part of a Growth Ring Group). The standard member has access to view and edit his own records, to view his own group and other groups, to view his own group's Growth Ring Meeting records, to view other members' Contact records, to view other members' Review records, to view Development Resource records, and to view Meetings records. (Role defined by the Contact record.)
    * Lead: a potential member that has not yet signed up.
  * Upline: A user with permission to view and edit another user's information.
    * A Super Admin is an upline of all
    * A Regional Rep is an upline of all members and facilitators in their region
    * A Facilitator is an upline of members in their Growth Ring Group



  


Pertaining to Event Management: 

  * Annual Summit: An annual network-wide gathering for Symbiz members and interested individuals. This is a day-long event with various speakers, workshops, and networking opportunities. The main even is preceded by a "Meet & Greet" networking time that occurs the evening before the event. 
  * "Event": The umbrella term used in this proposal for one of various types of events that Symbiz facilitates, and also for the record type used to track these events.
  * Industry Forum: An event put together by Symbiz for members of one or more specific industries, with industry-specific content and networking.
  * Info Meeting: An event put together by Symbiz to inform interested individuals of the Symbiz Network. This is a large factor in generating new members. Everyone who registers for that meeting is entered as a Lead-type Contact and then added to the Attendance table on the Info Meeting record. After the meeting, a Symbiz team member should follow up with everyone who attended. 
  * KPI: A "key performance indicator", a metric used to track and measure a data point in the Solution. 
  * Launch Meeting: This is a meeting that is scheduled after an Info Meeting, with the purpose of organizing one or more new Growth Ring Groups from leads that attended the Info Meeting. Note that there is only one Launch Meeting per Info Meeting, but multiple Groups may be formed out of the Launch Meeting.
  * Registrant: A Contact (either member or non-member) who has a registration for an Event.
