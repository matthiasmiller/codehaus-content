The following is a basic description of how to manage Regions:

  


Setting up a new Region: 

  * Regions can be set up and managed only by Super Admins.
  * On the Advanced Menu, click "Configure Regions" in the Configuration section.
  * Leave the two filtering options blank and click "Continue".
  * Click "New Region" in the top right corner of the page.
  * Fill in the details as needed.
    * Note that Region Name is a required field.
    * Note that the report at the bottom of the record will display the Groups and Members in that region.
  * Click "Save" in the top left corner.



  


Splitting a Region: 

If a Region needs to be divided into multiple regions: 

  * From the Advanced Menu, click "Configure Regions" in the Configuration section.
  * Select the Region you wish to divide by selecting it from the filtering drop list.
  * In a new browser tab, create a new Region using the instructions above.
  * Save the new Region.
  * For any Group that you wish to add to the new Region, go to that Group's record, click "Edit" in the top left corner, and change their Region from the drop list.
  * Click "Save" in the top left corner of the Group records that were changed.
