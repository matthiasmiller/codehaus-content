25\. Introductions/Onboarding

[ ] Do we have your permission to record our design calls? We like to record the calls for reference later on in the project if needed. Only CodeHaus/CodeCrafters have access to these recordings, and we can delete them at the conclusion of the development of the project. We can also share the recordings with you if you would like to access them later for your own reference.

Matthias Miller 02/06/2023: Their group has been going for about 4 years. They kept adding people to their group for the first two years or so, and then they quit adding people. There wre more requests, and if people wanted to join -- but they were concefrned about how big the group should get before you lose the closeness and standing behind each other and supporting each other. Repeated requests for people wanting something similar, decided why not help other groups start, and be involved with them, instead of expanding their personal groups -- each person stepping into other groups and help support them. That's where their vision started, and in that process -- there were people outside the group who had the similar vision. These two visions started coming together, and mid/end of 2021 is when they applied for a 501c3 status, and actually moved forward with Symbiz. They've had different visions coming together, and finding a way to formulate 1 vision. 

  


  * We love getting feedback on our ads. How did you hear about us and what prompted you to reach out?
    * TODO_: Document the response - maybe on a field on the original Sales Opportunity
    * Matthias Miller 02/06/2023: Delbert had worked with Rubico on getting the wireframes together, and they tried to get them to sign and get started. The board felt it was too high, so they started checking other options. John was sure that we could do better than what they had. Another option they looked at was Salesforce (using it for the CRM) and largely because they give 10 users free for nonprofit.



  


He could build it as extensions on Salesforce for $15K -- but just getting that set up, was frustrating enough -- so that building something like that with him, how that would work.
