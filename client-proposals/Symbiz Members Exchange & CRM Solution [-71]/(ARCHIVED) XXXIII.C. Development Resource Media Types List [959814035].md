Requirements

_IDD: Tim Reitz 05/09/2023: Make this a simple lookup record with 

  * Active (checkbox; 
  * Media Type Name (

This is a user-editable list of media types used for Development Resources. Note that the drop list on the Development Resource record will not include the option to add a new item (to prevent standard users from easily adding new ones), so uplines will need to go to the Lists section in the database and manually add new items there. 

  


The initial list will include the following items: 

  * Print Book 
  * Audio 
  * Video 
  * new: Audio/Video Online 
  * new: Audio/Video Download 



TODO_DH: Tim Reitz 05/10/2023: would you be fine with the above changes? 

  * PDF 
  * Other



  


This list will be universal for all users. 

  


The initial list will be set up by CCI as part of the deployment of the Solution.
