6.10. Event Format List

  


Requirements

This is a non-editable simple list used to track how/where an Event is taking place. It includes the following items: 

  


  * In-Person
  * Virtual
  * Hybrid



  


This list is universal for all users.

  


Note that this sequence is static, so it should always be displayed in this sequence throughout the Solution.

  


This list will be set up by CCI as part of the main development. If changes need to be made to this list, it will require some coding work.
