Matthias Miller 02/06/2023: He doesn't think that it'll be that busy that it's that important to have a chat option. However, they had been having the conversation about whether the other people should be able to see -- they wanted it visible so you don't have 10 people seeing the same question, and may clartify the question even more based on their response -- just having that prior discussion available as far as format, he doesn't really have preferred or specific way that he thinks it should be.

  


Matthias Miller 02/06/2023: If someone adds a new book to the resource list, and I read it a year ago, but my group did not go through the book, is there a way that we can have all the people that read that book, make it possible for them to actually review the book and rate it and give their input, without waiting on the whole group to go through it. THIS IS NOT A THREAD -- just an option to go fill out the first part of the group impact.
