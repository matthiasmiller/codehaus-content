7.1.1. Region Record

  


Requirements

Overview: Regions will be configured on the Region records and viewed on a Regions report.

  


Accessed via: Configure Regions report

  


Sections and Fields:

  * Region section:
    * Active (checkbox; defaults to filled)
    * Region Name (required; plain text; validate against duplicates)
    * Regional Rep (required if active; drop list of all Member-type Contacts; filters down as you type; does not validate against the same Contact being a rep for multiple regions)



  


  * Growth Ring Groups (report at the bottom of the screen; this is the Growth Rings Groups report, filtered to the Groups that have the corresponding Region selected)



  


Data Access: See the Data Access Controls section of the proposal for details. 

  


Special Considerations:

  * Copy Record: N/A
  * Delete Record: Prevent deletion if the record is referenced anywhere in the Solution: "This Region cannot be deleted because it is referenced by another record in the database."
  * Merge Record: N/A



  


Other Notes:

  * These items are to be set up by Symbiz, with help from CCI/CH as needed.
  * Note that this record should have a name, date, and time stamp for Created and Last Modified, as well as a link to access Modification History (standard).
