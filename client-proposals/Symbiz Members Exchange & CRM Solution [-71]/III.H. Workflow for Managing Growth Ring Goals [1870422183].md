3.8. Workflow for Managing Growth Ring Goals

The following is a basic description of how to manage Growth Ring Goals:

  


To access Growth Ring Goals:

  * Open the Growth Ring Goals record through one of the following options:
    * On the Members menu, click "Growth Ring Goals" \- this opens a report of the Goals for all the Members in the selected Growth Ring. 
    * On the Members menu, click "My Current Goals" \- this opens a report of all of the Goals for the logged-in user.
    * In a Growth Ring Meeting record, click "View Growth Ring Goals" \- this opens a report of the Goals for all the Members in the Growth Ring that is having the connected Meeting. 
  * Note that Members can only view the Goals for their Group(s).



  


To create Growth Ring Goals:

  * There are multiple ways to create new Growth Ring Goals:
    * On the Members menu, click "My Next Meeting's Goals" in the My Next Meeting Details section
      * Note that "Growth Ring Group" and "Growth Ring Meeting" are defaulted to the closest next Meeting.
      * Note that if a Member is part of multiple Groups, the two above fields are defaulted to the closest next Meeting.
    * On the Members menu, click "Growth Ring Goals" in the My Growth Ring Group Details section.
      * Click "New Goals" in the top right of the page.
  * Fill in the information in the Goals section as needed.
    * Note that Growth Ring Group and Growth Ring Meeting are required.
  * Click "Save" in the top left corner.



  


If a Meeting gets rescheduled:

  * Change the Meeting Date on the Meeting record.
    * Note that only Facilitators, Regional Reps, or Super Admins can do this.
  * The Meeting Date will automatically be updated on the linked Goal records.
  * The system will automatically send a notification to all Meeting attendees.
  * Any notifications for the Meeting and Goals will update and go out on the new Date, even if they're going out a second time.



  


If a Meeting gets canceled:

  * Change the Meeting Status to Canceled.
    * Note that only Facilitators, Regional Reps, or Super Admins can do this.
  * The system will automatically send a notification out to all Meeting attendees.
  * Goals will be handled at the Group's discretion - either completed with new Goals set for the next Meeting, or the current Goals will be applied to the next Meeting.
    * If the Group decides to keep the Goals and complete them as planned:
      * Don't make any change to the Meeting Date on the Goals record and complete them as usual.
    * If the Group decides to move them to the next Meeting:
      * The Facilitator or each Member needs to open the Goals record and change the linked Meeting to the correct/new one.



  


Additional Notes:

  * Clicking "Previous Meeting's Goals" at the top of the Goals record will open the Goals record for the previous Meeting.
  * Clicking "My Goals History" at the top of the Goals record will open the My Growth Ring Goals report for the selected Member.
  * Clicking "Next Meeting's Goals" at the top of the Goals record will open the Goals record for the following Meeting for the selected Member and Group. If there is no Goals record for the next Meeting, this opens a blank new Goals record with the Member, Group, and Meeting defaulted.
