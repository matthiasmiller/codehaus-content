3.6. Workflow for Managing Groups

The following is a basic description of how to manage Growth Ring Groups:

  


Creating a new Group:

  * On the Admin Menu, click "New Group" in the Growth Ring Group Management section.
  * Fill in the information as needed.
    * Note that Growth Ring Group ID and Region are required fields.
    * Note that the Regional Rep will be automatically selected, based on the selected Region.
  * If you wish to add Members to the Group right away, click the "Add Member" button in the Group Members section and select the desired Member from the drop list. 
    * Note that you can start typing the desired name to filter through the drop list.
  * Click "Save" in the top left corner.



  


Dividing a Group when it gets too large:

  * Go to the Group you want to divide by clicking the "Find Group" button in the Growth Ring Group Management section on the Admin Menu.
  * In a new browser tab (Ctrl + left click), create a new Group using the instructions above.
  * For any Members that you wish to move to the new Group, add their name in the Group Members section of the new Group.
  * In the original Group, click the "Edit" button in the top left corner.
  * Click a Member that you wish to remove from the Group and then press the "Delete" button. This will remove that Member's row from the Group. Do this for any Members that are in the new Group and that should no longer be in the original Group.
  * Save both the original Group record and the new Group record by clicking "Save" in the top left corner of both records.



  


Deactivating a Group:

  * Go to the desired Group's record.
  * Click "Edit" in the top left corner.
  * Make sure that all Members in that Group are moved to another Group.
  * Uncheck the "Active" checkbox.
  * Click "Save" in the top left corner.
