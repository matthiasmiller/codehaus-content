7.1.6. Growth Ring Group Types Record

  


Requirements

Overview: Growth Ring Groups can be designated as different types, such as "Standard", "Business Owners", "Teachers", etc. These types will be configured on the Growth Ring Group Type records and viewed on a Growth Ring Group Types report.

  


Accessed via: Growth Ring Group Types report

  


Sections and Fields: 

  * Growth Ring Group Type section: 
    * Active (checkbox; defaults to filled)
    * Growth Ring Group Type (required; plain text; validate against duplicates)



  


Data Access: See the Data Access Controls section of the proposal for details.

  


Special Considerations:

  * Copy Record: N/A
  * Delete Record: Prevent deletion if the record is referenced anywhere in the Solution: "This Growth Ring Group Type cannot be deleted because it is referenced by another record in the database."
  * Merge Record: N/A



  


Other Notes:

  * There is to be a "Standard" type to be used as the catch-all type until other types are created and implemented.
  * These items are to be set up by Symbiz, with help from CCI/CH as needed.
  * Note that this record should have a name, date, and time stamp for Created and Last Modified, as well as a link to access Modification History (standard).
