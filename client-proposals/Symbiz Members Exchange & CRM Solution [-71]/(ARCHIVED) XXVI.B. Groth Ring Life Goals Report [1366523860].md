26.2. Groth Ring Life Goals Report

Tim Reitz 02/14/2023: This probably is not needed, now that we have moved the Life Goals details to the Contact record. 

  


This is a report of Life Goals records. 

  


It would include the following columns:

  * Growth Ring Group ID
  * Member (link to record)
  * Date
  * Review On
  * Life Vision



  


It would include the following filters:

  * Growth Ring Group ID
  * Start Date
  * End Date
  * Needing Review



  


Buttons: (maybe) New Growth Ring Life Goals (top right of report, opens a blank new record)

  


Access:

  * Visible and editable for Super Admin, the group Facilitator, and the member
