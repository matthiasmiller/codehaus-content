5.9. Automatic Processes

  


Requirements

The Solution includes the following automatic processes, which can be one of the following three categories: 

  * "Scheduled" (initiated on a scheduled basis) 
  * "Triggered" (initiated by a certain change in the database), or 
  * "User-Initiated" (initiated directly by by a user clicking a button or some other action). 



  


These are configured as needed in the Solution at deployment by CodeCrafters.
