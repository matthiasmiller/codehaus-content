8.2.5. Find Member Report

  


Requirements

Overview: This is a report of Member-type Contacts, showing one Member at a time, based on the selected filters. This report normally would not be seen by the users, but would be used to facilitate the "Find Member" option on the Admin menu.

  


Accessed from Admin | Membership Management | Find Member. 

  * Workflow: Clicking this menu option opens a screen with the filter options. When a name is selected on the Name filter and the user clicks "Continue", the Member's Contact record is opened directly, bypassing the report.
