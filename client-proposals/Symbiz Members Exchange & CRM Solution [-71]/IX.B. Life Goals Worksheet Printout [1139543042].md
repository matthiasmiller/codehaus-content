9.2. Life Goals Worksheet Printout

  


Requirements

Purpose/Overview: This is a PDF printout that contains the fields on the Life Vision, Core Values, and Annual Goals sections on the Contact record. This can be printed with fields filled from a Growth Ring Goals record, or it can be printed blank and filled out by hand, for example by a member who does not have internet access. A facilitator can then enter the information into the Solution for the member.
