  * Read-only text containing the following paragraphs:



God puts dreams in our hearts and writes a time and purpose for our lives. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them. Ephesians 2:10. Write down how you envision carrying our your purpose. Your vision should be aligned with your desires, dreams, and passions while honoring your God given gifts.

Write down how you envision carrying out your purpose. Your vision should be aligned with your desires, dreams, and passions while honoring your God given gifts. Futuristic life goals become a guide which keep us focused and engaged even if it takes years for our dreams to be fulfilled. Read Habakkuk 2:2-3.

This exercise is not to plan your life but to keep you focused on a higher calling. Expect detours in your vision, but most often each detour will actually take you into a deeper level of your purpose. This vision will be the lens on how you will view most important decisions and what short term goals you will set. Your short term goals become your focus actions to propel you towards this vision.

  * "By age (number field), which is only (number field) years from now, I envision:"
  * Multi-line plain text field
  * Read-only text containing the following sentences:



A dream written down becomes a goal. A goal broken down into steps becomes a plan. A plan backed by action becomes reality!

  


Note: The Life Vision will be displayed on the Dashboard to keep members focused.
