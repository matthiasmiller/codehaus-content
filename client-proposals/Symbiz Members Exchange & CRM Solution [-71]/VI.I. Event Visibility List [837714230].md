6.9. Event Visibility List

  


Requirements

This is a non-editable simple list used to track/control who can see Event records and details. It includes the following items: 

  


  * Public (visible to all Symbiz members, and eventually could be included on the public Symbiz website)
  * All Members (visible for all Symbiz members)
  * Invitation Only (visible only for members with their name on the Registration embedded spreadsheet and all uplines)



  


This list is universal for all users.

  


Note that this sequence is static, so it should always be displayed in this sequence throughout the Solution.

  


This list will be set up by CCI as part of the main development. If changes need to be made to this list, it will require some coding work.
