1\. Overview

  


Requirements

Symbiz is an organization dedicated to providing goals, accountability, and developmental resources to various employees and business owners around the country. They do this by creating "Growth Rings" of like-minded individuals who are then able to help each other create and complete goals, as well as generally grow. 

  


The purpose of this software solution is two-fold: 

  * Members Exchange (previously referred to as the "Members Portal"): The purpose of the Members Exchange side of the Solution is to create a platform where all of the members can have a place to set goals, keep each other accountable, and share resources with each other. It also is a place to schedule and document meetings, among other things. 
  * CRM: The purpose of the CRM side of the Solution is to replace Salesforce as the CRM and to track details about leads, members, memberships, and other contacts. 



  


As a whole, the software is referred to as "the Solution" throughout this proposal.
