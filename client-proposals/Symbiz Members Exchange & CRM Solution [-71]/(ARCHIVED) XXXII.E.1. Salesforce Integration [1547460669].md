Subscriptions are managed in Salesforce. Automation is one of the last priorities for the solution.

  


This is how the automation should eventually work:

  * As soon as a contact has a paid subscription, copy it over to the portal and make the portal be the source of truth. Have a process to copy changes from the member's portal back to Salesforce
  * As soon as a contact loses their paid subscription, deactivate the contact and keep them from logging in, but keep their information around.
