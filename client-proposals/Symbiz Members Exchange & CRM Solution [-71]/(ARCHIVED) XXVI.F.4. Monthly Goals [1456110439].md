26.6.4. Monthly Goals

Personal scoring system would be nice to see if personal growth is happening but this could be dropped off if too complex for the system.

  


TODO_DH: Tim Reitz 01/30/2023: Consistency on terminology: Currently called different things in different places: Goals, action points, action items?

Matthias Miller 02/06/2023: Action Items - some of these are right before the meeting

  * And while you're at the meeting, through discussion, you might have new ideas that you still want to add to your personal reference. Or may view the book differently after discussing it.
  * All the action items are arround:
    * Closing the last month's meeting
    * Setting up the next months
