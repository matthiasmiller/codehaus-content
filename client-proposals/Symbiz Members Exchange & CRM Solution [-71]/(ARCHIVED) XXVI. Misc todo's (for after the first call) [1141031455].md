26\. Misc todo's (for after the first call)

Project name/subdomain: 

[X] Determine the project name/subdomain (helpful for shorthand reference in the design phase; possibly used the same for reference longer-term)

  * We like to have an internal name to refer to the project. 
    * Choosing this name does not signify any commitment from either side. 
    * For consistency, we like to use the website address where your software solution would be hosting. 
    * The format is something.apphosting.zone. 
    * Sometimes it is: 
      * Simply the name of the business. 
      * The acronym of the business name. 
      * A name that you choose to assign to the software solution.
    * We're looking for something that is short, unique, memorable, and relevant. 
  * Share suggestions prepared as options or conversation starters: 
    * (see HL Design incident)
  * Settled on:

Standard Questions for Each Design: 

  


[X] Do you want to use the calendar date picker? 

Matthias Miller 02/07/2023: Yes -- used some that were frustrating already because they didn't allow you to enter the date.

  


[X] Do you want to import data from an existing system or spreadsheet? If yes, what? 

Matthias Miller 02/07/2023: Contacts from Salesforce

  


[X] Do you want to use time tracking for employees? If yes, by hour or by day and hour? 

Matthias Miller 02/07/2023: No

  


[X] What login format? (Google, Username/Password, or combination) 

Matthias Miller 02/07/2023: Very possible they're not using Gmail - go to a username / password

  


TODO_: Create sections & document the answers as needed.
