3.2. Workflow for Leads

The following is a basic description of how to manage leads:

  


  * Leads can be set up and managed by Regional Reps or Super Admins. 



  


To create a new Lead:

  * On the Admin menu, click "New Lead" in the Lead Management section. This opens a new Lead-type Contact record.
  * Fill in the information as needed.
    * Note that First Name, Last Name, Lead Source, and Lead Status are required fields.
  * Click "Save" in the top left corner.



  


To manage a current Lead:

  * Click "Edit" in the top left corner of the page.
  * Use the Lead Details section to document and track progress on the Lead.
  * If the Lead applies and the application is approved, click the "Application Approved" checkbox. This automatically changes the Contact Type from Lead to Member.
    * Proceed to [[[W0006](https://zch.apphosting.zone/Detail/Edit/2?RecordType=WikiPages&NumberID=-6&)]] - Workflow for Managing Memberships.
  * If the Lead does not apply or if the application is denied, set the Lead Status to "Future Cultivation".
  * Click "Save" in the top left corner of the page every time you are done making changes.
