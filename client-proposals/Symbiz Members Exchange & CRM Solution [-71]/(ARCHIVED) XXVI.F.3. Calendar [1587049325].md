26.6.3. Calendar

Upcoming growth ring meeting and resource info attached

  


TODO_DH: Tim Reitz 01/30/2023: Is this this same as the Growth Ring section, or separate?

  


Matthias Miller 02/06/2023: The way they do it now, the facilitator sets it up and sends the invite. Having the system know that the meeting is Tue morning, so Mon morning it sends the reminder to make sure that you do X / Y before the meeting. What he had envisioned was going into the portal, clicking on the next day, Tue morning, picking a book off the resource -- getting this book off the resource list, or if it's not, you would go in and input the information for the resource list. With that, he hadn't thought about actually incorporating and sending the calendar invite -- he was just thinking on the system side. We can still manually do that. Doesn't think that it's a big issue either way.
