3.12. Workflow for Symbuzz Extra

  


Requirements

Overview: 

  * Members can write up various reports (called "posts") from their Growth Ring Meetings, which are included in a Symbiz publication called "Symbuzz Extra". 
  * Symbuzz Extra is sent out weekly via email/PDF to online members, and monthly via postal mail to offline members. 



  


Writing Symbuzz Extra Posts: 

  * When a Growth Ring Meeting record is set up, the selected Host is automatically set as the Meeting Secretary (responsible for writing the Symbuzz Extra posts). This Secretary role can be reassigned by the Facilitator or an upline. 
  * The day after a Growth Ring meeting, the Secretary receives a reminder that they need to prepare the Symbuzz Extra posts for the meeting. 
  * The Secretary opens the Meeting record and writes out the posts (or, if the Secretary is an offline user, he writes them out by hand on the corresponding worksheet and submits them to the person responsible for entering them into the Members Exchange Solution). 
  * Other Notes: 
    * Note that the Secretary, Facilitator, or an upline can edit the post fields. 
    * Note that the first date that text is entered into one of the post fields is considered the "Post Entry Date". 



  


Reviewing Symbuzz Extra Posts: 

  * Every Monday at 7:00am ET, the designated Reviewer receives a notification reminder to review the posts that have been written in the past week. 
  * Open the report in the Members Exchange in one of the following ways:
    * Click link that is included in the notification.
    * On the Admin menu, click "Symbuzz Extra Posts" in the Symbuzz Extra section.
  * Click "Symbuzz Extra Posts Weekly" in the top left corner of the report.
  * Uncheck the "Hide Review Column" checkbox.
  * Click "Continue".
  * Review the posts and make edits as needed. 
  * Mark posts as reviewed by clicking on the "No" text in the "Reviewed" column, and then clicking the checkbox that appears in its place. 
    * Note that marking a post as "Reviewed" in the report will also mark it as "Reviewed" in the Meeting record.
    * Note that changes will automatically be saved after clicking the checkbox on the report.
  * If any posts need to be changed, the Reviewer can either edit them or contact the corresponding Facilitator or Secretary.
    * Note that the posts will be sent out the following morning regardless of whether the Reviewed checkbox has been checked. 



  


Sending the Symbuzz Extra (Weekly) to members: 

  * Every Tuesday at 7:00am ET, the Symbuzz Extra (Weekly) is sent out automatically to all online members who have the notification enabled. 



  


Mailing the Symbuzz Extra (Monthly) paper copy to members: 

  * Every month on the 3rd Thursday, the designated Super Admin receives a notification that it's time to prepare and send the monthly edition. 
  * On the Admin menu, click "Print Symbuzz Extra (Monthly)" in the Symbuzz Extra section.
  * Set the desired filters.
    * Note that leaving all filters as they are will open a PDF that contains all of the Posts from the month that is displayed in the "Month" drop list.
  * Click "Continue".
  * Review the Symbuzz Extra (Monthly) PDF to ensure that everything looks correct. 
  * Review the Monthly Mailing list to ensure that everyone on that list is supposed to receive the monthly mailing.
    * Export this list to an Excel file by clicking the arrow in the top right of the report and selecting "Excel".
  * Make note of how many names are on the mailing list so you know how many copies of the PDF to print.
    * Note that you can see the number of people in the report by hovering over a name and seeing the "__ of __" in the bottom right corner. 
  * Print the desired amount of copies of Symbuzz Extra (Monthly). 
  * Generate address labels from the Monthly Mailing List Excel file. 
  * Fill envelopes & send them out to everyone on the Monthly Mailing List.
