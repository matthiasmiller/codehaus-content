8.6.1. Growth Ring Goals Report

  


Requirements

This is a report of Growth Ring Monthly Goal records, showing results for one Group at a time. 

  


This is accessed from Members Menu | My Growth Ring Group Details | Growth Ring Goals

  


Clicking the menu option will open a prompt page with the filters below that requires the user to select a Growth Ring Group. If the user is part of only one Group, that Group will be defaulted.

  


Title: Growth Ring Goals for <Growth Ring Group Description>

  


Columns (one row for each Life Branch / goal): 

  * Life Branch 
  * Description (wraps to multiple lines if needed)
  * Make Up Option (wraps to multiple lines if needed)
  * Achieved (Yes / MUO / No)
  * Penalty ($) (total row shows sum)



  


Grouped by: First by Meeting Date (newest / future at the top), then by Member (alphabetically; Member's name is a link to the corresponding Goals record)

  


Sorted by: same sequence as the goals appear on the Goals record

  


Filters: 

  * Growth Ring Group (required; drop list of Growth Ring Group Descriptions that the current user has access to)
  * Meeting (drop list of Meetings for the selected Group; newest Meeting Date at the top; default is blank = all)
  * Member (drop list of Members in the selected Growth Ring Group; default to blank = all) 



  


Buttons: 

  * New Goals (opens a new Goals record with the Member and Group defaulted according to the selections on the report filters, with the following exception: if the current user is not the selected Member or an upline, the new Goals record will be filled with the current user's name for the Member)



  


Menu Visibility: All users

  


Other Notes:

  * This could eventually be made into an editable report so that Goals can be edited from the report.
