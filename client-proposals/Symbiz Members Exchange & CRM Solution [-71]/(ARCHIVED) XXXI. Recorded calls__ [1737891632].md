31\. Recorded calls**

DONE_MM: Tim Reitz 02/16/2023: What do you want to do with this note? (it was in the Printouts section, but doesn't seem to be something that would be included in the Solution??):

  * Doing a call recording, where all the new resource lists, and investment lists, would get listed on a call -- maybe biweekly -- short phone call with updates.
    * Might be a recorded live, and have a Q&A afterwards
    * The others could call in and listen to the recording



Matthias Miller 02/17/2023: Correct. Let's archive.
