36.1. Dashboard

  


Requirements

DONE_DH: Phase 2 (or later)??

TODO_IDD: Tim Reitz 04/11/2023: Yes, this can wait until later. 

  


The Solution will use AppHosting's Dashboard feature for the dashboards. There probably will be one "master" dashboard, with various pieces visible to different user types.

  


The Master Dashboard would include features such as:

  


  * Life Purpose Statement (for all users) 
    * Report that displays the statement + link to member's contact record



  


  * Growth Ring Meeting (for all users) 
    * Report of upcoming meeting details



  


  * Goal Status - Month (for all users) 
    * Bar graph - 1 bar for member, 1 for group
    * Y axis = score points
    * X axis = Life Branches
    * Note that we will need to prorate additional points received from Life Goals Worksheet to the appropriate branch(es).
    * In the graph legend, display the total score for the month (member & group)



  


  * Goal Status - Year (for all users) 
    * Same as Month, but for a year



  


  * Development Resources (for all users) 
    * Report of recently approved dev. resources



  


  * Investment Opportunities (for all users) 
    * Report of recently approved inv. opp.



  


  * Top Five Scoring Groups (for Super Admins): 
    * Bar graph - 1 bar/group
    * Y axis = score points
    * X axis = Group ID



  


  * (maybe) Annual Summit (for Super Admins)
    * Next Meeting Date (auto-generated date field)
    * Address



  


  * (maybe) Industry Meetings (for Super Admins)
    * Report showing the following:
      * Industry
      * Next Meeting Date
      * Meeting Link



  


  * (maybe) Latest Development Resources (for Super Admins)
    * Report showing the following: 
      * User
      * Type
      * Category
      * Status
