7.1.3. Lead Source Record

  


Requirements

Overview: Lead Sources will be configured on the Lead Source record and viewed on a Lead Sources report. These are used to track how Leads came to find out about Symbiz, etc.

  


Accessed via: Configure Lead Sources Report

  


Sections and Fields: 

  * Active (checkbox; defaults to filled)
  * Lead Source Name (required; plain text; validate against duplicates)



  


Data Access: See the Data Access Controls section of the proposal for details.

  


Special Considerations:

  * Copy Record: N/A
  * Delete Record: Prevent deletion if the record is referenced anywhere in the Solution: "This Lead Source cannot be deleted because it is referenced by another record in the database."
  * Merge Record: N/A



  


Other Notes:

  * These items are to be set up by Symbiz, with help from CCI/CH as needed.
  * This could include an option for "Other". 
  * Note that this record should have a name, date, and time stamp for Created and Last Modified, as well as a link to access Modification History (standard).
