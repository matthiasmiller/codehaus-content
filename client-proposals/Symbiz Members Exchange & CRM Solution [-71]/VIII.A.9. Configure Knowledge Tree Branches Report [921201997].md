Buttons: 

  * Add Default Branches (button; visible if the selected Member does not already have all of the default branches; clicking the button runs the "Add Default Branches" background process to create a Branch for each of the active Development Resource Categories in the Solution, giving a new member an initial list of items to choose from)
