6.11. Event Execution Status List

  


Requirements

This is a user-editable simple list used to track various steps / statuses of planning and executing an Event (called "Execution Statuses"). 

  


Initial list items include: 

  * 1\. Plan Event 
  * 2\. Send Marketing Packs
  * 3\. Advertise 
  * 4\. Conduct Event
  * 5\. Conduct Follow-up



  


This list is universal for all Super Admin-type users, and Super Admins can add to it via the "+" option on the drop list on the Event record. 

  


Note that an ordinal number (1, 2, 3, etc.) should be included at the beginning of each item to help with sorting in the correct sequence.

  


The initial items for this list are to be set up by CCI. After the initial setup, the list is manually managed by Symbiz, with assistance from CCI as needed.
