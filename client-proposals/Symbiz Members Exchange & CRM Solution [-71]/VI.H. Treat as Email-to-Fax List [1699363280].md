6.8. Treat as Email-to-Fax List

  


Requirements

This is a user-editable simple list used to track email addresses and domains that are or should be treated as email-to-fax. 

  


List items may include either specific email addresses (i.e. "[name@someemail.com](mailto:name@someemail.com)") or domains (i.e. "@ibyfax.com"). any email that contains any of the items would receive the special handling. 

  


The special handling that these items receive is as follows: 

  * Email-type "New Growth Ring Meeting Scheduled" notifications do not include the .ics calendar invite file attachment. 
  * Others may be added in the future. 



  


This list is universal for all users, and all Super Admin users can edit it by selecting the following menu option Advanced | General | Lists, then finding the list in the left pane (can search for it). 

  


The items for this list are to be set up by Symbiz, with assistance from CCI as needed.
