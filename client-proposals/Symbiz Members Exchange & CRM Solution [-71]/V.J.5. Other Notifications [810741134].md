The Solution includes the following User Notifications:

  


  


Other Notes:

  * If a user does not have an email address set on their Contact record, they will simply be skipped on email notifications that they otherwise would have received.
  * Technical note: Anywhere a specific trigger is mentioned, a Realtime Notification will be used for the in-app notification. A Report Alert will accompany a scheduled task.
  * Notifications with a "Format" = "Member's choice" are configurable on the member's Contact record (see details in the corresponding section of the proposal). If the member is an online user (with a User Profile), they will be able to select in-app alert, an email, or eventually a text message. If the member is not an online user, they will only be able to receive emails (including email-to-fax) or text messages.
  * Note that in a future phase, text messaging probably will be added as an additional option for at least some of the alerts.
