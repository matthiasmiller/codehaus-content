15\. Options for Future Mobile Support

  


Requirements

There are several options for enhancing the UI:

  


  * Mobile-friendly web interface. This would build out a fully customized web interface for members and facilitators that would adapt to both mobile and desktop screens. This would be fully integrated into the core system. Features for Administrators and Regional Reps would continue to be accessed in the main database, but they can use the web app as members and facilitators. A custom web interface for all member features would likely be in the $20-30,000 range.



  


  * Customized dashboard / landing page. We could provide a nice landing page / simple dashboard that is branded for Symbiz with a CodeCrafters footer. This would give a richer feel to the application. Clicking into menu options would take you into the main core system. This option is likely $3-5,000 depending on the feature set. This option is recommended if Symbiz chooses to not do a full mobile interface right away. This is included in the full web interface above.



  


  * Limited mobile feature set. Another possibility is choosing a core set of features that are mobile friendly. This cost depends on what all is supported. It is likely in the $10-20,000 range.



  


Development Specification

Tim Reitz 06/08/2023: Client would like to have estimates for making it easier for use on mobile. Client doesn't think they need full mobile experience (app), but they do think a lot of members will be accessing it during the meetings, etc. Could we give a few options with corresponding ballparks? (i.e. making the AppHosting system (or a few pages) more mobile-friendly; an integration for some of the screen, a mobile solution like ZET)

  


Main things that the client sees would be the things that a standard user interacts with on a regular basis: 

  * Contact Record 
  * Growth Ring Group
  * Growth Ring Meeting
  * Growth Ring Goals 
  * Development Resource 
  * Development Resource Review 
  * Knowledge Tree Branches 
  * And probably something for at least some of the corresponding reports
