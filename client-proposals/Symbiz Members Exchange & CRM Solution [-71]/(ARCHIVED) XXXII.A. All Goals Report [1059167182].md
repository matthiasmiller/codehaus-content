32.1. All Goals Report

  * All Life Goals (visible for admins / facilitators; filtered based on what they have access to)
    * Reverse sorted by date



TODO_DH: Tim Reitz 02/14/2023: How useful/important is it to have a report of all members' life goals? (now that we're storing that on the Contact record instead of a separate record, we wouldn't automatically have a report for it)

  


  


TODO_CH: deactivate this section if not needed.

Matthias Miller 02/17/2023: I don't think it's necessary. We can bring it back if it is.
