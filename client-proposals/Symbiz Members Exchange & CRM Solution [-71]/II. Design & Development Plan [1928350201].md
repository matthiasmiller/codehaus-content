2\. Design & Development Plan

  


Requirements

This project is being done in phases, with the full scope of the High-Level Design used as the guide for what is included. The approximate plan for design and development is as follows:

  


Phase 1: This phase includes the most important features of the software, including the following (see the proposal for this phase for full details): 

  * Core system
  * Initial configuration records and settings needed for Phase 1 features
  * User Notifications 
  * Contacts & Contact Type Record & Report
  * Growth Ring Groups Record & Report
  * Growth Ring Meetings Record & Report
  * Growth Ring Goals Record & Report
  * Development Resources Record & Report
  * Development Resource Reviews Record & Report
  * General Meetings Record & Report
  * Knowledge Tree Entry Record & Report
  * Member Directory Report
  * My Growth Ring Meetings Report
  * My Growth Ring Goals Report
  * View Knowledge Tree Entries Report
  * Knowledge Tree Quick Entry Report
  * Life Goals Worksheet Printout
  * Growth Ring Worksheet Printout
  * Resource List Printout (from report)
  * Member Directory Printout (from report)
  * Confidentiality Agreement Printout
  * CRM Features (to replace Salesforce; not included in the initial scope of the High-Level Design)
  * Amazon S3 Integration
  * Data Migration
  * Initial Solution Deployment & Training



  


Phase 2 & Phase 3: This includes secondary features. The idea is for a Phase 2 to be designed within a few months of the Phase 1 design, so that it can be deployed along with or soon after the the first phase. A Phase 3 could follow a few months later. These phases would include the following (final breakdown to be determined):

  * Knowledge Tree Record & Reports
  * Investment Opportunities Record & Reports
  * Discussion Threads & Comments (Records & Reports)
  * Info Meeting Record & Reports (CRM feature; not included in the initial scope of the High-Level Design)
  * CRM Dashboard & Graphs (CRM feature; not included in the initial scope of the High-Level Design)
  * Additional User Notifications: 
    * Review Investment Opportunity Notification
    * New Investment Opportunity Notification
    * OId Investment Opportunity Notification
    * New Development Resource Notification
  * Additional Printout: 
    * Investment Opportunity Printout
    * Knowledge Tree
  * Additional Integrations: 
    * Twilio Integration
    * QuickBooks Integration
  * Scoring Feature for Members and Groups (involves changes to various records and reports) 



  


Mobile-Friendly Interface: This came up as an important need at the conclusion of Phase 1 design. Since this is a significant feature that was not included in the original scope of the High-Level Design proposal and ballpark estimate, this is handled as a separate feature with an additional price tag.

  


Possible Future Development: Other features may be brought up as nice to have, but not important or valuable enough to include in the initial main scope. These are included in a "Possible Future Development" section at the bottom of this proposal, if applicable.

  


Development Specification

NOTE: We should try to keep this up to date.
