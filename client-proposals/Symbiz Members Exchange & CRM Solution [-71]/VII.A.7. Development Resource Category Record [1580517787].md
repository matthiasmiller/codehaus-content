7.1.7. Development Resource Category Record

  


Requirements

Overview: Development Resource Categories will be configured on the Development Resource Category records and viewed on a Development Resource Categories report. They are used to categorize the books and other resources that are used by members and groups.

  


Accessed via: Configure Development Resource Categories report

  


Sections and Fields: 

  * Development Resource Category section: 
    * Active (checkbox; defaults to filled)
    * Category Name (required; plain text; validate against duplicates)



  


Data Access: See the Data Access Controls section of the proposal for details.

  


Special Considerations: 

  * Copy Record: N/A
  * Delete Record: Prevent deletion if the record is referenced anywhere in the Solution: "This Development Resource Category cannot be deleted because it is referenced by another record in the database."
  * Merge Record: N/A



  


Other Notes:

  * These items are to be set up by Symbiz, with help from CCI/CH as needed.
  * Note that this record should have a name, date, and time stamp for Created and Last Modified, as well as a link to access Modification History (standard).
