7.1. Inventory Management

Inventory management will be added in Phase 5. This may include some custom reports similar to the current inventory management spreadsheet, including columns for:

  * preferred vendor
  * number of orders from past 2 months
  * current amount in stock
  * difference (stock - orders from past 2 months)
  * current purchase orders
