3.7.1. Protocol Printout

The protocol printout will prompt for:

  * Protocol
  * Customer (hidden until phase 2 is implemented)
  * Sections (corresponding to list of sections on protocol screen; multi-select)



  


This will generate a PDF with the respective information from the protocol. This will be a relatively simple layout, utilizing the NewLight logo and basic brand colors.
