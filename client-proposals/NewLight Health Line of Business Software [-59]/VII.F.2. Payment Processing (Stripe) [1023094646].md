7.6.2. Payment Processing (Stripe)

  


Requirements

The line of business software will use the prebuilt integration with Stripe for payment processing, pending card processing rates. If necessary, the software will integrate with a different payment processor.

  


Development Specification

TODO_IDD - We'd still need to build out the integration/portal.
