    * For consistency, we like to use the website address where your software solution would be hosting. 
    * The format is something.apphosting.zone. 
    * Sometimes it is: 
      * Simply the name of the business. 
      * The acronym of the business name. 
      * A name that you choose to assign to the software solution.
    * We're looking for something that is short, unique, memorable, and relevant.
