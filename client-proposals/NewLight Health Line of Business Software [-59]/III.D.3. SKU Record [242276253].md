3.4.3. SKU Record

The software will include the standard AppHosting SKUs module.

  


Inventory management will not initially be included in the line of business software, but the option could exist in the future, if the choice is made to switch from QuickBooks.

  


Inventory items will be synced with QuickBooks. This includes:

  * SKU
  * Description



  


It will also include additional custom fields, such as:

  * Primary Product (checkbox; filled by default)
  * Related Products (list of SKUs for the same product in other sizes; visible if Primary Product)
  * Serving Size (single-line text; always visible)



  


The Related Products cannot contain any Primary Products, and vice versa.
