5.1. HIPAA Compliance

  


Requirements

It's not clear whether introducing the practitioner portal will invoke HIPAA requirements. At this point, it's possible that PA's new licensure for naturopathic practitioners may open a path where HIPAA does not apply.

  


If HIPAA does apply, any information to which HIPAA requirements apply will need to be hosted either on premises or on a third-party platform, and not in the AppHosting solution. Full responsibility will be on NewLight to meet maintenance, security, and backup requirements for all such information.
