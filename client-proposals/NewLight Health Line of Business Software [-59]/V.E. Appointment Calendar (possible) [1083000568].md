5.5. Appointment Calendar (possible)

The Practitioner Portal may include an appointment calendar, either as a link to a third-party scheduling app or to a scheduling tool within the line of business software.

  


This could involve one of multiple choices:

  * Adding a time field on the consultation, and providing a simple report/calendar with consultations
  * Downloading an .ics file that can be imported into Outlook
  * Manually creating appointments without any formal integration
