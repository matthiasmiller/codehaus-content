Ian Miller 05/05/2022: 

  


Talked with Amos and John

  * Amos - owner, managing the company
    * Sylvan, Timberline is my brother-in-law
    * Reached out to Clyde Zimmerman for guidance
  * John - just came on end of February, in the marketing



  


What we do

  * Retail vitamins, supplements, health products
  * Most clients are the Plain community
  * We do a bi-annual print catalog 
  * We use internet with Compass Foundation filtering
  * We're having tremendous growth year over year
  * We are managing orders in QuickBooks and using ShipRush to fulfill 
    * This is working well for us



  


History

  * My father does Lyme coaching, testing
    * He started Natural Hope Herbals in 2010 ([https://www.naturalhopeherbals.com/](https://www.naturalhopeherbals.com/))
    * Manufacturing herbal tinctures, salves, etc. 
  * I was looking for something else to do and in 2012, decided to start a mail order catalog 
    * Includes Natural Hope Herbals as well as 300+ other vendors
    * 3,000 SKUs
    * Natural soaps, toothpastes, health products
  * We print 40,000 catalogs twice/year
    * 30,000+ customers in our database
    * We include informational/educational articles in the catalog
  * Now we get regular calls from our customer base asking for health information
    * Income is through the supplements, no charge for phone consultations



  


Top priority: Health protocol database

  * We want to have health protocols in a database that all employees can access
  * Our priority is educating our customers
  * Need an easy-to-use catalog of protocols with sound information
  * EXAMPLE:
    * Ian's calls in, asking about psoriasis 
    * Whoever receives the call opens up our database and opens the "psoriasis" protocol
      * Key questions to ask
      * Information about signs and symptoms
      * Testing options
      * Natural home remedies to start with
      * Recommended products
      * Article links that can be shared with the caller



  


Another priority: Product catalog that syncs with InDesign

  * Product database
    * Product name
    * Description
    * Price 
    * SKU
  * Sync price with QuickBooks (depending on cost to do this)
    * Pulling price from QuickBooks
    * Not pushing information to QuickBooks; only pulling price
  * Currently, we use Carlisle Printing for our design and printing
    * Carlisle has a custom software where we can input all the data for our catalog
    * They have web interface
    * They have custom software where we can input all the product data for our catalog
    * This syncs to their InDesign where they design the catalog, do graphics design, etc. 
      * Syncing product name, price, item number, etc. 
      * Possibly syncing informational health articles as well 
  * We want to move towards doing all our own designing in-house
    * Why we want to bring design in house
    * Better design control and consistency
    * More control over schedule control, so that we're not relying on them to meet our deadlines
  * Would like to have a product catalog in our database that syncs with InDesign similar to the way it works with the custom software that Carlisle Printing uses to sync



  


Other pieces we may want to implement down the road

  * Easy price updating
  * Articles & recipes - linked in protocols, pushing to print catalog as well
  * Quick notes - place to record information that we're learning about health 
  * Phone catalog of protocols
    * Caller can call in, select the protocol they want to hear more about
    * Recording plays about selected protocol 
    * Thinking big--not sure if this is possible or not
