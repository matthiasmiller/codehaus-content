5.1. Archive RTO Documents

My proposal for the sales form:

  


  * Executed Contract (checkbox)
  * Executed Contract Date (required if checkbox is checked; defaults to Today)
  * Executed Contract (S3 Document Key)



  


Josh will then attach the executed contract to the sales form, then populate the fields.
