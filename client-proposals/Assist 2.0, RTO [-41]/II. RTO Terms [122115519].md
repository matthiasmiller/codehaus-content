2\. RTO Terms

Add an RTO Terms lookup type:

  


  * Name -- (For example, "36 Months")
  * Months -- numeric field, 0 decimals
  * Divisor -- numeric field, 1 decimal



  


The Divisor is used to calculate the monthly price, instead of an interest rate. For example, Monthly Payment = Total Price / Divisor.

  


Add a Configure RTO Terms report. Pull all 3 fields in there. Sort by number of months
