6\. Contract Template

We will have an RTO Contract template. This should be a lookup type.

  


Fields:

  * Name (automatic based on state; you can only have 1 contract per state)
  * State
  * Contract Text (evaluate in context of sales form record)
  * Notes (rich text; never printed)
  * Disallow increased security deposits (checkbox). Note that security deposits are not allowed for CRA contracts.



  


Add a memo field to the Sales Order for the evaluated RTO Contract. Evaluate it when clicking the Calculate RTO checkbox.
