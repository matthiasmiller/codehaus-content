3.19. Tracking Calls & Followups - Reporting

We would provide a Confirm Stops report that would show:

  * Name
  * Address
  * Phone Number
  * Items
  * Instructions
  * Confirmed? (editable)
  * Prior Attempt Type
  * Prior Attempt Date/Time
  * New Attempt Type (editable if not confirmed)



  


The New Attempt Date/Time is automatic and does not need to be added.

  


The New Attempt would show the same list as the embedded spreadsheet in the stop detail. Selecting it would add a new row to the spreadsheet for the current date and time.
