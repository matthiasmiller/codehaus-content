3.5. Route Scheduler - Date View

  


Requirements

This will add another menu option "By Date". It will open an empty screen with an "Add Date" button that will prompt for a specific date. You can add multiple dates for a comparison view.

  


Development Specification

Tim Reitz 09/15/2020: This will have the date picker since it's in the NHM database, correct?

Matthias Miller 09/15/2020: This will actually be an Integration, so it'll be a little different.
