3.10. SMS - Prior Stop Notification

If a guest has opted into text notifications, send an SMS when the drivers open the phone's GPS for that stop. Use the phone's current location to determine the distance to the next stop.

  


Allow referencing:

  * First Name
  * Minutes Away



  


The text message can be customized but would default to:

"[First Name], we're on our way. We'll be there in approximately [Minutes Away] minutes."

  


We do not need any variation or range in the number of minutes.

  


This text can be customized.
