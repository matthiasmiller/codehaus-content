3.3. Route Optimization - End Time

  


Requirements

We will add a Default End Time column to the Route settings. In addition, this can be edited on a per-date basis.

  


On the Route Scheduler, highlight all stops that will prevent the truck from returning to the warehouse by the return time. However, we will not specifically prevent over-scheduling.

  


Development Specification
