6\. Permissions

  


Requirements

ManuFood will include various restrictions/permissions for data access. This can control which users have access to different portions of the software or different types of data such as: recipes, daily operating costs, markups, accounting data, etc.

  


Certain records and/or field could be considered "password protected", and only accessible to specific users. If these are edited, the system would generate an email for the change that was made (see the corresponding section of the proposal).

  


Development Specification

What data access restrictions/permissions do you want? 

  * Matthias Miller 12/09/2022: 
    * Quality Control (recipe - ingredients and amounts; "head cook")
    * Accounting (certain aspects of passwords - daily operating cost, markup; "chief accounting")
    * For anything that's password protected, the system would generate an email for the change that was made.
