1\. Overview

  


Requirements

Kuntry Kettle is an Amish-owned copacking business in southern Illinois, run by a father and son. James, the father, started it in 1986, making apple butter and later added jam. Since then, it's shifted from its own brand to a copacking business. Samuel, the son, is the general manager of the business.

  


They've been working with an Anabaptist Financial coach to clarify their processes, and this is next step in the process.

  


Their goal is twofold:

  


1\. To provide traceability and inventory management for Kuntry Kettle in an ongoing effort to automate and optimize their business.

  


2\. To explore the possibility of creating software for the copacking industry for businesses in the $1-10MM revenue range. Small businesses are running on Excel, and larger businesses are using enterprise software. While they are working on research, they believe it's possible for a fairly significant demand in this middle range of business. Note that this is being considered as a possibility at this point, and further details can be developed in the future.

  


Daily use/data entry into the software would be done by a remote data entry person.
