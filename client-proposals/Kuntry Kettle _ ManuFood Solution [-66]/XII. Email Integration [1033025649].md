12\. Email Integration

ManuFood will use AppHosting's standard Email Reminders feature as a starting point for automated emails. This would be a great way to send a monthly report of completed work, as well as sending the weekly current/work in progress reports (every Wednesday).

  


The email alert for edits on "password protected" items would be a separate email generated by the Solution.
