17\. Initial Information

Tim Reitz 11/30/2022: Text from the original Sales Opportunity: 

  


Heidi Coblentz 08/19/2022: Ellis had a conversation with them. Here are his notes.

  


This was a PA Dutch sales call. They remembered an ad that mentioned that and would have been fine with English but really enjoyed talking Dutch.

  


The client knew about me and were one of the ones that had asked the receptionist for my number. He saw one of my earliest ads and it really made a good impression on him and knew that he wanted to work with CodeCrafters if he'd ever get a chance.

  


Kuntry Kettle is an Amish-owned business in southern Illinois.

  


The father started in in 1986, making apple butter and later added jam.

  


The are now a large plant doing custom manufacturing and private label of hot fill food -- jams, salsa, etc.

  


Worked with Leonard Medder (name ?), an AF advisor, since 2015. He was familiar with Excel.

He offered to do inventory control and pricing in Excel as a part-time gig while he was fighting cancer.

He mostly finished Master Material List and linked to individual customer file recipes.

He passed away several weeks ago.

  


Their accountant took over the project and is working on it right now.

They have locked down word processors -- Linux and Libre Office, non-calculating without Excel formulas, maybe limited spreadsheets.

Tim Reitz 11/30/2022: Talk about tech - how to integrate with their machines/provide internet.

  


Accountant concerned to use Excel spreadsheets -- how tightly are things held together.

  


They are thinking that they will have someone else do data entry and manage their system.

Tim Reitz 11/30/2022: Discuss possibilities here.

  


They are pretty interested in the possibility of getting reports by email and maybe even doing queries by email.

Tim Reitz 11/30/2022: Discuss possibilities here.

Matthias Miller 11/30/2022: Possibly a phone interface, and a generic record that lets us configure these reports / menus?

Matthias Miller 12/02/2022: Always be measuring the COST vs the BENEFIT.

Matthias Miller 12/02/2022: It's a given that there's a data entry person in a remote office. Move this as a "POSSIBLE FUTURE ENHANCEMENT".

  


They know Mark and Gabe well and will be interested in talking with them.

  


They are wanting to track inventory, lots, prices, recipes, and orders.

Tim Reitz 11/30/2022: Preliminary records:

  * SKUs
  * SKU Lots
  * Recipes
  * Orders



  


 Ideas of queries:

  * How much product of SKU ___ did client ___ order last year
  * Manufacturer informed us of arsenic in batch _____ of baking powder. What client orders and which items was this included in?
  * What should be the calculated price for recipe ____ given current prices
  * Export of Excel files to be imported into QB



Tim Reitz 11/30/2022: How to do queries?

Matthias Miller 11/30/2022: It depends:

  * Do SKUs have letters AND numbers? If so, can we guarantee uniqueness via T9?
  * Could we give them a report of customers by ID, and let them enter customers by ID? Or would we do T9 of first 3 of last name and first 3 of first name? Could we do based on phone number?
  * How many clients do they actually have?



  


Tim Reitz 11/30/2022: Preliminary custom reports:

  * Sales by Client (



  


Matthias Miller 11/30/2022: QuickBooks

  * Pricing automated
  * 


  


They will be entering data every day on what is manufactured, including what lot number of ingredients are used.

Matthias Miller 11/30/2022: Could we have a call-in number to input what is manufacturered? Not sure...

Matthias Miller 12/02/2022: Data entry person for this

  


Some day they may be open to terminals, but that is not phase 1.

They have full email access, but no internet.

Tim Reitz 11/30/2022: What is their email access? via fax?

Matthias Miller 11/30/2022: NOTE - Electsys is hosting their email - electsys.tech

  


Explore whether there are ways to upload data by email and have it imported into the system. Alternatively they send it to someone for data entry.

Tim Reitz 11/30/2022: Discuss this.

Matthias Miller 11/30/2022: Can they send email attachments, like Excel etc?

Matthias Miller 12/02/2022: Lonnie converter -- some Excel attachments are problematic -- and it prints it on 7 pages because it lines it up across the pages. PDFs always handle the best. Cannot open it on their word processor. Matthias Miller 12/07/2022: Emails need to come as PDF

  


  


They are paying their accountant $50/hour which seems steep for data entry. Is this an opportunity for Stephen to build out data entry for people?

Tim Reitz 11/30/2022: Or find someone else to come on board for data entry?

  


My sense is that this is a small to medium system if we don't do a lot of two-way email integration, but could be come larger with email automation built in.

Matthias Miller 11/30/2022: Do we need to track inventory, and/or do any inventory management (i.e. FIFO/LIFO pricing etc)?

Matthias Miller 11/30/2022: Yes

Matthias Miller 12/02/2022: Same pricing for all companies. What they were doing before, they put in the everyday price -- and if the best-price option changes, that price is updated. When they buy 5-6K peaches at a lower price, they didn't change the pricing in the master price list, and they benefited from that. This is more of a detail -- but his thought that every purchase should be listed, so you can see that they bought peaches six times, and the cost of each purchase, and the average price for a rolling 12-month -- i.e. a form just for peaches showing that -- then there might be a separate field, where if they look at 12 months

  


Matthias Miller 12/02/2022: But freight has been a different animal, and brought in a load of tomatoes at an exorbant rate, and they didn't update their pricing because they had 0.02/lb because of that -- one side they lose and one side they gain. The prices are not fixed in a quote that they cannot change, but if it does change, they need to justify, and they would not appreciate it if they changed the price of jam up and down a few cents a case. Price changes usually only happen once or twice a year.

  


Matthias Miller 12/02/2022: Do we handle PO's and Vendor Invoices in here as well?

  


  


Ellis Miller 09/30/2022: I reached out today. They had been busy with a family wedding and remodeling. Samuel asked a number more questions:

  


What if you go out of business? Explained the resilience of having CodeCrafters as a larger company, but also with CodeHaus and Digital Bridge as backups. He isn't worried, but just thinking through worst case scenarios.

  


What if we want to sell it to others? Discussed possible options:

  * They refer and we build custom for others, paying them a referral fee
  * Their system is standard enough that we can sell it to others directly and we have some kind of revenue share.
  * They do sales and support and we simply provide the software.



It's not something he has specific plans, but was just exploring what could be options.

  


He needs to talk with his father. He's inclined to get on the schedule for High Level design. November and December are their busiest months, but he would still consider doing the High Level in November if possible.
