Matthias Miller 12/02/2022: Their perspective and goals -- they discussed this briefly with Ellis -- another reason that keeps them automating and optimizing, that drives it forward -- but in addition to that, they think (and pending research) that there is demand in the industry of either smaller companies using Excel, or mega corporations that works for multi-site. They think that there may be a fairly significant demand -- if they can make where it's 95-99% usable out of the box or off the shelf, and it is another interest they have in this project. They believe going through the design process will help. 

Matthias Miller 12/02/2022: They're looking at single location for $1-10MM revenue

Project name/subdomain: 

[ ] Determine the project name/subdomain (helpful for shorthand reference in the design phase; possibly used the same for reference longer-term)

  * We like to have an internal name to refer to the project. 
    * Choosing this name does not signify any commitment from either side. 
    * For consistency, we like to use the website address where your software solution would be hosting. 
    * The format is something.apphosting.zone. 
    * Sometimes it is: 
      * Simply the name of the business. 
      * The acronym of the business name. 
      * A name that you choose to assign to the software solution.
    * We're looking for something that is short, unique, memorable, and relevant. 
  * Share suggestions prepared as options or conversation starters: 
    * Name: 
      * Kuntry Kettle 
      *     * Domain: 
      * kk
      * kuntrykettle
      *   * Settled on:
