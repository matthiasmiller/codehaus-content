2.5.1. Incidents: Shadow Assignee

Incidents would have an additional Shadow Assignee field, which would allow specifying a mechanic to shadow a project. It would never affect the shadow mechanic's scheduling or availability, but it would allow them to be assigned to specified jobs.

  


You will be able to adjust the amount of actual shop time for apprentices to allow them more time for shadowing.
