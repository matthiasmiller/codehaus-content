2.5.4. Incidents: Time Tracking

Time spent on incidents will be tracked via time cards. These can be viewed in the demo system at [https://demo.apphosting.zone/](https://demo.apphosting.zone/) and clicking Open Time Card.

  


Staff will be able to clock in and out. When they clock in, they will be able to specify an incident ID that they're working on. It will show an ellipsis button to make it easy to choose from recent or assigned incidents.

  


The incident will include a billable checkbox. This checkbox will only be visible to individuals who have permission to view billing information. In addition, it will show the following information:

  


  * A list of names and billable rates. The default rate will be loaded from the Contact record. An entry will automatically be added for the incident assignee when the incident is marked as billable.



  


  * The incident will show a red warning (and warn on save) if it's missing rates for one or more employees.



  


  * A link to view the detailed hours worked on the project



  


  * The billed rate per employee, as well as the total billed rate.
