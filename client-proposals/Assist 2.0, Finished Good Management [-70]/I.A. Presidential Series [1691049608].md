1.1. Presidential Series

The Presidential Series buildings are built anytime  there's a lull in production. These are high sellers that are placed on holding lots. The dealers will be able to see them on the portal, can see what's available, and can sell directly off the holding lot. These buildings go straight to logistics.

  


Unlike dealer lots that are designed like a show room, these lots are systematically arranged to allow quick and easy access for delivery.
