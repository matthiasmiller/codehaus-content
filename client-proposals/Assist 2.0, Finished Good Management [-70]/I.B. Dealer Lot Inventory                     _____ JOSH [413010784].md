1.2. Dealer Lot Inventory                     <<<<< JOSH

We want to have automatic inventory of all of the dealer lots. This is 95% of the challenge with finished goods management.

  


The secondary issue, which would be nice to solve but isn't primary, is theft prevention. The most cost-effective approach is per-building tracking on lot buildings. If we can accurately locate these buildings, this could help the drivers quickly locate the building that they need to deliver.

Matthias Miller 09/25/2020: Fun question...could you use triangulation to calculate the position? Perhaps place transmitters in the corners of the lot for basis/calibration? (Looks like RSSI is not accurate enough for positioning.)

  


 It's likely that having this tracking on RTOs will prove to be cost prohibitive.

Matthias Miller 09/25/2020: You can extend battery life with an accelerator, and only transmit the location when it's actually moved. [https://www.airfinder.com/product](https://www.airfinder.com/product)

Matthias Miller 09/25/2020: One option is having a QR code w/ device to scan, which records location...

  


  


One idea was being able to give haulers the exact location of the building so they don't have to hunt through all the buildings.

  


Knowing where each dealer lot is, each building, etc

Some crazy ideas about RFID and GPS tagging

Matthias Miller 09/21/2020: Most GPS units are $150/unit -- issue w/ batter life issue, and most are at the 2.5-3yr mark. Need a cellular plan to ping back their location.

  


Matthias Miller 09/21/2020: Could make RFID inaccessible except when it's on a trailer...or can we trigger an event when it's moved?
