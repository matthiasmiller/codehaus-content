2\. Permissions

  


Requirements

The software will include two permissions for users:

[ ] Can view/edit Gemeinde Brief

[ ] Can view/edit Church Directory

  


Users can access the Gemeinde Brief, the Church Directory, both, or neither.

  


These can be configured on a per-user basis by the administrator.

  


Directory users can be disabled after the directory is published to avoid paying for these users in the years between publication.

  


Development Specification

Ellis Miller 04/21/2021: 

[ ] Add two permissions

[ ] Add restricted data rules for all record types:

[ ] Church -- either Gemeinde Brief or Church Directory

[ ] Magazine Entries -- Gemeinde Brief

[ ] Magazine Entry Types -- Gemeinde Brief

  


[ ] "Gemeinde Brief" menu page visibility -- Gemeinde Brief

4 hours.

  


We will not rename these record types. Churches are shared with Church Directory. Magazine Entries are currently limited to Gemeinde Brief, but could be expanded at some point (probably by moving the Gemeinde Brief layout to one detail screen and creating a separate detail screen for other magazine, unless they literally want the same kinds of fields).
