2.15. Migration

  


Requirements

We will migrate any guests who've had more than 1 stop in the recent past (exact time frame to be determined). We will optionally exclude Apt/Lot addresses. We will provide a preview of the results for review before the final migration.

  


We will not migrate any stops across.

  


We will export the Stops by Month and the Stops by Zip Code reports to Excel for future reference.

  


Development Specification

Matthias Miller 09/23/2020: 

[ ] Blindly clone the Contacts Import x30 into an ZNH-specific "Std Migrate Contacts.r20" and the Building field and Apt/Lot# columns to the end. (We won't have to maintain this long-term.)
