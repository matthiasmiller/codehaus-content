1\. Project Overview

  


Requirements

The client has an existing system they use for managing their pickup and deliveries. However, it is built on an outdated software platform that is not receiving heavy active development. Keeping the existing system up-to-date isn't cost-effective long-term. However, we must address existing security concerns, while making it cost-effective for continual development.

  


The client has evaluated another software solution. However, that system lacks critical features from the existing system, such as:

  * Being able to easily move stops in a schedule.
  * Being able to assign custom lengths for each stop
  * Allowing the software to automatically calculate stop times.



These features are important to keep in the new system.

  


Neither system meets all of their needs. They would like to upgrade their existing solution to add additional features, as well as lay the foundation for developing a donor list and effectively marketing to them (through SMS and email). 

  


We migrate the new solution to the AppHosting.zone platform and integrated with the existing AppHosting.zone software subscription.

  


The client refers to its customers as "guests". We are mirroring this language in our proposal and solution.

  


This proposal includes three levels:

  * Phase 1 - Migrating the existing system with minimal changes
  * Phase 2 - The above, with additional enhancements and features
  * Phase 3 - Long-term marketing enhancements (not included in the quoted price)
