3.25. Online Scheduling Options

On the routes setup screen, we will add an embedded RG for schedule by zip code:

  


Zip Code| City| Weekday  
---|---|---  
12345| Anytown| Monday  
Etc| Etc| Etc  
  
  


These would be used to determine the default day for the online pickup and delivery.

  


When entering a new stop, default the stop date based on the first unlocked, non-holiday date for that zip code. If the stop date doesn't match the zip code, show a warning but still allow saving.
