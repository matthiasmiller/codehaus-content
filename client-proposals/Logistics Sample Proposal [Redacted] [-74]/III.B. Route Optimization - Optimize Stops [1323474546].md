3.2. Route Optimization - Optimize Stops

We will have an option to select multiple stops and rearrange them them in the optimal order for speed. If there's a Break stop in the list of stops, it will be placed in the middle of the stops for the day.

  


We will add checkboxes beside each stop in the Schedule view. These checkboxes can be toggled via a Ctrl-Click, or via a Select All box at the top of day's schedule.

  


When 3 or more stops are selected, an Optimize Stops button will appear to the right of the Select All checkbox (at the top of the day's schedule).

  


When optimizing stops, we will always group deliveries together (and optimize them) at the beginning of any selection, followed by pickups (optimized at that point). If the selected stops were not adjacent previously, they will all be grouped together with the first stop after being optimized.

  


Multiple stops can be moved around on the same day or multiple days. If they are not adjacent, they will be grouped together when they are moved.
