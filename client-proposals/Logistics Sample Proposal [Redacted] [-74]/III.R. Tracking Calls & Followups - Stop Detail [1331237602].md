3.18. Tracking Calls & Followups - Stop Detail

We will have a way to track phone calls and follow-ups. The stop detail would have:

  * Confirmed checkbox (saving date/time) 
  * An embedded Attempted spreadsheet of date, time, and attempt. The attempt would be a choice of:
    * Left Message
    * No Answer
    * Sent Text



  


The spreadsheet should become read-only after the stop has been confirmed. The Sent Text would be automatically added with the first outbound message confirming the stop. If the user confirms, it would automatically update the Confirmed checkbox.
