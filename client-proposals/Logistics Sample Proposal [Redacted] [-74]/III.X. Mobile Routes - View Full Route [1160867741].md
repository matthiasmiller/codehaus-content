3.24. Mobile Routes - View Full Route

  


Requirements

We will provide an option to view the full route on mobile. The home screen will show all routes (as described in Phase 1) with two buttons:

  * View Route
  * Start Route



  


The View Route will show a read-only view of a map and all stops, as displayed on the Route Scheduler. Clicking on a stop will directly open the Mobile view of that specific stop.

  


The View Route screen will also include a button to Start Route.

  


Development Specification

Matthias Miller 08/27/2020: Perhaps use the Desktop View, or just make something new. Completely disallow scheduling on mobile regardless. It's just too likely for bad things to happen.
