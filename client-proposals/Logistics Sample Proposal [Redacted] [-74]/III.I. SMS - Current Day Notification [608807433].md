3.9. SMS - Current Day Notification

If a guest has opted in to text notifications, send them a message on the morning of their scheduled delivery/pickup. The times would be set on a per-day basis in the Scheduled Tasks settings.

  


The text message should be able to reference:

  * First Name
  * Stop type (pickup/delivery)
  * Start time
  * End time



  


The Start Time and End Time should be a 2-hour window based on the projected arrival time (an hour before and an hour after).

  


The text message could be customized but would default to:

"[First Name], your [stop type] is scheduled between [start time] and [end time]. We'll send you a text when we're nearby."
