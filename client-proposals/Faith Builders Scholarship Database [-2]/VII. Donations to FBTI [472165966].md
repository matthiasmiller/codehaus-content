7\. Donations to FBTI

FBTI (termed "School #69") plays a unique role in this system.

  


The state of Pennsylvania requires that 80% of all funds are designated to a school, based on the total donations. Because FBTI is a college-level school, it doesn't qualify for that tuition designation. However, it is eligible for discretionary funds, which will fall under an OSTC/Pre-K/K-12 designation. These discretionary funds are redistributed by FBTI as scholarships.

  


This process works because FBSS schools are limited to a 13% discretionary fund, which is below the state limit. The total discretionary funds, including donations to FBTI, cannot exceed 15% of total donations. In almost all situations, FBTI could receive amounts totaling up to 2% of all donations.

  


This school does not require any special treatment, except that it is not subject to the standard 13% discretionary limit. For this school, the student section would always remain blank.
