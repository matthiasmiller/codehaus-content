13.5. PDF: Family Application

We will need the following reports/merges for the family application.

  


The "Application Confirmation" form. For example, see [[File:Family Application One Confirmation.rtf]].

  


Note that will has an optional paragraph for families that were denied because of high income:

  


Your income, unfortunately, exceeds the limit established by your school. Unless you inform us that the information on this record is incorrect, you will not receive any further mailings from us.

  


To emphasize this, we will bold the first sentence in the template (as above).

  


The Email Confirmation option. This emails a copy of the PDF with additional text in the body. The subject is "Application Confirmation | Family ID: 1348" and the body reads as follows:

  


Dear John,

 

We have received your application for scholarship assistance.  Please review the attached document for accuracy, and contact us if any information needs to be corrected.

 

Sincerely,
