Before getting too deeply into this process, we need to understand that schools choose to operate one of two ways:

  * Some schools will use the money the same year that they receive it (November Schools).
  * Some schools wait until the following school year to use the money (September Schools).



  


The advantage for the school of waiting until the following year is that it simplifies the budgeting and planning process.

  


  


STEP 1: FB Sends Application Packets to School

Send the application at the first of March for September Schools (schools that wait until the following year to use the money). These schools will issue grants in July/August.

  


For November Schools (schools who want the money right away), send the application packets at the end of March or beginning of April. These schools will cut off funds by November 30, or as late as February or March if they anticipate receiving more funds.

  


  


STEP 2: School Applies to FB.

The school returns the application form.

  * [School Application 2017-2018](http://www.fbep.org/sites/default/files/FBSS/FBSS%20K-12%20School%20Application-2017-2018.pdf "http://www.fbep.org/sites/default/files/FBSS/FBSS%20K-12%20School%20Application-2017-2018.pdf")
  * [Service Options](http://www.fbep.org/sites/default/files/FBSS/FBSS%20Scholarship%20Service%20Options%202017-2018.pdf "http://www.fbep.org/sites/default/files/FBSS/FBSS%20Scholarship%20Service%20Options%202017-2018.pdf")



  


In the application form, schools must indicate whether they're eligible for OSTC funds.

  


The schools can allocate some of the funds towards a discretionary fund. About half of the schools will opt for all funds going all to tuition (1A). The remainder of schools can take some of the funds for discretionary funds. (See details on calculation.)

  


The school can decide whether it will manage the scholarship process (collecting parents’ tax forms, etc) or whether FB will do so. FB charges $13/family to process applications. This fee only applies to families that were accepted into the scholarship program, and is deducted when FB calculates the awards for the school. See [http://www.fbep.org/sites/default/files/FBSS/Template%20for%20Schools%20doing%20own%20paperwork.pdf](http://www.fbep.org/sites/default/files/FBSS/Template%20for%20Schools%20doing%20own%20paperwork.pdf). FB does paperwork for approximately 2/3 of the schools.

  


Schools must specify whether whether they are a September or November school (see description above).

  


Schools can also specify more stringent income requirements for the scholarships. However, only a minority of schools do this. The State limits also need to be adjusted from time to time.

  


School may choose to withdraw. This is rarely for a better program, but perhaps because of no funds received.

  


  


STEP 3: Parents Apply to FB. 

(if FB-Managed) Parents will send in an application along with a copy of their tax form for income verification.

See [Family Application 2017-2018](http://www.fbep.org/sites/default/files/FBSS/FBSS%20Family%20Application-2017-2018.pdf "http://www.fbep.org/sites/default/files/FBSS/FBSS%20Family%20Application-2017-2018.pdf")

  


FB includes the income of all dependent children, whether or not they file separately.

  


Most family applications are very similar to prior years, except they need updated income and each student needs to be advanced by a grade.

  


  


STEP 4: FB Processes Parent Applications. (if FB-Managed)

When FB receives a parent application, they enter it into their database and send a confirmation to the parents.

  


If possible, they send an emailed confirmation. If this isn't possible, they print a copy to mail to them. The confirmation includes the information from the application in case the parent misspelled or provided incorrect information.

  


FB currently has no process to ensure that parents receive this confirmation, so it's possible that parent applications get lost. This hasn't been a significant issue, but it's possible.

  


We must track, on a per-child basis, whether that child is eligible for OSTC or has a learning disability. We will also need to track which county the family lives in.

  


  


STEP 5: FB Processes School Application.

When FB receives a school application, they will enter it into their database.

  


However, it's not a strong requirement that schools send in their application. FB will receive around half of the school applications.

  


This only becomes an issue if the school applies income limits for their scholarship.
