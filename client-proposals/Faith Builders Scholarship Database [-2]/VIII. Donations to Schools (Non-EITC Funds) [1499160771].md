8\. Donations to Schools (Non-EITC Funds)

Businesses sometimes want to make private, anonymous donations to schools. These donations are used for school scholarships.

  


In this case, FB takes the 5% administrative fee and puts the remaining funds into the "Non-EITC Fund".

  


Note: Because these are private donations, FB could technically send the donation to the school as a "discretionary" fund. However, this isn't the intent, and it's easier to process these donations the same as everything else. In addition, this prevents FB from becoming the stop gap for channeling private donations.
