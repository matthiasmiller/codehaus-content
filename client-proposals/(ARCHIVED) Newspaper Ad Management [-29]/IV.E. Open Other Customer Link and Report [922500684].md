4.5. Open Other Customer Link and Report

  


Requirements

The Customer/Ads Page will have a "Open Other Customer" option, to be able to open another Customer/Ads Page from one that is already open. This will be a link that prompts for the current page to be saved, then opens a search page. 

  


The search page would have search bars for the following: 

  * Customer (this would show results as you type)
  * Primary Contact
  * Phone
  * Fax 
  * Email
  * Include Inactive (checkbox; default to unchecked)



  


If there is only one match for the selected prompt information, clicking Continue would directly open the Customer/Ads Page for the selected customer. 

  


If there is more than one match, clicking Continue would open the Open Other Customer report. This report would have the following: 

  


Columns: 

  * Customer Name (link to Customer/Ads Page)
  * Primary Contact 
  * Phone 
  * Fax
  * Email



  


Filters: Same as the Open Other Customer search prompts

  


Grouping/Sorting: 

  * Group by Active/Inactive (if including Inactive)
  * Sort by Customer Name



  


 Clicking on the Customer Name would open the Customer/Ads Page and complete the search.
