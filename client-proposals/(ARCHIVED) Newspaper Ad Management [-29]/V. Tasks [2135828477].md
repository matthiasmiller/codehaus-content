Development Specification

Tim Reitz 11/11/2020: He likes the way Asana is set up. He became familiar with this. Also Trello. 

  


They call in, I create a customer contact and ad schedule, and on the same page be able to start a conversation about the ad. This is linked primarily with the ads. Not shared with the customers. Wants to be able to carry on a conversation, go back and edit notes. Wants to be able to create tasks a few weeks or months ahead of time.
