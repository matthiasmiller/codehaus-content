9\. Advance Publication Date

  


Requirements

The system will not advance Publication Dates automatically. There will be a menu option called "Advance Publication Date". The publication date can be advanced by the Full Admin, or by any Publication Admin or Standard User assigned to the publication. Clicking on this menu option will open a page with the following prompts: 

  


  * Publication (required, list of publications, default to blank; for publication-specific users, show only their assigned publication; for Full Admin show all)
  * Next Publication Date (auto-filled and read-only)



  


Confirming this by clicking "Continue" will advance the Publication Date across the entire selected publication. 

  


There should be validation to not allow the Publication Date to be advanced if there are uninvoiced ads for the current Publication Date. For this, give an error message when clicking "Continue", such as "The Publication Date cannot be advanced because there are one or more uninvoiced ads remaining for the current Publication Date". 

  


Incomplete Tasks from the previous date will advance to the new date, still marked as Incomplete.
