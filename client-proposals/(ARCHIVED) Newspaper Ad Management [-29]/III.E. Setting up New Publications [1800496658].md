3.5. Setting up New Publications

  


Requirements

Setting up a new publication could be done by either CH/CCI or by PNP, depending on how the system is built. Note: This is to be determined before the final proposal. 

  


If it can be done by PNP: 

When you want to set up a new publication, you can log into the database as the Full Admin User, go to the Configure Publications Report, and set up a new Publication by clicking on the "New Publication" button at the top of the report.

  


There will be instructions provided for setting up a new publication.

  


Development Specification

Tim Reitz 12/22/2020: NOTE: If it simplifies development to require new publications to be created/set up by CCI/CH, that is fine with the client. It isn't very important to him to be able to set them up himself.

We should determine this before the final proposal, if possible. Matthias thinks it shouldn't make much difference which way we go with this, but if the client can have instructions and do it himself, that would reduce the support burden on us.

Tim Reitz 03/23/2021: Ellis, you can let us know your thoughts and we can make adjustments to the Requirements as needed.
