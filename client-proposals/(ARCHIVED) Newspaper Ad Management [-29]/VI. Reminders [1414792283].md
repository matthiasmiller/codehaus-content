6\. Reminders

  


Requirements

The Reminders feature is being designed in full at this point, but it might be developed in a future phase. This is a feature that would be nice to have, but is not of high importance at this point. 

  


The  Reminders feature is used in conjunction with the Tasks. A user can create Reminders for a certain date and time, and for a given Assignee ("Send To" recipient). Users will be able to see each others' Reminders.

  


Each Task can have one or more Reminders set at a time.

  


When a user selects the "Create Reminder" option on a Task detail, a new tab would open with a blank Reminder Detail. Selecting the "View Reminders" option opens the Reminders Report, filtered to show only results for the current Customer.

  


Development Specification

"Send to" recipients: Anyone with a login can receive Reminders. This should be publication-specific for Standard Users and Publication Admins; Full Admins would show up as options for all publications. 

  


Data Restrictions:

  * Full Admins: Full access
  * Publication Admins: Full access for assigned publication (tracked via a selected Task on the Customer/Ads Page)
  * Standard Users: Full access for assigned publication (tracked via a selected Task on the Customer/Ads Page)
