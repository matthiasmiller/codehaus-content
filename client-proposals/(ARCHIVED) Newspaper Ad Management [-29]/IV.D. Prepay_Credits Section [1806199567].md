4.4. Prepay/Credits Section

If or when the prepay/credit feature is included, there will be a Prepay/Credits section on the Customer/Ads Page to keep track of the customer's prepay amounts. You will be able to add credit and view their current amount from this section.

  


The credit information will be stored on the Customer/Ads Pages. 

  


Customer credit balances may not go below $0.00. 

  


The Prepay/Credits section will have the following: 

  * Total Available Credit (read-only; sum of all positive and negative credit amounts on this customer's Paid invoices)
  * Total Uninvoiced "Pay with Credit" (95%) (read-only; total of all scheduled uninvoiced runnings of "Pay with Credit" ads, minus the 5% Prepay Discount)
  * Total Credit to Collect (read-only; difference of "Total Available..." and "Total Uninvoiced..."; default to 0.00 if "Total Available..." is greater.
  * Create Prepayment Invoice for Balance (link; visible if "Total Credit to Collect" is greater than 0.00; generates and opens an unsaved invoice for that customer; see more details in the "Adding Credit" section of this proposal)
  * Custom Credit to Collect (number field to two decimal places; default to blank)
  * Create Prepayment Invoice for Amount (link; visible if "Custom Credit to Collect" has a value entered; generates and opens an unsaved invoice for that customer; see more details in the "Adding Credit" section of this proposal)
  * View Credit Information (link; opens the Customer Credit Information Report - see corresponding section of this proposal)



  


When calculating available credit, the Total Applied Credit on the invoice is deducted immediately when the invoice is marked Invoiced; Total Purchased Credit is added once the invoice is marked Paid. This applies to the Total Available Credit above and the Credit Balance in the report.
