6.5. Overdue Reminders Alerts

There will be a daily Overdue Reminders Alert that sends an email and gives a System Notification alert at a set time, such as 8:00am, if there are any overdue reminders that have not been dismissed. These would only go to the "Send To" user for the overdue reminder(s). 

  


The email would include a list of My Reminders that are overdue and a link to the Overdue Reminders Report. 

  


The System Notification would open the Overdue Reminders Report directly.
