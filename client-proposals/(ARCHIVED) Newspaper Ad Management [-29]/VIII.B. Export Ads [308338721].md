8.2. Export Ads

All ads for a selected Publication Date should be exported into a new dedicated folder on the computer desktop. When this batch export happens for a selected Publication Date, just the finalized, approved images (normally PDF or JPEG) go into the Export Folder. Other ad details do not need to be exported. 

  


Clicking "Export Ads" on the menu should open a page with the following prompts: 

  * Publication (required, list of publications, default to blank; for Publication Admin and Standard Users, show only their assigned publication, for Full Admin show all)
  * Publication Date (the date should default to the current Publication Date)



  


This would be confirmed by clicking "Continue".  The system would then create a ZIP file with all the ad files for that date. It can be downloaded and saved as desired. After it has been downloaded, it simply needs to be extracted to the desktop. 

  


The ZIP file (and the extracted folder) would have the Publication Date as the title, in the yyyy-mm-dd format (e.g. 2021-01-31).

  


Any user can run this export. 

  


As noted in the notes about the Ads Detail Section, there would also be the option to download an individual ad file from the Ad Details.
