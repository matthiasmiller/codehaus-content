21.2. Sales Opportunities

  


Requirements

The AppHosting Sales Opportunities could be helpful as a sales management software to track workflow, stay on timelines, etc.

  


Development Specification

TODO_: Consider whether this should be included in Phase 1, Phase 2, or Possible Future Enhancements. 

Note that including this would mean including the standard Incidents module, which could complicate things with the OH-specific incident feature.
