22\. Possible Future Features

  


Requirements

The following features could be considered in the future (but are not included in the current price estimates or quotes):

  * Time Cards / time tracking for employees (Would want to consider how to have safeguards, like only allowing employees to clock in/out from the office. Maybe a time card machine, or a dedicated time card user (with the employees not able to edit time cards from their own user profile).)



  


  * Print driver sheet from program: Internal form that goes with the driver to log his miles, receipts, track the temperatures of the animals, and currently they just fill one out in Word every time they dispatch a driver. All that information is in the program, and the idea behind it is to create this as a PDF for them



  


  * Edit Driver, Departure time, date & Vehicle from preview screen



  


  * Order Search -- this might be less of an issue going forward if we split out dispatch (maybe null and void)



  


  * Driver week at a glance: Displays departure time/date, delivery location, and time; used to send out to drivers. This could be simple report emailed out to them, or visible via online access for users. Could think of a Hauler Portal or Cockpit.



  


  * Auto-fill default/standard delivery time for customers (still be able to edit as needed): Sometimes customers want deliveries at a certain time / day.



  


  * Possibly link delivery price to delivery location



  


  * Alert when customers stop ordering: Probably a field on the customer record to alert if they don't order more than X days.



  


  * Mobile Portal: There will be support for tablets automatically with Phase 1. In the future, we could create a mobile interface for the drivers. No offline support will be required.



  


Development Specification

  * Move Notes to Right side so its larger.
