1\. Overview

  


Requirements

Oak Hill Genetics was started in 1989 when a pig farmer was asked to provide pigs for medical research. Since then, the business has grown and they now provide both pigs and dogs (mongrel hounds and beagles) to many locations for medical research. In recent years, Oak Hill has started their own delivery service where they deliver their own animals, as well as animals from other companies, including competitors. They deliver all over the U.S. and Canada and have a main location in Illinois, as well as a satellite location in South Carolina that was started to service a customer in Atlanta.
