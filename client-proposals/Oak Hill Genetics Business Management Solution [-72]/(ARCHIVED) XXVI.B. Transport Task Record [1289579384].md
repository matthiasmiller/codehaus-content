26.2. Transport Task Record

TODO_MM: Tim Reitz 04/03/2023: Leaving this for you to explain a bit more since it was your brainchild

  


Overview: TODO_MM

  


The record includes the following sections and fields:

  


Transport Tasks -- could assign any myriad of combinations to that....

Matthias Miller 03/22/2023: Do NOT want to autocreate these tasks, and there are a pretty unlimited amount of scenarios, they go to specific cities every week, but one week might have dogs and rabbits (preditor/prey) etc...if you want to autocreate, you'll have to have alot of roles

Matthias Miller 03/22/2023: Order entry is one step of the process, and then it goes over to the logistics team to schedule.

Matthias Miller 03/22/2023: DONE_MM - split apart the transport information from the order information
