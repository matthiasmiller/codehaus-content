Requirements

The Solution can store prices as needed for dogs, pigs, and feed items. This is a way to keep track of the pricing format for each customer and apply that to animals/orders. 

  


The details of how and where these prices will be set/stored is to be determined in in-depth design.

Development Specification

DONE_JB: Ben Reitz 04/03/2023: Is this just for kg conversions? If so, can we tie weight conversions into the order? Do you have other reasons for custom pricing for customers?

Ben Reitz 04/04/2023: 90% of the customers deal in kilograms, the rest deal in pounds. Oak Hill deals 100% in pounds internally. The conversions can be tied to the order. Oak Hill has a few customers that have specific pricing based on volume, but the majority are billed off of the yearly price sheet.
