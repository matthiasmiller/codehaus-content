5.2. Contact Record

The Solution will use the standard AppHosting Contacts module, with some customizations. 

  


This will include standard features, such as: 

  * First Name & Last Name or Business Name
  * Addresses
  * Phone (can include multiple) 
  * Email 



  


This will also include custom fields, such as: 

  * For employees:
    * Employee Initials (must be unique across all active employees)
    * Location (linked with a way to control what location the user can view in the software)
    * Driver (checkbox)



  


  * For customers:
    * License # (visible if Contact Type = Customer)
    * QuickBooks Customer (visible if Contact Type = Customer; syncs with QuickBooks to link the contact)



  


Note: There is the option to set multiple addresses, including Bill To, Ship To, etc.
