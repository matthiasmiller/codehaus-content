16.2. Changes to Animal Record

  


Requirements

The following items can be added when the "main system" is designed and built: 

  


  * Reports section:
    * Breeder Performance (link to template
    * Rabies Certificate (link to template)
    * Dog History Report (link to template)



  


Notes about Rabies Certificate, Dog History Report: These are file reports that are sent with the dog when they are delivered. But they rarely use the individual ones on the dog record. Generally they are batch printed from the order for all animals in the order. But sometimes they would want to be able to print out an individual form for one animal (like if there's a last-minute change and they don't want to reprint the whole order).

  


Development Specification

TODO_IDD: Tim Reitz 04/03/2023: The Animal record would need to be a custom database level rather than a lookup record, due to the high number of Pig-type records and the high number of pig entries at a time. 

  


TODO_IDD:

[ ] Determine which items are lists, and if so, of what

[ ] Consider how to field employee initials

  


TODO_IDD: Standardize use of term Canine vs Dog (and use of term Pig)

Ben Reitz 04/04/2023: Canine and Porcine
