17.12. Trip Report

  


Requirements

This report provides scheduling tools for trips.

  


High-Level Scheduling View:

  * List of orders that do not have a task assigned to them, but need one. Easy way to assign them
  * List of transport tasks based on schedule and/or status.
  * At some point (future phase), consider a row-style scheduling view that shows the driver and vehicle availability. For example, the vehicle will be available immediately after return. However, the driver has a required rest period.



  


In the current software, the user can select a Start Date and End Date and runs the report that shows the following for the selected date range: 

  * Available Drivers 
  * Available Vehicles
  * Scheduled Drivers 
  * Schedules Vehicles 
  * Option to mark a Driver and/or Vehicle as unavailable for a selected date 



  


In the current software, this is a fairly basic feature. Oak Hill would like to improve usability and functionality of the feature. 

  


The Solution would have the ability to create a Trip for a selected Driver and Vehicle and one or more Orders. This probably would start as a fairly basic feature, and could be customized in the future to track mileage, add photos to the Trip, track details about the cargo area and animals, etc. 

  


The Solution would have a Dispatch report to show the trips and available Drivers and Vehicles for a selected date range. There would also be the ability to filter by location or show all locations together.
