1\. Overview

  


Requirements

Cussewago Truss currently uses Eagle Metal's management solution. This solution does not provide any scheduling system or inventory tracking. Eagle is in the process of rewriting the solution to provide those capabilities, but they don't have a specific time line for that.

  


We will provide an integrated system that will provide the scheduling and inventory tracking required.

Matthias Miller 02/28/2020: We discussed some possibilities for a Phase 2. These ideas include:

  * Splitting production schedules apart from team.
  * Adding low stock warnings for inventory.
  * Handling inventory of odd pieces.



Adding price optimization for odd pieces based on cost.
