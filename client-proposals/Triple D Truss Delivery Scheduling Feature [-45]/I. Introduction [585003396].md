1\. Introduction

  


Requirements

Triple D Truss is looking to digitize their production tracking and delivery scheduling:

  * Tracking the delivery target date. Build completion should be marked before delivery day. The dispatcher could see which orders aren't complete and check with production to see what's going on. 
  * This would be tracking board feet for the week. Rescheduling a delivery from one day to the next would change the board feet numbers for the day and for the week. 
  * They currently use a big whiteboard with order tracker magnets (check off items manually). They can pull off a magnet and move it to another day if needed. It's a really simple system; they'd like keep the simplicity of the system and take it digital. 
  * They're currently tracking board feet manually as well. 
  * This is for in-house use.
  * This is in the same database as the current order management/inventory management system, but but they are not sharing information.
