4\. Phase 3: Overview - Email and SMS Marketing

  


Requirements

The goal of Phase 3 is to create a long-term marketing and fundraising strategy with donors and guests. Our plan is to integrate into a full-featured marketing CRM to manage email and SMS marketing campaigns.

  


Based on advice from Stephen, we are allowed to send a single SMS message to a phone number inviting them to opt into another list. (For example, get a $5 coupon when you sign up.) We can do something similar with our email addresses. This allows us to collect names, emails, and phone numbers without needing to specifically ask people to opt into marketing now.

  


We do not currently plan to have a SMS checkin kiosk. Instead, this will be integrated into the point of sale.

  


We also do not have any method of collecting information from people who drop off donations at the back door. However, this is not highly urgent because the highest quality donations come from pickup and delivery.

  


Because donors and guests are often different clientele, we likely do not need integration between the POS and the pickup and delivery system.
