3.23. Electronic Donation Receipts

We will add support for Electronic Donation receipts. Add "Electronic" as a list option to Donation Receipt on the stop detail. When selected, require an email address for the guest.

  


If the guest has selected Electronic as their receipt preference, when the stop is fulfilled, send an email to the guest's email address with a Reply-To set to the Thrift Store email address. The subject and email contents will be user-configurable in the AppHosting.zone settings.
