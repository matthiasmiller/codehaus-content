3.28. Online Scheduling Approval

When an online Schedule Request is received, it will send an email to a Contact (specified on the AppHosting.zone settings), with a "Reply To" set to return to the guest.

  


To decline the request, reply to that email with an explanation.

  


The email will include a link to approve the request. Clicking the link will guide the user through the normal process of creating a new stop, but defaulting all the values based on the submitted form.
