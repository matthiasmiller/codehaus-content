2.4.1. Weekdays

The weekdays would be an embedded spreadsheet of:

Weekday| Start Location| End Location| Default Start Time  
---|---|---|---  
Monday| Canon TS| Canon TS|   
  
Tuesday| Pueblo TS| Pueblo TS|   
  
Etc|   
|   
|   
  
  
  


The Default Stop Length has been moved to the Stop Types.

  


For Phase 1, we will remove the maximum number of stops. This will be re-implemented as a Default End Time in Phase 2.
