Development Specification

Matthias Miller 09/03/2020: On our end, we'll keep an outline of the walkthrough, and we'll have the customer service check-in see who's in charge of scheduling. If changes, set up a time with the new individual to do the walkthrough. Alternatively, I'd love if the help system would have an LMS.
