3.13. SMS - Thank You Message

If a guest has opted into text message notifications, send a thank you message after a stop has been completed.

  


The text message can be customized but would default to:

"Thank you for your donation, [FirstName]. Click on this link to leave a 10-second review: <link>"

  


To avoid lengthy text messages, we recommend buying a short domain such as nhts.co or nhts.link and configuring it to redirect to our provided web page.

  


The link would take them to the Guest Satisfaction Survey (described below).
