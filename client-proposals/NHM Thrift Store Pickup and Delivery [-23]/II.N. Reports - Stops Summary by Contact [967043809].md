Requirements

The Stops by Contact report should count the number of fulfilled stops, showing the following columns:

  * Name
  * Address
  * City
  * State
  * Zip
  * # of Stops (only fulfilled stops)



  


Add a prompt for Minimum Number of Stops. Default to 2.

  


We will add additional filters/prompts to this report in Phase 2.

  


Development Specification

[ ] Totals only report - no ask prompts needed

[ ] May need a model on this one -- to exclude Contacts who've only had X number of stops.
