Want to be able to bring multiple RTO companies in to work with them.

  


One of the roadblocks is that RTO has criteria and needs -- biggest one is their capital constraints

  * Parameters that an RTO company has
  * Gabe is particular that when a customer does an RTO contract, wherever the critiera takes it, that contract needs to print out at that point (based on location, style of building, etc)



  


Decides to use the right RTO company.

  


They'd like to take X% of contracts per year, and you distribute it based on the distribution...

  


Based on some of the criteria -- some of it would REQUIRED and could only be changed by special circumstances (types of RTO contract lengths)

  


  


What's the diference between RIGHTS vs PREFERENCES

* Flexibility for a smaller size company or who doesn't want to work in a particular state...

  


  


Credit card portals, etc...

  


Preference for keeping them in the company...

  


  


Historical data

  * What is the price point of buildings



  


Spreadsheet worth of buildings for 2020

  * Size
  * Style 
  * Price



  


Start taking actual ShedsDirect contracts to actually be enough...to grow these companies enough that they can handle it as they go...

  * One RTO has expanded into line of credit, and into 



  


  


What are the factors:

  * High Risk
    * When you cross the $6K threshhold, it goes to longer length contracts to keep the RTO payment in the $180-250/mo
    * The bigger building you want, they start looking for longer contracts, to stay within a permonth payment amount.
    * The longer the contract and the longer the payment value. you don't receive much upfront payment.
  * Shorter contracts (24 contracts)
    * Smaller size contracts...
    * Don't make as much money
    * But the person has a mental frame to pay things off as fast as they can
  * YTD % of Process



  


  


[ ] State Requirements

  


  * Risk is determined by length of contract
  * Certain states can be higher risk



  


  


[ ] As an RTO company, they'd like that to be distributed across a year's time frame.
