3.2. Shop Details

  


Requirements

We will have a large screen monitor in the shop. It will show the Schedule Report, except with the assignee in the first column (instead of a grouping) to preserve vertical space. The report would only show jobs for the next week.

  


In addition, we will have either tablets or SMS integration. We will pursue pricing for locked-down tablets.

Matthias Miller 02/06/2020: probably about eye level where they can take a look at...same as scheduling but with the assignee in a column,...

  * Matthias Miller 02/06/2020: Should the follow up date??
  * Matthias Miller 02/06/2020: The only follow-up that he needs is when it gets marked as completed, there's a notifaction that the owner needs to be notified.
    * When it's complete, move it to a Billing stage, with a follow-up date of today, change assignee to you, and ....I'll take a look to see what it would take ?? SMS would be better
