6.1. Overview

These changes are a reduced-scope version of the previously-designed Phase 3a.

  


The main focus of these changes is to do the following: 

  * Allow users to be assigned to and track time on child incidents without the child incidents being displayed on the schedule (unless the Assignee on the child is different from the Assignee on the parent, in which case it will display separately on the Schedule). 
  * Add various fields / data points to Work Orders.
