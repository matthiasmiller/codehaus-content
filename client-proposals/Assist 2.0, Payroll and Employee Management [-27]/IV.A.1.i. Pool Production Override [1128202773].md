4.1.1.9. Pool Production Override

Each company will default to using pool compensation. However, this can be overridden on a per week basis. The company will have a "13-Week Average Compensation" section that will include an embedded spreadsheet of:

  


  * Start of Week (date)
  * End of Week (read-only; automatically calculated)
  * 13-Week Average (read-only; automatically calculated)
  * Pool Production Override (number)



  


This is used to compensate employees when the shop is open for non-production:

  * The shop is closed and everyone is working but no production is generated. In this scenario, we want to pay employees based on the individual's average of the last 13 weeks.
  * The shop is closed but production is generated (building their own sales or lot buildings).



  


This will NOT affect lead times.
