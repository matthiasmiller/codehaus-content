6.1. Tracking Building Labor Costs

  


Requirements

To track profitability, Assist will start tracking the labor costs of each building. The goal is to create benchmarks, not provide fully accurate numbers. (This is not used for compensation.)

  


This can be done in one of two ways:

  


Tracking by Station: Tracking the number of people and hours each station spends on the building (one time sheet per station). Multiply these by a calculated hourly rate.

  


Tracking by Employee: Tracking the number of hours each person spends on the building (one time sheet per building). Multiply these by a calculated hourly rate.

  


To start with, Assist will track the information and provide only minimal reporting. The profitability reporting will be handled in the "Reporting / Dashboard" module.
