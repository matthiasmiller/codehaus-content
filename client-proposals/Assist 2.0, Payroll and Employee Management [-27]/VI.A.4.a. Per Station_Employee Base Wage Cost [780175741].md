6.1.4.1. Per Station/Employee Base Wage Cost

  


Requirements

Overtime-Adjusted Hourly Wage. When calculating labor costs, overtime needs to be spread across the entire week.

  


For example, if an employee gets paid $15/hour and works 50 hours, they will receive $15/hr for the first 40 hours ($600), and $22.50 for the next 10 hours ($225), resulting in a paycheck of $825.

  


When divided across the entire week (50 hours), this results in a $16.50/hr overtime-adjusted hourly wage.

  


Total Daily Production Base Wages. The base wages are calculated by multiplying each employee's production hours (indicated by the Production checkbox on their time card record) and their overtime-adjusted hourly wage.

  


Building Hourly Base Rate (date-specific). To calculate the cost per man hour, divide the Total Daily Production Base Wages for the day by the total number of station/employee building hours for the day.

  


Station/Employee Base Wage Cost. The base labor cost is calculated by taking multiplying the time slot duration, the number of people, and the Building Hourly Base Rate.
