5.1. 13-Week Average

Employees are sometimes paid on a 13-week average to avoid dropping their wages when they're not directly contributing to production. This happens in two scenarios:

  * When they are taking paid time off
  * When the shop is open for non-production (resetting the shop, etc)



  


In this case, the hourly rate will be calculated from the prior 13 week average.
