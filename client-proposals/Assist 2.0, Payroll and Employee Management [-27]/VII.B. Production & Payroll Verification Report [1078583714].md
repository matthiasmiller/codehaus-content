7.2. Production & Payroll Verification Report

  


Requirements

Every week, Assist will provide a PDF for each company detailing the compensation information for the prior week. Each company will verify the payroll information every week, even if the company is on a biweekly or monthy pay period. This is required to provide weekly profitability numbers, and it allows Burkholder Management to correct problems as soon as they are found.

  


The goal of this report is to provide a stop gap for production and payroll numbers. Additional reporting will be available in the Reporting & Dashboard module.

  


Note that even though ABC 1 and ABC 2 are currently in the same spreadsheet, they would now generate completely separate reports.

  


It's important to maintain precision when calculating the wages. For example, the Excel spreadsheet rounded the number of hours to two decimal places, which resulted in differences between the paystub and the Excel spreadsheet. If Assist simply maintains precision, it can match these numbers.

  


Each of these reports will include the company name in a bold heading in the header.

  


Development Specification

Nate Kilcrease 01/15/2021: Similar to the Owner Verification Report, would this open after a prompt for a Company name, or is it a split report (left-pane, right-pane)?

Matthias Miller 01/15/2021: No mockup needed.

  


NOTE: This should be pushed towards the end of the build, and it wouldn't hurt to reach out to Mark or Duane to see if there have been any adjustments to what this report is. We told them we could go ahead and start on development but wait for final edits to the report.

  


Before implementing this, make sure we've gotten the final versions from Affordable Barns.
