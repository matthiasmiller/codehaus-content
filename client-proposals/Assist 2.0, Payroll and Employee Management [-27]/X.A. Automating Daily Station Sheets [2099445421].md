10.1. Automating Daily Station Sheets

We discussed sending daily station sheets to simplify data entry. This could send a daily page with invoices from the BPR for a (customizable) time frame. However, this has a few significant limitations:

  


  * It requires coordination to make sure that the right sheets get to production with the right date.
  * It increases the likelihood of error from the production side. Handwriting the invoice number reduces the likelihood of error, versus trying to find the correct row on a sheet.



  


If it makes sense to automate this in the future, we can revisit this.
