4.1.1.3. Recurring 1099 Payouts

  


Requirements

Owner expenses of child companies (e.g. loan payments, rent, etc). are paid out of the configured owner pool. Assist will track this to provide owner payroll, as well as make it able to compare the profitability of Parent vs Child Companies. The exact reporting will be developed in a separate module.

  


The Company record will define a set of Recurring 1099 Payouts in an embedded spreadsheet. This is used to define the schedule of these payouts. For example:

Payee| Type| Amount| Pay Week| Description  
---|---|---|---|---  
Required Text Field| Required; User-Defined List| Required| Required. Choice of First, Second, Third, Fourth, Last, All| Optional Text Field  
  
  


This should include Move Up and Move Down buttons to control the order in the spreadsheet.
