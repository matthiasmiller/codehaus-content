6.1.4. Calculating Labor Costs

Building-specific labor costs are calculated by:

  * The total base wages paid for production (including)
  * The standard production bonus (7.5% minus base wages)
  * The labor-intensive production bonus



  


Labor costs will be calculated on a per-day basis. This increases the accuracy of the calculations for non-production work days (shop resets, etc).

  


The building's base wage costs are calculated from the station/employee time entries for the building. These calculations are detailed below.

  


The bonuses are calculated and stored on the building (see above).
