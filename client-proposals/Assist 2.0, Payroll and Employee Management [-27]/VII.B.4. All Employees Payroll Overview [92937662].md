7.2.4. All Employees Payroll Overview

  


Requirements

This report will also provide an overview of the payroll for all employees/owners. It will include a row for each employee, as well as a total row.

  


If any time cards were missed in the entry process, these employees would still show up in this report. These may be noted in the Exceptions sections. While Burkholder Management may notice these, the builder will ultimately be responsible for flagging them and reporting the correct data.

  


For example:

Date| Hourly Rate / Weekly Salary*| PTO Hours| Total Hours| Reg $| OT $| PTO $If company uses PTO| Production Bonuses $| Extra Bonus| General  Bonus| Work Orders| Total Pay
