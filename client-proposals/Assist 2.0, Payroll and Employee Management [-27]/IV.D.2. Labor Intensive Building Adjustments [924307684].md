4.4.2. Labor Intensive Building Adjustments

As soon as a building is marked as completed, Assist will calculate and store the labor intensive building adjustment. (This is used for dog kennels, etc.)

  


Because Assist stores the calculated value as soon as the building is completed, it will only need to store the current calculation method. This also allows these numbers to be adjusted on the building (for example, to accommodate builders who do not have a standardized on-site bonus calculation).

  


This amount will be added to the bonus pool and will be distributed across all employees working that week. It will also be included in the labor cost.

  


This will be an embedded spreadsheet such as:

Reason| Adjustment Amount  
---|---  
Same list as the Automatic Building-Specific Production Pool Adjustment|   
  
  
  


These amounts can be manually adjusted until the production totals have been frozen for the week. On-site bonuses can either be configured automatically, or they can be entered manually on a per-building basis.
