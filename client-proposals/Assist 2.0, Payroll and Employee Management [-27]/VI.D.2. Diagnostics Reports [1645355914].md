6.4.2. Diagnostics Reports

  


Requirements

Assist will include special diagnostic reports to show exactly how each of the reports and totals are calculated. This will provide transparency into the calculations.

  


Development Specification

Nate Kilcrease 01/15/2021: What are the final details for this report? Should there be a separate diagnostic report for every other report (Owner Payroll, Production Payroll, etc.)?

Matthias Miller 01/15/2021: No mockup required.

  


Matthias Miller 01/15/2021: Ellis, we didn't spec this out because the calculations kept changing. I'd like to have a report (or set of reports) that shows the inner workings of the calculations for testing and for proof of accurate calculations. Bury them in the Advanced section.
