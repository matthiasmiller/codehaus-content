The Production & Payroll Verification Report will include a page for each individual hourly employee.

  


It would include:

  * Week Number
  * Date Range
  * Vacation Period Start/End Date (if using vacation)



  


It would include a table with the daily breakdown, such as:

The report will not include vacation hours and vacation remaining if the company does not use vacation tracking (i.e. the vacation settings are left blank).

  


The Individual Employee Summary will NOT include the individual employee KPIs from the previous payroll spreadsheets. If these KPIs are still required, this will require separate weekly 1-sheet KPI summary report.

  


Development Specification

Nate Kilcrease 01/15/2021: If we are displaying both of these RGs for every hourly employee, how would we arrange all of them? For a large company, this would require pages of tables.

NOTE: Technically, Vacation could be calculated as all non-Holiday PTO.
