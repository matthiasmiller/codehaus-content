5.4. Guaranteed Wage

Assist will include an option to add the Guaranteed Wage before generating the verification report. This is used for new shops that want to attract skilled foremen, as well as some shops that provide this on an ongoing basis.

  


Calculate the guaranteed wage for the entire week by multiplying the hours by the hourly guaranteed wage, without overtime calculation.

  


Calculate the comparison wages using the total hourly wages paid, including overtime, paid time off, production bonus, and other bonuses.

  


Add a "General Bonus" to the time card to make up the difference (if any). When calculating this, be sure to remove any existing General Bonus items before calculating and adding the updated bonus.

  


Note that work orders will be removed from the guaranteed wage. This means that a work order may cause the wage to drop below the guaranteed wage.
