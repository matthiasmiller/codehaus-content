6.4.1. Missing Buildings Report

  


Requirements

Assist will check for completed buildings that are missing stations, using the same method described in the Exceptions section of the Production & Payroll Verification Report.

  


If any such buildings exist for the prior week, Assist will email a report to Burkholder Management on Monday morning. Burkholder Management will be responsible for verifying these buildings. No email will be sent if no such buildings exist.

  


This report will also appear as a red alert on the sidebar and menu. This alert will disappear after it's been viewed.
