4.1.1.4. Historical 1099 Payouts

The company record will also define a set of Historical 1099 Payouts. This will be used to track actual payouts (and adjust, if necessary) on a week-by-week basis. For example:

Payee| Type| Amount| Date| Description| Pending  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Required Text Field| Required; User-Defined List| Required| Required. Start Date of Pay Period.| Optional Text Field| [X]  
  
  


The row is editable while the payout is pending. After payroll is finalized, the pending checkbox becomes checked and the row becomes read-only. Edits to the row can be made by temporarily unchecking the checkbox, making the changes, and checking it again. This only affects payroll reports, not profitability reports.

  


Every week, Assist will automatically copy the recurring owner expenses to the owner expense history. This will be set up as a scheduled task every Sunday evening.
