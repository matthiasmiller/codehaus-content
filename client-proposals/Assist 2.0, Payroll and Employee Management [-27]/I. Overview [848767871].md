1\. Overview

  


Requirements

InSight 2020 would like to extend the current AppHosting solution “Assist” to be a full-featured ERP. This is a large project and will be broken into pieces to simplify design and development, and increase the likelihood of a successful roll-out.

  


This proposal will provide Payroll and Employee Management (called Module 2). This adds time tracking features such as time cards and station tracking, which will be used for calculating payroll and labor costs. It also provides an automated Production & Payroll Verification Report.

  


Module 2 will allow you to start tracking the labor costs associated with buildings, laying the foundation for the dashboard reports covered in Module 3.

  


This proposal uses the term "parent company" to refer to "main shops" and the term "child company" to refer to "sub shops".
