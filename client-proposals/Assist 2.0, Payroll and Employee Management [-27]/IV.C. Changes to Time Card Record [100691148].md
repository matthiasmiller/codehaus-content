4.3. Changes to Time Card Record

  


Requirements

Only hourly employees or salaried employees with an hourly equivalent will track their hours. However, because time card records include weekly discretionary bonuses, all employees will have time card records in Assist.

  


Employee time cards will be faxed in, and the entry process should be as efficient as possible.

  


Assist will provide a report that will prompt for Company and Date, defaulting to the prior week.

  


The report will be split into two panes:

  * The left pane will show a list of employees for that time period, allowing a specific employee to be selected.
  * The right pane will show the time card for the selected employee.



  


The left pane will show the effective hours for each employee, making it easy to see if an employee was missed from the time cards. It will automatically update when the time card is saved on the right.

  


Time cards will open in the right pane, which will be used for the majority of the data entry (time worked, paid time off, and bonuses). To make entry more efficient, Assist will automatically populate each Time Card with the days of the week, as demonstrated in the following sections.

  


Development Specification

Use a live updating report for the left pane. Use an auto-push into the detail screen for the right pane.

  


Nate Kilcrease 12/31/2020: What is the screen size? Should all the sections be in one column, or is there space for two?
