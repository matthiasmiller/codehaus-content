I also think it would be helpful for us to create an "EVENT LIST” which would be a list that shows us each EVENT that will hit the Financials. We would then need to figure out how we will handle each EVENT in Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3, as these EVENTS will all need to be handled in one way or another. Here is a quick list to get started. I am sure that I am missing some of them:

  


  


  * For an asset account, Debit is a PLUS, and Credit is a MINUS



  


  


  * a. PO Placed For Raw Materials
    * Will affect cash flow projection, but does not affect P&L + Balance Sheet
  * b. Raw Materials Arrive
    * Debit Raw Materials
    * Credit Accounts Payable
  * c. Raw Materials Invoice Arrives
    * No Event, although it's typically paid right away
  * d. Raw Materials Invoice Is Paid
    * Debit Accounts Payable
    * Credit Checking
  * e. Raw Materials Are Consumed To Build A Shed
    *   * f. A Shed Order Is Placed
    * No Change
  * Downpayment Is Made
    * Debit Checking
    * Credit "Downpayments" Liability
    * NOTE: No sales tax here, given that the building has not been paid
  * g. A Shed Is Built
    *   * h. A Shed Is Delivered
    *   * i. A Shed Is Paid
  * j. A Non Shed Order Is Placed
  * k. A Non Shed Order Is Delivered
  * l. A Non Shed Order Is Paid
  * m. Raw Materials Inventory Count / Adjustment
  * n. Finished Goods Inventory Count / Adjustment



  


  * Exceptions
    * Cancellation
    * Repo



  


  


  


Transfer of ownership happens when the shed is delivered
