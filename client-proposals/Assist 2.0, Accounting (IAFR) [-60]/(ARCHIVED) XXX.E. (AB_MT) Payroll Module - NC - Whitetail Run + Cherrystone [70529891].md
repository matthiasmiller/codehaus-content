30.5. (AB/MT) Payroll Module - NC - Whitetail Run + Cherrystone

Matthias Miller 08/10/2023: 

  


  * Aaron changes time cards to X out the Prod hours, and they would submit them as Non-Prod Hours



  


  * Move Whitetail run employees over to non-production
  * Manually calculate bonuses and add them to the time card



  


\Matthias Miller 08/11/2023: Marking as resolved, since it's not in my court and we can handle it without coding.
