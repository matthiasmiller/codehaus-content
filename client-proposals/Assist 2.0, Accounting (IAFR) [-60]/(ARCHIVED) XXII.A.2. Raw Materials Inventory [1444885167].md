22.0.2. Raw Materials Inventory

Raw Materials inventory is tracked in Assist and entered into QuickBooks weekly. The total is incremented in real-time as new product is received. However, it does not decrement in real-time because BOM support has not been implemented.

  


A manual Raw Materials inventory is done at the end of the month. The 50 highest-ticket items are counted, and the rest of the items are estimated. These are then entered into Assist as an inventory adjustment.
