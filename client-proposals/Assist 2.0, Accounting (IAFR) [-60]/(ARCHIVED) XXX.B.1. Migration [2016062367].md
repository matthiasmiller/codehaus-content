30.2.1. Migration

Matthias Miller 08/01/2023: This is no longer needed.

  


We will provide an import that takes:

  * STIN
  * Raw Material $
  * Production Labor $
  * Production Overhead $



  


It will import this into the new fields for FGI costs.

  


Mark will work with Nic on an export for all buildings in FGI, then will come up with the appropriate numbers for the breakdown that will be imported.

  


  * The manufacturer number will stay the same.
  * The migration will import new numbers for the material, production labor, and production overhead.
  * The finished goods cost will shift to the new values provided.
