26.0.0.1. FGI Cost Items

Matthias Miller 11/07/2022: Per discussion with the client, we no longer need this.

  


Each FGI Cost Category will have one or more sub-items. For example, within Production Overhead, Assist will track additional items such as:

  * Delivery Expense
  * Repairs & Maintenance
  * Shop Supplies
  * Machinery & Equipment
  * Utilities



  


These items will be configured as FGI Cost Items.

  


Add a list of FGI Cost Items:

  * Name (text)
  * Category (required; list of FGI Cost Categories)



  


This list will be controllable by administrators, allowing these to broken down into any number of categories.
