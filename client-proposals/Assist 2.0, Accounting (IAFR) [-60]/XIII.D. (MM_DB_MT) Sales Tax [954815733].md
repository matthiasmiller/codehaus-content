13.4. (MM/DB/MT) Sales Tax

InSight is currently using TaxJar. It calculates it automatically for the initial sale, but it doesn't make corrections for cancelations, change orders, etc.

  


At the end of the quarter, they want to see what they paid sales on, and what they didn't pay sales tax on, based on changes that occurred.

  


TODO - Make sure Duane is onboard with this.

Matthias Miller 08/09/2023: We do not have reports on Sales Orders that are not tied to a building, and we have no way to trigger it based on a sales order that does not have a building (i.e. sold some ramps)
