1\. Overview

InSight would like to have better visibility into their financials. They would like to have a workable accounting software within Assist by January 1, 2023.

  


  * The biggest reason is the shed industry is getting ready to experience the squeeze that has been anticipated since COVID started. Probably 30% of the shed businesses are either going to go out of business or consolidate with other shed businesses. Having a good grip on their numbers is going to be critical. They are wanting to move to double-entry/accrual accounting, and it's cost-prohibitive to do it manually.
  * The second reason is that the systems are disconnected. Everything needs to be manually brought from one system to the other. It makes it hard to be accurate, and it can't be real-time.
  * The more they improve and advance, the more discontent they become with the solutions they have.



  


The ideal sequence would go:

  * Figure out exactly what they want in the end, including the toe-wiggling
  * Go through there and pick the parts of how long something takes to put in place, and pick what needs to be done for things to be in place
  * Put that in place
  * Implement the basic system
  * If they missed Jan 1 date by a number of weeks, they'd back-enter information.
  * Start working on the next steps to toe-wiggly.



  


There are two sets of changes:

  * Updating the P&L and Balance sheet to reflect classes and GL accounts, using double-entry and recognizing expenses and income when they are realized
  * Migrating to and integrating with the AppHosting accounting module



  


This will require QuickBooks to be run along-side the AppHosting accounting module. QuickBooks will be discontinued at whatever point we're comfortable fully making the switch to the AppHosting module.
