23.1. Sales

i. One of the principles of accrual accounting is that sales, income, or revenue needs to be recorded when it is earned regardless of when payment in received. According to GAAP, a sale takes place when possession is transferred.

  


ii. In our businesses this is when the transfer of ownership takes place, which is when the shed is delivered to the customer and is a 1-time event. This is also how sales tax reporting is being done within ASSIST.

  


  * A variation of this 'when the transfer of ownership takes place' will be for wholesale sales where they pick up their own building with Net 30 terms. Will this trigger point be when they pick up their building?



  


  * Another variation of this 'when the transfer of ownership takes place' will be for Cash and Carry items where the customer picks up a ramp or window, etc.



  


iii. Currently we are recording sales at the point we deposit money into our accounts.

  


iv. This change will also affect our Accounts Receivable process.
