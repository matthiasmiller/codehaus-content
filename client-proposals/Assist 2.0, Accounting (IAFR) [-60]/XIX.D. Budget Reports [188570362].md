19.4. Budget Reports

  


Requirements

The budget reports include:

  * Budget vs Actual
    * Month Budget
    * Month Actual
    * Month Difference
    * YTD Budget
    * YTD Actual
    * YTD Difference



  


This could be filtered down to a single class, or it could generate a multi-page report with one for each report.

  


  


  * Report of *just* the budget would be nice if it is not difficult but this is not a  "have to"
    * Budget Detail with Months  Across the Year
    * TODO_CCI
