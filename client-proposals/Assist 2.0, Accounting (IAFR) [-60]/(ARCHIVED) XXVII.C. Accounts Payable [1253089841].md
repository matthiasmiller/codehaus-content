27.3. Accounts Payable

i. We are currently doing this within ASSIST, for ABC and ST and will proceed to do this for VS after implementing IMS in their district.

  


ii. See the attached report for ABC.

  


ili. How will we tie this into the Accounting Software? 

  


TODO_CH - See Vendor Invoices, as well as [https://insite.apphosting.zone/Reports/User/Shared/Accounts_Payable/Verification_Report-3](https://insite.apphosting.zone/Reports/User/Shared/Accounts_Payable/Verification_Report-3)

  


  


Currently have PO, confirmation of receipt, Vendor Invoice matched up to this--above report goes to person responsible for it in the district--once it's verified that the product was recived and the Vendor Invoice matches the PO amount, then it gets sent to Whitney and puts it into QB. (This does involve ACH transactions.)

  * Because this is being done manually, this can probably pushed off.
