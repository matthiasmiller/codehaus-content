3.2.3.2. Credit Card Fees

  


Requirements

On Sales Orders, add a Fee column to the payments (number with 2 decimals). This will automatically be populated from Stripe or the current credit card processor.

  


It should be editable outside of the detail screen or when the user has permission to edit accounting data.
