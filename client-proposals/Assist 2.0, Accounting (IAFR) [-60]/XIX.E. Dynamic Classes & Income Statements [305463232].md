19.5. Dynamic Classes & Income Statements

Matthias Miller 07/26/2023: We will want to do something like this -- but it won't be a specific class. It will be some kind of custom criteria that can be configured.

  


Sometimes want to split up:

  * equally
  * based on an arbitrary amount
  * based on an arbitrary percentage
  * based on % of sales
  * based on # of income transactions



  


We don't have to do all of these at once -- we can prioritize appropriately.
