20.0.1. Inventory - Labor/Overhead Ratios

Every time payroll is run, Assist will calculate and store two numbers:

  


  * FGI Labor Expense % = "Finished Goods Inventory - Production Labor" asset balance / "Buildings Sales Order Price" for all finished goods
  * FGI Overhead Expense % = "Finished Goods Inventory - Production Overhead" asset balance / "Buildings Sales Order Price" for all finished goods



  


FGI Materials Expense % is calculated as the remaining balance %.

  


These values will be used when expensing out sold items.
