30.4.0.2. Reconciliation witH AP / PO's

Matthias Miller 08/10/2023: This is not needed. The current process works well.

  


  * PO w/ multiple vendor invoices?
    * Don't think so, and if so, why not just break apart the original PO
  * You don't always have a PO for a vendor invoice
    * No -- but these will be handled through a GL entry, not through the AP module (?????)
    * We might get an invoice for something w/o a purchase order, but before we pay it $5K invoice, we want the district manager to sign off on it, and to be cleared to pay.
    * The other part is visibility into CC receipts, and handwritten checks at the office -- those have already been paid, and a manager can't say he doesn't want to pay it. But he can confirm that it has the right account name



  


  * TODO - Prepayment on PO
    * 


  


  * PO
    * Issued - 
      * No impact w/o prepayment
    * Prepayment
      * Entry on balance sheet
    * Received - 
      * Inventory has increased
    * Paid - 
  * Checking has decreased
