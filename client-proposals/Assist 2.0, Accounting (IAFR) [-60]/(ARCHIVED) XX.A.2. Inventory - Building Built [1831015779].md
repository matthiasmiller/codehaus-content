20.0.2. Inventory - Building Built

  


Requirements

Whenever a building is built, the Accounting system will create an automatic transfer for Raw Materials:

  * Credit the "Raw Materials" asset account based on the building's FGI Materials numbers
  * Debit the "Finished Goods Inventory - Materials" based on the same number



  


The accounting transaction would be created automatically and would be linked to the building.

  


Development Specification

TODO_JN:

  * We'll want to start storing the Raw Materials vs Labor portion of the FGI inventory.
