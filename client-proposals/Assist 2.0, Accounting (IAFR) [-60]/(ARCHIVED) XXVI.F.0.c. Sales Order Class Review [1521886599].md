26.6.0.3. Sales Order Class Review

The Sales Order Class Review report is used to review class assignments.

  


Prompt for:

  * Date Range
  * District (list of districts)



  


Columns:

  * Invoice #
  * Description (including STIN)
  * Total Sale (without sales tax)
  * Materials
  * Production Labor
  * Production Overhead
  * Class
  * Blank column called "Change Class"



  


This would include all sales orders for the specified date range.

  


Once this is live, we'll need to set up automated reports to send this out to the appropriate district managers.
