3.2.6.6. Custom Buildings

Custom buildings have different costs from standard buildings. This requires two things:

  


  * Actual building costs should be weighted by Standard Cost $, not by Manufacturer Total. (Already updated in the Actual Building Costing section.)
  * The builders need to notify Burkholder Management whenever a different Standard Cost % is required.



  


Since we have not implemented BOM Rules, this requires no functional changes.
