19.1. (DB) Income Statement Comparison Reports

It would be nice to allow a Comparison report as well, with options for:

  * Prior Period
  * Prior Year



  


When selected, this would show columns for:

  * Prior Period/Year
  * Current Period/Year
  * Difference



  


This would be available for a single class, or for all classes, but not multiple classes.

  


Matthias Miller 08/01/2023: Consider a Repeat for Column report for comparisons.

  


  * Rather than implement standard classes, the accounting system will include dynamic classes or reports, based on dealer, building style, color, specific set of options, date of sale, sale amount, etc.
