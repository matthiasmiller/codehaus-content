Requirements

Contacts will have the following Contact Types:

  * Customers
    * The customer-type contact will have a "Special Order Requirements" notes memo. This would be used to document special, client-specific instructions that will be included automatically on all orders and cut lists for that customer.
    * The customer-type contact will have a Tax Item linked to the QuickBooks tax items.
    * The customer-type contact will have a custom "Orders" section that lists all quotes and orders for that customer. 
  * Employees
