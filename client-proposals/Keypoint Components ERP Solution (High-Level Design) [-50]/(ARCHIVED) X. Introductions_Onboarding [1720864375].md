Matthias Miller 03/10/2022:

  * Biggest fear is not only spending the money, but also all the time that it's going to take, and that's all good -- as long as we end up with something that's better and faster that they have.
  * Didn't come up with anything different than what he's shown us so far.

Matthias Miller 03/10/2022: They've been through several DISC seminars, and have had a DISC seminar here, and they pull all of them through DISC when they start here. This intrigues him, because it's somewhat like DISC, but a different level of it.

  


  


"Housekeeping items": 

[X] Does Client want call summaries on a Google Doc?

[ ] If yes, the CSS or Design Assistant should share it with the group

Matthias Miller 03/10/2022: Don't need.

 

Project name/subdomain: 

[X] Determine the project name/subdomain (helpful for shorthand reference in the design phase; possibly used the same for reference longer-term)

  * We like to have an internal name to refer to the project. Choosing this name does not signify any commitment from either side. For consistency, we like to use the website address where your software solution would be hosting. The format is something.apphosting.zone. We're looking for something that is short, unique, memorable, and relevant. Many time this is a part of your business name or an abbreviation. Sometimes it is a name that you chose to assign to the software solution.
  * Is there an abbreviation they already use? 
  * Share suggestions prepared as options or conversation starters: 
    * (see HL Design incident)
  * Settled on: 
    * Project name/nickname: 
      * Keypoint
      * KPC
      * KC
      * Key
      * KeyCentral
      * KeypointCentral
    * 3LC: 
      * ZKP



Tim Reitz 03/15/2022: DONE_CCI: Is this one available?

  * ZKC
  *   * 

  * Subdomain: 
    * keypoint.apphosting
    * keycentral.apphosting



  


Matthias Miller 03/10/2022: Keypoint is used the most. That would be fine with him.
