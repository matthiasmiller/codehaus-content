6.2. All Orders Report

  


Requirements

This report would include orders in all stages, with filters for things such as: 

  * Stage
  * Customer
  * Date Range
  * etc.



  


This would include columns for:

  * Projected Start Date
  * Needed By Date



  


The Projected Start Date could show in Red if it's past the Needed By Date, in orange if it's within a certain number of the Needed By Date, and black if it's before that. This can be determined in the in-depth design.

  


The report title will show the Next Available Start Date.
