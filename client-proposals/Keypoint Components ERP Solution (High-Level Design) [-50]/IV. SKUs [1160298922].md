4\. SKUs

The Solution would include AppHosting's Inventory Management module, with some customizations.

  


SKUs would be used to track the various materials, sales items, and options.

  


Sales Items would be synced with QuickBooks (see more details in the corresponding section of this proposal).

  


The Solution would use SKU Categories such as: 

  * Box Wood
    * Custom Fields:
      * Thickness (number; 2 decimals)
  * Bottom Wood
    * Custom Fields:
      * Thickness (number; 2 decimals)
  * Components
    * Item Cost (number with 2 decimals)
    * Custom Fields:
      * Setup Cost (number with 2 decimals)
  * Drawer Combinations
    * Names:
      * Double Silverware
      * Etc
    * Price
    * Custom Fields: (need an option to require finish; and need to specify additional options)
      * Included Components; embedded spreadsheet of:
        * Qty
        * Component (list of options)
      * Require Finish (checkbox; if checked, require finish on the order)



  


NOTE: The drawer accessories will stored be separate SKUs/items, such as:

  * Double Silverware (18" wide or less)
  * Double Silverware (19" \- 24" wide)
  * Double Silverware (25" \- 30" wide)
  * Undermount Pullout Spice Rack (3" \- 8" wide; 9" depth)
  * Undermount Pullout Spice Rack (3" \- 8" wide; 21" depth)
  * Undermount Pullout Spice Rack (9" \- 12" wide; 9" depth)
  * Undermount Pullout Spice Rack (9" \- 12" wide; 21" depth)
  * Etc
