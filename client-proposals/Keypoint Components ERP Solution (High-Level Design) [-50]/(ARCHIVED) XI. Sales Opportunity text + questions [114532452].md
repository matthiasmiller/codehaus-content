Tell me a little more about your business--what do you do, what services do you provide? 

  * We manufacture dovetail drawers and custom components for cabinets & furniture companies
    * Highly custom components--utensil drawers, makeup drawers, u-shaped drawers, etc. 
      * [www.keypointcomponents.com](http://www.keypointcomponents.com) 
      * Almost anything you can dream about putting in a kitchen, we can do it
      * Currently doing approx. 10-15 orders/day, 400 dovetail drawers/day
      * Approximately 130 active customers



  


What are the challenges or problems you're facing? What are you looking to solve with custom software? 

  * Pricing is fairly complicated
    * Use dimensions of drawer box to get sq. footage
    * Sq. ft * price based on material (eg. wood type, etc.)
    * Pricing for bottom based on sq. footage
    * Per box cost for finish, drilling, etc. 
  * I want a system that we can use for pricing and project management, where we enter all information only one time
    * The system would then generate cut list, shipping list, invoice; all from the data we entered at the beginning
  * With various managers in the office, if we don't have all the details, we get into problems
    * All sorts of information that needs to be communicated for each project
  * I would like a system where we can enter all the customer and project information at the beginning
    * When a customer comes back, I put in the customer's name and all his normal preferences are right there
  * Our biggest challenge in billing is customers want a per-drawer cost on the invoice
    * Currently, we don't show that on our invoice--just the total amount
    * This is a must--our customers are begging me for this



  


Matthias Miller 03/09/2022: 

  * explanation of pricing model



  


  


[ ] Do you want to use Contact Types? If yes, what should they be?  

Matthias Miller 03/15/2022: I think this is NA, right?

  


[ ] Do you want to use the calendar date picker? 

Matthias Miller 03/15/2022: They like when they put the date in on the sheet itself, and in that case, then it would be easier not to use the calendar date picker.

  


[ ] Do you want to import data from an existing system or spreadsheet? If yes, what? 

Matthias Miller 03/15/2022:

  * QuickBooks customer names -- we should do that
  * Has nothing except whatever he has in QB, which would be the Items for pricing
  * This system becomes the source of truth for pricing, then pushes pricing information over to QB -- any pricing that he has in QB is just a set number that they put in, and it's figuring anything out by putting in a size.
  * 


  


[ ] What data access restrictions/permissions do you want? 

Matthias Miller 03/15/2022: Good with that...

  


[ ] Do you want to use time tracking for employees? If yes, by hour or by day and hour?

Matthias Miller 03/15/2022: That's another thing that they're working on around here? Trying to think how they would do that

Matthias Miller 03/15/2022: Would like to have that part of it if he could, and again -- right now, when an order comes in, they file it away, have an ABCD order with the companies names, then just goes through there a couple times a week with ordesr that are close to their due date

  


When you place an order today, there's no way to tell the lead time -- everyone now wants to know lead time, and it depends by the day -- he tells them, give me the date -- some are 3 weeks out, and some are ordering 3 days out, etc -- 

  


Matthias Miller 03/15/2022: Right now, at looking at all the numbers we have, could we come up with an easy number of how long that would take? Last week in sales, this week in sales, and month over month it is very consistent, and he thinks $ would be a farily true.

Matthias Miller 03/15/2022: Been in shops where they've got a 3x3 screen hanging from the ceiling where there's red, green, and other colors -- job names, etc -- where these things get tracked -- would rather try to grow into a station-based system, rather than do it now
