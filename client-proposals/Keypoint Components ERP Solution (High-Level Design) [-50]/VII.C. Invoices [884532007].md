7.3. Invoices

  


Requirements

Orders will be automatically exported to QuickBooks invoices. The invoice line items will be grouped together on a per-drawer basis. The invoices can then be printed from QuickBooks.

  


Any orders that need to be printed from the Solution can be printed using the Order printout.

  


Development Specification

TODO_IDD: This should go down below QB Syncing. No Invoice printout in the Solution.

TODO_IDD: Tim Reitz 05/10/2022:Client says he does not like his current invoice (maybe he means the printout). Gets a lot of questions from customers, and has to go through all his calculations, etc. They want a price per drawer.
