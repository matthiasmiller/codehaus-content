7.1. Order Printout

  


Requirements

The Order printout would be based on a template, and would probably be similar to the current order page. 

  


This printout could be generated blank, for the purpose of printing for hand-entered orders (accessible from a "Print Blank Order Form" menu option). 

  


This printout could also be generated from an Order record, with the order details included. 

  


Once these changes have been made, Keypoint can update their online PDF template to match the updated design.

  


Development Specification

TODO_IDD: Tim Reitz 05/10/2022:Client would prefer for this printout to be similar to the current one, but it doesn't need to be exactly the same.
