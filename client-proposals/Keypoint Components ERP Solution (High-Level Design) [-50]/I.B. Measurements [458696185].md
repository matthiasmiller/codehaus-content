1.2. Measurements

  


Requirements

All measurements should allow up to 2 decimals, rounding down as needed to the nearest 1/16th.

  


For example, 1/16 is 0.0625. It should be entered and displayed as 0.06. If the user enters 0.05, it should round down to 0.

  


Development Specification

TODO_IDD: Tim Reitz 05/04/2022: Something doesn't seem right with the notes above about rounding ("If the user enters 0.05, it should round down to 0." \- it probably should say, "... enters 0.005..."? ). We need to investigate this.
