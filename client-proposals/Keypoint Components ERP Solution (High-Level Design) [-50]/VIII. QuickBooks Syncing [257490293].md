8\. QuickBooks Syncing

The Solution will provide the following syncing with QuickBooks:

  


  * Contacts. These will be stored in the Solution and pushed across to QuickBooks. Any changes in QuickBooks will be overwritten in the next sync.



  


  * Sales Items. These will be stored in QuickBooks and linked to sales items in the Solution.



  


  * Tax Codes. These will be stored in QuickBooks and will be read-only in Solution.



  


  * Invoices. These will be automatically created based on orders and pushed into QuickBooks. These can be edited in QuickBooks. If changes are made in the Solution after the invoice is created, the invoice can be re-sent, either updating the existing invoice or creating a new one. (This would require the old invoice to be manually voided in QuickBooks.)
