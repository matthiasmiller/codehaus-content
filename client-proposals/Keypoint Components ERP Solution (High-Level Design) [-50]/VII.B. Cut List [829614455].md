7.2. Cut List

  


Requirements

The Cut List printout would be based on a template, and would probably be similar to the current cut list. The Solution would automatically run calculations based on the items in the order, and generate the cut list accordingly. This would ONLY be generated for standard drawers.

  


This would include the Special Order Instructions with a bold notice in red font with the customer preferences and any other special instructions from the Customer record.

  


For large orders, Keypoint currently splits the cut lists into "batches" of 18-20 drawers. This seems like a good amount per list, so the cut lists generated by the Solution would do the same. Each page should be labeled as "Part 1 of 3", etc.

  


The cut list should correspond directly with the Order form. Show the Row # from the Order form on the corresponding cut list row.

  


Development Specification

Template + calculations

  


The expressions would be order-level expressions running in the Drawer RG context, returning "10.125x5.5" etc. The Qty would be multiplied by the number of drawers, except for Sides which would be x2, as well as Front/Back which are x2.

  


TODO_IDD: Tim Reitz 05/10/2022: Client doesn't care if the cut list is different from the current one. "As long as it's easy to read at a glance", he said.
