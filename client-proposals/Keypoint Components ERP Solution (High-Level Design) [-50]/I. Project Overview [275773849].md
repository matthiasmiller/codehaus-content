1\. Project Overview

  


Requirements

Keypoint Components, located in Wisconsin, crafts and sells custom dovetail drawer boxes and drawer components for cabinet and furniture makers. The components can be sold either as part of a drawer or by themselves (e.g. spice boxes, trash bins, etc.).

  


Keypoint is currently doing approximately 10-15 orders/day, totaling around 400 dovetail drawers/day. They have approximately 130 active customers.

  


Pricing is fairly complicated, as Keypoint uses dimensions of the drawer boxes to get square footage, with a square foot price, and with additional costs for finish, drilling, etc. 

  


Keypoint is looking for a system that they can use for pricing and project management, where they enter all information only one time - at the very beginning - and the system would then generate pricing, cut list, shipping list, and invoice from that information. 

  


A successful software solution would entail customer-friendly ordering and price reporting, as well as staff-friendly data tracking and calculations.

  


This is a high-level design proposal of what an AppHosting software solution (referred to as "the Solution" throughout this document) would look like.
