2.3. In the Truss Prints section

  * New "Truss Prints" Memo: 
    * This would replace the existing Truss Prints memo 
    * This memo would be auto-generated and read-only. 
    * It would include section headings for "Current Prints" (for current prints), as well as "Previous Revisions" (from history).



  


  * For existing orders (created prior to the update adding this Print Requests feature) with truss prints, there would be an ellipsis button on the section header of the Truss Prints section that would open a editable memo of all prints from the old Truss Prints memo. The ellipsis button would be hidden if there are no old prints. 



  


  *  "View/Edit Truss Prints" button on the quote/order details. 
    * This would open the View/Edit Truss Prints Child Screen that would show all trusses from the order:
      * "Truss <__> of <__> (<__> Incomplete)" with Next/Previous buttons
      * Truss Request (embedded; read-only)
      * Truss Prints (embedded memo; read-only if completed)
      * Truss Print Completed (checkbox; warn on save if checked without an attachment in Truss Prints)
      * Truss History (button; editable memo that shows all prior truss print requests and prints)
