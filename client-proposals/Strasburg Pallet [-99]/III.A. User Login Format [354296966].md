3.1. User Login Format

Users can log into their accounts with

[ ] a username/password or

[ ] using a Google account (called "Quick Login").

[ ] both

  


[ ] The login format (UN/PW or Quick Login) is determined on the user's User Profile. If using the UN/PW format, the password is also set on the User Profile. These are standard features. 

  


[ ] Password requirements: Minimum of 6 characters; at least 1 capital letter, 1 number, and 1 special character ("Alpha, Numeric, Symbol"). This is set in the System Switches section of the database. 

  


Other Notes: 

  * Note that an email address is required by the database for all User Logins, even if the user is not using the Quick Login format. If a user does not have an email address, one workaround if for the admin to enter a Gmail or Gmail-hosted email address and simply add "+" and the user's name before the "@" symbol. CodeHaus can provide more information on this process.
