18.4. Customer Scheduling

  


Requirements

TODO_CH: work on this! 

  


The customer scheduling can be provided either through:

  * A set of reports to easily view/update customer schedules
  * A read-only calendar view of customer schedules
  * An editable calendar view of customer schedules



Tim Reitz 12/07/2021: Let's also look at third-party solutions that we could tie into the database. 

  


This should be designed to support at least basic usability on a mobile device for outside sales. 

  


The specifics will be determined as part of the in-depth design.

  


Development Specification

Ideas from Jesse:

  * Things a list view could work, but the complications from going from one to the other is a big factor.
  * Would there be such a thing like a calendar view that's not completely interactive? Don't want to switch between two views, but gives a visual.
  * For the calendar, it would be a month view.
  * Maybe a link on it, to edit the date.
    * Or give it a popup.
  * For a mobile view...how does this work for Joe?
