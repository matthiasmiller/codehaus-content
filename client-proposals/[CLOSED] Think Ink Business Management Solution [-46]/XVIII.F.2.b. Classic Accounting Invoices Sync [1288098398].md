18.6.2.2. Classic Accounting Invoices Sync

  


Requirements

Classic Accounting invoices would be synced as read-only copies into the solution.

  


All invoices created for MSAs using the standard Invoices module would be ___

TODO_TR - This depends on the reporting that we need to do, and whether we create equivalent AppHosting Invoices, or whether we just report off the CA invoives.

  


DONE_CH: What information to pursue for this? And who should pursue it (Tim or Matthias)?

TODO_TR / TODO_JM: Which fields go in which direction?

  


TODO_CH: how to make sure we don't re-sync past items from CA to AHZ? (maybe look back 30 days for unpaid invoices?)

Note: CA has a line item ID.

  


Development Specification

TODO_IDD: dangling sentence here.
