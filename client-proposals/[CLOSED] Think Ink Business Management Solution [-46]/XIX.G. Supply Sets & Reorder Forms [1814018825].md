19.7. Supply Sets & Reorder Forms

TODO: This should actually be split into separate sections if/when we pick it up.

  


  


DONE_CH: how to set up Supply Sets (supplies/items that fit a certain Device Model)? (note that some are for Think Ink only and some are for sharing with the customer).

TODO_TR:

[ ] Presumably have two RGs, one for customer and one for parts/internal

[ ] It seems this could be a SKU Category with custom SKUs.

[ ] When showing lists, show them as "Brand Model Description [SKUID]", such as on devices etc

  


TODO_CH: how to generate Reorder Forms based on current/past purchases AND Device Models (supply set). Currently printed with the invoice, but would be nice to explore this more. Note: This could be a future phase.
