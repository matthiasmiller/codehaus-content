13.3.1. All Invoices Report

  


Requirements

TODO_TR: maybe not the standard report?? (depending on what we do with CA invoices) 

This is the standard AppHosting All Invoices report, and is a report of all invoices in the Solution. This is a multi-pane report, with the left-hand pane providing the following views:

  * Open Invoices
  * Closed Invoices
  * All Invoices
  * Recent Invoices (show invoices that have been edited within the last ~30-60 days (entire last month plus current partial month to date)



  


This would be accessed from an "Invoices" menu option on the Financial menu. 

TODO_JM: which menu?
