19.3. Office Supplies Vendor Management

  


Requirements

If Think Ink moves into providing office supplies, they'll need an integration with their vendor to support the volume. Think Ink will pursue avenues to explore API integration with their vendor, or with one of their vendor's supported platforms.

  


This will allow Think Ink to pull stock for office supplies, push sales orders to the vendor, and collecting tracking and order status from their vendor.

  


From a technology standpoint, there are two approaches:

  * Using an API integration. This has the highest likelihood of success and the lowest long-term cost.
  * Using browser automation. This does not require negotiation with the vendor. However, it will require updates and changes as the vendor changes their website.



  


Development Specification

I don't know if we want to go down the route of Selenium, but I'm thinking that route for automation.
