3.1.1. Login Format

  


Requirements

Users can log into their accounts with either a Google account (called "Quick Login") or a username & password. The default login is the Google account, but this can be overridden on a per-user basis. Users logging in with the username/password ("UN/PW") format will use an alternate login link such as "think.apphosting.zone/LoginSecondary". 

  


The login format (Quick Login or UN/PW) is determined on the user's User Profile. If using the UN/PW format, the password is also set on the User Profile. If a one or more users wish to use the UN/PW format, CodeHaus can assist in setting it up for the initial user, and provide instructions for additional users. 

  


For UN/PW, the password requirements are as follows: Minimum of 6 characters; at least 1 capital letter, 1 number, and 1 special character ("Alpha, Numeric, Symbol"). This is set in the System Switches section of the database. 

  


Other Notes: 

  * Note that an email address is required by the database for all User Logins, even if the user is not using the Quick Login format. If a user does not have an email address, one workaround if for the admin to enter a Gmail or Gmail-hosted email address and simply add "+" and the user's name before the "@" symbol. CodeHaus can provide more information on this process.
  * If a user wishes to use the Quick Login format but does not have a Gmail address, they can set up a Google Account with a different email address and use that account for the Quick Login.
