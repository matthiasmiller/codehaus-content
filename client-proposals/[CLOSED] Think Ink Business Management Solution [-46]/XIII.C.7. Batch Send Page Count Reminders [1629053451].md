13.3.7. Batch Send Page Count Reminders

Menu option "Batch Send Page Count Reminders". Would run on the printers (see expression above). We'll need to clarify the wording for the email with the client, but basically a reminder that the customer's device(s) are lacking a page count report (email would need an expression to list the printers).

  


This is a report to preview everyone who is getting a reminder and their corresponding printer(s).

  


This would be accessed from the home page.
