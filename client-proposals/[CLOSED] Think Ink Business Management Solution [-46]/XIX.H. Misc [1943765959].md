19.8. Misc

Region recored: 

  * Week (optional; drop list of First Week, Second Week, Third Week, Fourth Week; solution looks at the Monday of the week to determine which week it is - e.g. if Tuesday is the 1st day of the month, that week would count as the last week of the previous)



_EM: Tim Reitz 08/08/2023: How should we handle weeks? Client not thinking they'll do weeks for a long time, but would like to have the capability if it's not too much work.

DONE_JM: Tim Reitz 08/09/2023: Our suggestion is to just do the Months for now, and save the Weeks for later. To get clarity on how you want things to work and not design/code stuff that might need to change. Focus on highest value for now. 

TODO_IDD: Tim Reitz 08/10/2023: Client is fine with saving weeks for later.
