3.3.2.1. View Contacts Report

  


Requirements

This is the standard AppHosting Contacts report, with no customizations, and would be used as a general report of all contacts in the Solution. It already is part of the the base version of the Solution that Think Ink is using. 

  


Note that this will include a multi-select drop list filter for Contact Tags.
