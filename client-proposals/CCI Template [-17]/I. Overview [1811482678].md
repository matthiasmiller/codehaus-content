Requirements

Project Why/Overview: Include a Project Overview section at the top of the proposal that

  * explains what the solution will provide and how it will address the pain points.



  


Tim Reitz 07/17/2020: probably move to a different section in this template: 

Providing Visuals: When doing things like an order form, supply a sample hand-written order form or whatever they are currently using. This helps us a lot with getting field sizes right, etc.  Long-term maybe you'll just bake more of that into the mockups that do.
