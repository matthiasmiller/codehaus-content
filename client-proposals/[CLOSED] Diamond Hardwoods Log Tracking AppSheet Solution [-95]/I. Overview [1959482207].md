1\. Overview

  


Requirements

Diamond Hardwoods is looking for a solution to manage log purchasing and distribution. This entails handling various details about individual logs, and tracking the logs from the time they are entered into the solution. 

  


This proposal / design spec is for a temporary solution of spreadsheets and a basic mobile app, created with the Google AppSheet platform. 

  


The temporary solution would presumably be replaced by a fuller and more robust Silverloom-based solution, once design and development can be completed.

  


Development Specification

Tim Reitz 11/05/2024: Client stopped this project (elected to go with an industry-specific solution). Marking this proposal as Closed today.
