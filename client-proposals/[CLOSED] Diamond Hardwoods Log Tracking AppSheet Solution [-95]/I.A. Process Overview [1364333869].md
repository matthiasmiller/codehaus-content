1.1. Process Overview

The following is a basic overview of the workflow for the AppSheet app:

  * Log Buyer sets up a new "Purchase Batch" in the app, and adds logs.
  * The app calculates various totals as logs are added.
  * Log Buyer marks the Purchase Batch as closed.
  * The Purchase Batch details are synced to a spreadsheet, for the logs to be managed from there for the rest of the process. 



  


The full Silverloom solution could include additional features on the app side of things, but the main improvement would be in the area of managing logs after they have been entered in the app -- tracking and managing them as they are used internally by Diamond Hardwoods or shipped out to other sawmills.
