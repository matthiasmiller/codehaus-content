3.2. Spot Securement

With the current lead times on poultry buildings, spots can be secured with a $5,000 payment. This can currently happen before or after an RFQ. In the near future, these spots can be reserved by the integrator.

  


These spots are currently assigned 45-50 weeks prior to the build. The crew is assigned at this point.

  


The project gets entered into JobPack.
