3.6. Drafting & Engineering

Standard buildings will not go through the Tekla signoff, since the visuals can be confirmed as part of the sales process.

  


For non-standard buildings, the first phase is the 3D model, then signoff from the customer. Once the customer approves it, all changes require change orders. Pole barns will be engineered and stamped at this point. The drawings will then be drafted at that point.

  


From here:

  * LetSync generates the equipment list
  * Tekla generates the takeoff
