Primary Challenge:Wants to hear more about Silverloom especially. At the moment they're running on quick books and just purchased paragon, and would like to bring a pretty basic software that would manage their leads and see conversations of their sales guys.

Ben Reitz 05/14/2024: Ellis and I had our call with Clyde yesterday. Here are the call notes: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UJ5-dxnLy3kRAQGDlqA3sb3DP2CLY5LSeq2DJv6q_Rs/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UJ5-dxnLy3kRAQGDlqA3sb3DP2CLY5LSeq2DJv6q_Rs/edit)

  


Call Summary:

Overview:

  * We spoke with Clyde (business and Sheldon
  * Located in Buffalo, Missouri
  * Has a feed mill for chicken feed
  * Also sells material packages and general contracting for those packages
  * Also has a manufacturing facility
  * Everything in the feed mill is handled separately from the rest of the business and they are pleased with everything that is needed there
  * For the building side of the business, they currently using a mixture of Excel, QuickBooks, Paradigm by Paragon, JobPack, and Tekla
  * They like Paradigm and JobPack quite well but neither of those track leads or quotes
  * Currently using Excel for leads and quotes
  * Looking for a software solution that would do better than Excel at tracking leads, quotes, and contracts (ideally this software would also integrate with all their other softwares)
  * Getting 10-15 leads per week
  * Have 2 salespeople and 2 1/2 people doing quoting
  * Nearly all leads are reaching out via phone call to a call center
  * The people at the call center have a basic questionnaire that they use for the leads to be able to class them 1-6
    * 1 means they aren’t a good fit and get dropped immediately
    * 2 means they’re a tire kicker or checking out prices
    * 3 means they’re a solid lead and are waiting on HS; if the ball goes back into the lead’s court, it gets bumped back to a 2
      * 2’s are reviewed every other week
    * 4 means they’re a good lead but they went with someone else
    * 5 means they’re a great fit and the salesperson is 90% sure that they’ll move forward
    * 6 means the job is sold
  * They’d like to be able to rank and prioritize leads
  * A dashboard that monitors and keeps track of leads by salesperson would be a great feature
  * So far they haven’t done any online softwares
  * Having a software that could be installed on Windows but would not open in a browser would meet their needs



Thoughts from Ellis:

  * We would love to work with you but it would be worth have a conversation with Paragon to make sure that they’re okay with integrating with us



  


Next Steps:

  * Ellis would like to have a second call to discuss this in more detail
  * Ben will send Project Design Overview and System Screenshots
  * Clyde and Sheldon will relay this conversation with several other guys who need to be brought up to speed and then they would be ready to schedule another call



  


Ellis Miller 06/06/2024: Clyde is responsible for Sales / Business Development. We should have Sheldon  be the primary contact\- 417-327-5885, HR / Accounting / Purchasing. Scheduled an 11AM CT call for Friday 6/6.

  


They don't use web browser, but may be able to use a Silverloom Windows application.

  


Ben Reitz 06/07/2024: Ellis and I had a second call with Sheldon. The notes are at the bottom of this doc: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UJ5-dxnLy3kRAQGDlqA3sb3DP2CLY5LSeq2DJv6q_Rs/edit#heading=h.lyp2xeu57smg](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UJ5-dxnLy3kRAQGDlqA3sb3DP2CLY5LSeq2DJv6q_Rs/edit#heading=h.lyp2xeu57smg)

  


Summary:

  * HSC has an IT guy from another business who knows someone with the capability to create a custom software for them.
  * HSC is still in the exploring phase so they aren't committing to this other company yet
  * Ellis and Sheldon discussed a few things that we discussed in the first call regarding integration with Paradigm and JobPack
  * Ellis encouraged Sheldon to look for a company that can be around long-term and to avoid companies with only one developer
  * HSC has internet but they're trying to stay away from web browsers and only use it for updating applications like QuickBooks
  * Ellis said that we could either do a whitelisted site for them or we could create a desktop application for them that would still need internet that would connect with our servers.
    * We have this technology already but have been waiting for a client who can utilize it
  * Sheldon likes the idea of the desktop application



  


Next Steps:

  * There is an HSC Leadership meeting next Tuesday and Sheldon is going to bring up the software discussion there to see where they want to go with this.
  * Ben will connect Sheldon with Tripe D as a reference
  * Sheldon will reach out at the end of next week; if we don't hear from him next week, we will reach out the following week

Call Summary:

Overview:

  * We spoke with Sheldon and Kelly (CEO)
  * They're very interested in moving forward with us but are also cautious in making sure that we're a good fit for each other
  * HSC would have over 100 computers and probably over 100 users using the software
  * Kelly is interested in using Silverloom but would like to take some additional steps to ensure that it's a good match
  * The $3500 HLD doesn't scare HSC
  * Kelly proposed that several people from both companies meet in person sometime



  


Next Steps:

  * Both CCI and HSC will take some time to make some notes for each other regarding core values, etc.
  * We will have a Zoom meeting on July 23rd at 2:00pm CT / 3:00pm ET to share these core values and go through several questions on the technical side of things
  * After that Zoom call, we will explore the possibility of meeting in person



  


Ben Reitz 08/16/2024: Ellis received the following email from Brian Ehst:

  


Good afternoon Ellis.

  


Just wanted to reach out and introduce myself. I am the marketing director for Hostetler Sales and Construction based in Buffalo MO.

  


Kenneth Kauffman gave me your e-mail that you would tried to reach out to Sheldon. I just wanted to follow up and give you my e-mail as well as my cell phone which is 573-378-8660.

  


I am helping to facilitate and organize some of the software and hardware as well as marketing upgrades that we're trying to do.

  


I believe it was our goal to try to talk to you about possible ERP solutions.

  


Feel free to give me a call or send me an email back period thank you,

  


Ellis asked me to record this and update the primary contact to Brian.

  


Ellis Miller 08/28/2024: Got VM, so sent text message:

Brian, after I started calling, I thought I should have asked earlier if you prefer phone, text, or email as a default communication option. Just touching base to see if there are ways we can help or if you would be ready to reschedule the meeting we had planned for July 23rd. Blessings on your day!

  


I'll be traveling to Bangladesh from Sept 12-20 and to Colorado from Sept 24-26. Most other days I could rearrange my schedule. If needed, I could potentially do a call in my evening from Bangladesh, but that wouldn't be quite as easy.

  


  


Tim Reitz 08/30/2024: Call with Kelly and Sheldon today. 

  * Ellis gave an intro to CCI 



  


  * Kelly shared about Hostetler Sales & Construction: 
  * Kelly's grandfather moved into the MO Ozark hills in 1964. 
  * Manufacturing started in 1966. 
  * Very large Mennonite & Amish 
  * Currently 3 divisions, 6 locations: 
    * Manufacturing: 
      * Steel building manufacturing (steel structures, agriculture & commercial spheres) 
      * Sheet metal manufacturing (started as poultry feeding equipment, etc., but also into other spheres) 
    * Contracting (construction) 
    * Distribution 
      * Retail / feed mill (previously feed supply & hardware stores, now not selling bagged feed, but focused on the other products that  
      * Building sales 
  * 2011: transition process started from Kelly's dad to Kelly 
  * 2013: Ownership changes -- about 21 owners bought in
    * Changed from ownership-managed, to manager-managed 
    * Ownership board (all owners?) 
    * Kelly & Sheldon are owners, but answer to the board 
  * A lot of changes have happened with the roll over to a 3rd generation of ownership. 
    * Lots of motivation to succeed and avoid the likelihood of failure that come with a 3rd-generation family business. 
    * Helped to lose the sense of entitlement that comes with family businesses. 
    * Helped bring fresh vision and ways of doing things (people who weren't stuck in the rut of how things have always been done, etc.). 
    * Did a lot of hard work in looking at suppliers, etc., and were able to 
  * Kelly has a concern for setting a good stage for future owners / generations, to not get into a bad situation. 
    * Were introduce to the EOS (Entrepreneurial Operating System) 
    * Decided to not set sales projections for 10 years; OK with 3 years 
    * Have spent time trying to figure out how big is too big; are they currently too big now; etc. Haven't really answered that question, but have been searching to see how the Lord would have them function. 
    * Big questions: What can we do today to lay a good foundation for future members to continue to seek to serve the Lord and fellow man? 
    * Shared core values (see call recording, approx 1 hour in) 
    * Have come up with a program that they call "1+1=3": "Together we are more." 
      * Recognize the need to live it out before they teach -- asking for feedback from people across the company
      * Subjects: 
        * Understanding God's Love, loving the Lord above all else 
        * Loving our neighbor as ourself 
        * Understanding and living our core values 
        * Understanding God's leading 
        * Understanding the need to have the right people int he right seats 
        * Serving 
        * Understanding my perfect job
        * Understanding stewardship vs. ownership 
        * Understanding what it means to be a kingdom-focused company 
        * Intentional contribution plan 
        * Understanding investments (following God's will, not just what makes "business sense") 
      * Vision: That in 10 years everyone working at our company is committed and involved in 1+1=3, and new owners and leadership have graduated the program...
    * Shared a slide show of work they've done
      * Do all their own drafting in-house
      * Have a 3rd-party architectural firm that does the official stamping of their plans
      * Do both the steel frame/structure and the exterior metal 
      * One of their specialties is a chicken house that they have really honed in. 
  * About 130 employees in the plants
  * Subcontractors for installing (about 250 people)
    * Booked out for about a year
  * At this point they have so much work on the poultry side that they're moving toward hitting pause on the non-poultry buildings to focus on the poultry side, as well as to be able to focus on other things that can be improved. 
  * Very focused on their core values -- to the point that if a potential hire is not on board with the "1+1=3", it probably won't be a good fit. 



  


  * Ellis shared the CCI core values, core goals, etc. 
  * Kelly mentioned that there's no doubt that HSC and CCI share a lot of core values. 
    * Affirming the focus of putting people first. 
    * "As we grow, our limiting factor is our people." 
    * Moving into the idea of developing software, if we're working with people who share our values, there's more momentum and potential. 
      * The product is important, but if the people fit isn't right, it probably won't be good long-term. 



  


  * High level of what HSC needs: 
    * Working with Kenneth K (marketing) 
    * As they're pausing their non-poultry construction work, they're thinking about marketing. It's a different marketing vertical. 
    * A lot of the poultry work is focused on the farmer specifically (not so much billboards, trade shows, etc.) 
      * Word of mouth is big for both poultry and non. 
    * Current systems: 
      * Using QB for primary accounting
      * Paradigm for metal plant 
      * Paper lists for __ (tracking stuff in and out of the plants??) 
      * Hundreds of Excel spreadsheets 
        * Linking together 
        * Some guys are really good with them 
        * Some departments are looking at 10 spreadsheets to get something done
      * Other software items that need to be incorporated: 
      * A scheduling software
      * SolidWorks 
      * Tekla 
      * An enterprise feedmill software 
      * Others 
    * Looking at needing a CRM 
    * Issues: 
      * Data stored in multiple places 
      * A change in one spreadsheet affecting lots of people, and needing to communicate that 
      * Etc. 
      * Need to be able to track things all the way through: Leads / sales / agreements / contracts / design / etc. 
    * Considering the possibility of using Paragon / Paradigm as their central ERP. 
      * But Paradigm is very industry-specific (metal rollforming) 
      * There's also a point-of-sale (HSC's current POS is a "ticking time bomb" of sorts -- the provider stopped support) 
    * HSC wonders if CCI could provide consulting for software options 
      * Ellis said that yes, we would for clients. 



  


  * Kelly said that he got today what he was wanting regarding who we are as CCI. He doesn't feel like he needs to know more about CodeCrafters -- they've done homework, looked into things, discussed with us, etc. 
  * Kelly is wondering what the next steps are for design. 
    * Possible on-site visit
    * HSC work through the document that Ellis had sent over
    * We should work on this in phases, not bite off too much to chew 
      * HSC said they would rely on CCI's expertise for guiding to process along the way
    * HSC already has 3-year goals related to improving software
    * Maybe start out with a clear deliverable -- perhaps the leads / sales management portion. 



  


  * Discussed price in a big picture (no specific quoting other than monthly base fees / user fees)
  * Discussed how hosting works
    * Currently, they host all of their data, but they do have internet connection for software 
    * Note from earlier conversation: They don't use web browser, but may be able to use a Silverloom Windows application.
    * Kelly is concerned that they can fit in with their community guidelines. He doesn't see anything that is a dealbreaker, but wants to be conscientious. 
    * Ellis shared that it would be possible to do on-site hosting, but it would be very expensive (he said maybe $5-6K per month instead of $150/month on AWS). 
    * Ellis also said that there also is the option of using a custom software interface, instead of the browser access. 
      * Kelly said that this could be a good option for them. 



  


  * HSC is good with moving forward with the HLD ($3500). 
    * Sheldon will start working on the list of questions
    * Kelly said that at this point it's not super urgent to make anything happen right away ("no fires to put out right now").
