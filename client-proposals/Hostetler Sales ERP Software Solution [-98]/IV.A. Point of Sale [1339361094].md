4.1. Point of Sale

The retail locations need a point of sale to process orders from in-person orders and from catalog sales.

  


This needs to make selling quick and easy -- pulling up customer names, item by name or number, pulling up inventory amounts, etc.

  


This will need to handle barcoding and scanning as well.

  


This will need to go through the picking, loading, and shipping process. Most of these packages will be shipped with standard package carriers such as FedEx, UPS, etc. It's possible that in the future, Hostetler will do some of their deliveries with their own carrier van.
