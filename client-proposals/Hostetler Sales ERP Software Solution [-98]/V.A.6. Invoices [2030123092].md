5.1.6. Invoices

  


Requirements

The solution will need to generate invoices, linked by Customer and Job.

  


These need to handle tax exempt invoices, tracking signature confirmations that the invoice is tax-exempt.

  


These need to be calculated from sales orders, change orders, and credits.

  


Development Specification
