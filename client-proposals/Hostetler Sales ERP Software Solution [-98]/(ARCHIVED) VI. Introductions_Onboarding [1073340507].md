[X] _HLD: Copy in the questions and responses from the "Onboarding" email in [[[W0312](https://zch.apphosting.zone/Detail/Edit/2?RecordType=WikiPages&NumberID=-313&)]] - 13. High-Level Design Prep Emails: 

  


1\. Do you have Zoom or are you able to get it for the design calls? We use Zoom for the audio, video (if our client is comfortable with it), and occasional screen sharing during our virtual design phases. If you aren't able to join online via the main Zoom platform, you can dial in from a phone for the audio conversation, without downloading or installing anything. If you would like to get Zoom and need help setting it up, you can just let me know.

  


Response:

We have a Zoom Computer that we will be able to use, but the camera will be off.

  


  


2\. Related to question #1: Do we have your permission to record our design calls? We like to record the calls for reference later on in the project if needed. Only CodeHaus/CodeCrafters have access to these recordings, and we can delete them at the conclusion of the development of the project. We can also share the recordings with you if you would like to access them later for your own reference.

  


Response:

We are Comfortable with Your Decision on this.

  


  


3\. Would you like access to a Google Doc of call notes from the High-Level Design calls? 

  


Response:

Would you be able to get these in a PDF and sent to us?

  


  


4\. Who from your team will be joining these calls? We recommend getting the involvement of the main people who would be using the software solution. This might not be for the whole design phase, but at least for the discussions that pertain to the parts of the software that they will be using. If you have managers, a bookkeeper, or others who will be using the software heavily and whose input would be valuable, we welcome their involvement! We can also add them to some or all of the correspondence if you'd like.

  


Response:

NA

  


  


[X] _HLD: Copy in the questions and responses from email #4 in [[[W0312](https://zch.apphosting.zone/Detail/Edit/2?RecordType=WikiPages&NumberID=-313&)]] - 13. High-Level Design Prep Emails:

  


  


1\. On a scale of 1 to 10, how important is it to access the software from a mobile device, such as a phone or tablet? 

  


Response:

(7) Most of our People are using Microsoft Surface 9 Pro.

 

2\. Do you want to import data from an existing software system or spreadsheets? If yes, what data (i.e. contacts, sales items, invoices, etc.)? 

  


Response:

Yes, We would need more clarification on what this Question Means, to get a list to you.

 

3\. We offer two options for login format: A quick login using Gmail/Google accounts, and a username/password login. It can also be set up so that some users use one and others use the other. Which format would you prefer?

  


Response:

username/password.

 

4\. Will you want to restrict access to certain portions of the system from some users? If so, you can be thinking through what groups of users you will want to have and what portions of the system you would like them to be able to access.  

  


Response:

Yes, we will need to wait until we get more of a concept of where this is going.

 

5\. Do you want to use time tracking for employees?

  


Response:

Yes.

 

6\. What would you like to call the software solution? Sometimes our clients refer to it with a generic term such as "CRM system" or "our software", but some clients like to give their solution a more specific name. It's nice to give it a name or description that is and easy to use. We don't need this right away, but you can be thinking about this as we get started on the design. 

  


Response:

We will start thinking.😊

      * Simply the name of the business.
