2\. Lines of Business

Hostetler has two lines of business:

  * Poultry Buildings, including table egg and other poultry (broiler/meat)
  * Non-Poultry Buildings (garages, shops, storage buildings, etc)



  


Most of their business is agricultural. They have some existing commercial customers in rural areas, but do not intend to expand into urban commercial projects.

  


The non-poultry buildings have been sidelined but will come back to the forefront for diversification. They will follow one of two models:

  


  * Turnkey - They will prompt a brand and get leads from end users, bring them through the pipeline, and connect them with a contractor who can manage the project and complete it. This will increase the lead flow by 10-50X, and it will require a much more proactive sales process.



  


  * Packages - The Hostetler niche is as a value-add solution, which is their ideal world and where they want to be. In this case, the contractor would generate leads, have their sales team, do the estimate, sign the contract, and send it off to Hostetler internal sales to review and process.



  


NOTE: Hostetler has a separate sheet fabrication business, but it doesn't need to be considered in the short-term.
