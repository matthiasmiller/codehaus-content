3.1. Leads

The solution will track leads, including things such as:

  


  * Name & Contact Information
  * Call Notes
  * Lead Source
  * Opportunity Status (open/lost/won)
  * Followup Date
  * Lead Type
    * Poultry (Table Egg)
    * Poultry (Other)
    * Non-Poultry
  * Origination Date/Time
  * Callback Date/Time
  * Owner (salesperson)



  


The reporting will need to work in numerous dimensions:

  * Salesperson
  * Sales Team (i.e. Poultry Team vs. Non-Poultry Team)
  * Lead Type
  * Inside Salesperson
  * Superintendent
  * Crew (committed sales)
  * Date Committed
  * Date Contract Signed
  * Date Scheduled
  * Sales vs. Projects
  * Sales vs. Goals



  


The solution will need a way to sort leads by how hot they are and be able to prioritize the leads for the salesperson to work first.

  


NOTE: Salespeople will be primarily assigned to either Poultry or Non-Poultry leads, but they will be cross-trained and may sometimes work across those boundaries.
