5.1.5. Change Orders

Change orders can happen two different ways:

  * Run the order through the quoting process, then import it as a sales order. It will match on Job ID and Operation, updating an existing one if present or creating a new one if needed.
  * Manually editing the sales order with the respective changes.



  


Either approach  will trigger notifications to all relevant users.

  


Rules for change orders:

  * Can't remove ordered special items
  * Can't add items that won't be here in time
  * Can't make ANY changes if it anything has been picked



  


Exceptions:

  * Someone somewhere with "I can do anything I want" sales order privileges
