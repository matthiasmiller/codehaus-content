5.1.1. Syncing, Linking & Source of Truth

  


Requirements

Job Linking

  * Jobs are linked by Customer Name and Job Name (matching on active jobs only). Inactive job names can be reused. Active job names cannot. Contractors would typically have multiple jobs; customers typically wouldn't but it could still be a possibility.



  


JobPack Linking

  * Jobs will be linked by Customer Name (matching the Customer in Silverloom) and by Part # (matching the Job Name in Silverloom)
  * Operations will be linked by the Operation Description ("CONSTRUCTION", "ELECTRICAL", etc.)



  


Syncing & Source of Truth:

  * Purchase Orders will be entered into Silverloom and will be exported to QuickBooks.
  * Estimates will be entered into Excel, then sent to Silverloom.
    * Within Silverloom, Estimates can be covered to Sales Orders.
    * Silverloom will export Sales Orders to QuickBooks.



  


Each job will have multiple estimates & sales orders, each one tied to part of the process such as:

  * Concrete List
  * Lumber and Truss Hardware
  * Equipment List that the Building Crew Puts In (fans, etc)
  * Main Equipment List
