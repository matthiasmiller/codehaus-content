4\. Phase 3 - Automatic Tieouts with Time Tracking

  


Requirements

Phase 3 would include the following, and is estimated to cost $4,500-6,900 to implement.  

  


The Invoice will include an Incident ID column. When selected, it will automatically populate the Description and Quantity based on the total number of uninvoiced hours on the incident.

  


The Invoice will also show a list of Incidents for the contact, organization, or contact+organization that have uninvoiced hours. It will include a checkbox that when checked, will add a row to the Invoice for that Incident ID. 

  


NOTE:

  * We have a module that allows specifying billable hourly rates on a per-employee basis. If you would like this functionality, we can discuss it in the in-depth design.



  


Development Specification

TODO_CCI - For details, see the "Matthias Miller - Incidents" catalog. Most of this can probably be refactored to add shared support for these.
