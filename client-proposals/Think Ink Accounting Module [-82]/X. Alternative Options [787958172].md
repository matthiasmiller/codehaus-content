10\. Alternative Options

Here is an overview of alternative approaches:

  


Option 1 - Basic Integration with Classic Accounting. Either hand-enter information in both systems, or develop basic spreadsheets in-house that allow moving information back and forth between the systems.

  


Pros:

  * Low upfront investment
  * Allows building as you go



  


Cons:

  * More manual labor
  * More error prone



  


Option 2 - Automated Integration with Classic Accounting / QuickBooks. Create a read-only mirror of accounting information in Silverloom to allow automatic syncing between Silverloom and QuickBooks. This would be facilitated by a tool such as Transaction Pro or an equivalent tool for Postgres.

  


Pros:

  * No migration of accounting data (Classic Accounting)
  * Industry standard accounting software (QuickBooks)



  


Cons:

  * Higher upfront investment (halfway between alternatives)
  * Needing to “translate” information between the two systems
  * Syncing may break and require more frequent troubleshooting



  


Option 3 - Full Integration. This is the full integration described above and in the remainder of this proposal.

  


Pros:

  * Most streamlined integration across all business departments
  * Leveraging enterprise platform for development
  * Automatic, realtime syncing with almost no failure



  


Cons:

  * Highest investment
  * Fewer accounting features than QuickBooks
