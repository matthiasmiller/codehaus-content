6\. Phase 5 - Soft Accounting Launch

  


Requirements

Phase 5 would entail a soft accounting launch, and is estimated to cost $8,900-13,900 to implement. 

  


This would include a migration of the current accounting system to the Solution, with basic accounting support but no automated transactions.

  


This will require an in-depth look at the functionality of the current and accounting system to ensure everything is working as expected.

  


Development Specification

I think we should improve transaction entry:

  


What do you guys think of having an "Auto-Balance" checkbox on the transaction line RG, only enabled for a single row, that would trigger on changes whenever anyone updates any other items in the RG to make it balance out to zero?

  


This would be used to create a simple new records spreadsheet to make transaction entry easier.
