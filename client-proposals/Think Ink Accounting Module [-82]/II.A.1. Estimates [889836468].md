2.1.1. Estimates

  


Requirements

The Solution will use the standard Estimates.

  


The Estimates report will have an option to exclude any estimates that have already been linked to a Sales Order or Invoice (checked by default).

  


Development Specification

TODO_IDD/TODO_CCI - How hard is this to do? It seems like after an estimate has a SO/IN, we should archive it, no?
