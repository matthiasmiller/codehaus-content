1\. Overview

  


Requirements

Think Ink is looking to streamline their accounting processes. CodeCrafters has designed full integration within their Silverloom platform. This will allow the tightest, most streamlined integration.

  


This solution is for including the Silverloom (AppHosting) Accounting module in Think Ink's existing software. It will include, but is not limited to, items such as Sales Forms, Purchase Orders, Invoices, and integration with Plaid.

  


The design, final pricing, development, and deployment will be broken out into several phases. The estimated ballpark ranges for the phases are included within this proposal.

  


A list of alternative options is included at the end of the proposal.
