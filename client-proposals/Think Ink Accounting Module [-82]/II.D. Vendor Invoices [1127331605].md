2.4. Vendor Invoices

The Solution will include the standard Vendor Invoices, which can be tied out to Purchase Orders.

  


A blank Vendor Invoice will show a list of all uninvoiced items from open POs, showing the following information:

  * PO Entry Date
  * PO Number
  * (Link to Open PO)
  * PO Status
  * PO SKU
  * PODesc
  * # Units Ordered
  * Units of Measure
  * # Units Received
  * Cost (auto-calculated)
