3\. Workflow: Deboning

  


Requirements

We will have a kiosk available where the meat is being deboned. This will have a simple touchscreen interface that will:

  * Prompt for the Order Number
  * Prompt for the Deboned Weight



  


Once the deboned weight has been entered, show the calculated weights for all items (as mentioned earlier) and allow them to be adjusted.

  


Once this has been completed, the workflow will move to Processing.

  


Development Specification

Ellis Miller 06/10/2019: Mostly HTML for Matthias to code, but I think he wants:

  * A simple report that given an order # will give an error message if it's invalid # or the status isn't ready for this.
  * We need a way to set the deboned weight then. Do we use an x30 for that?
  * Matthias Miller 06/10/2019: I don't think we need anything custom.
