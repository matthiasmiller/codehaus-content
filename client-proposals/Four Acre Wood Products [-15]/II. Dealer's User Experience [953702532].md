The dealer will have a specific website they can access to log in.

  


To start a project, the dealer will create an name a job. Then, they will open it into the Pricing Cockpit.

  


  * The quotes get delivered by email, then get cc'd to Raymond--



  


  * Find out how often they are logging in and out -- whether they log in, 10 times a day but never logged in, but has never finalized a quote -- but is utilizing the system -- tracking whether they are using it, but do they also submit or finalize the quotes, not just go in and check the quote...
  * Things that they started and never finished out...



  


<Cabinet Group>| [ ] Wood

  * Would say that it's definitely SOMETIMES different, but not most times different. Probably halfways
  * There are some two-tone seconds -- some black, some white -- most times, the kitchen is one color, and the island is another color. Sometimes there's even color variation within one kitchen.
  * Most times within that specific room, would be that finish/that wood/that distressing

[ ] FinishDistressing[ ] 

  * If the island is cherry, and the hood is in cherry -- it has to be separa
  * Don't want to enter it on every cabinet, but can change it on #10 or whatever, or however you desire.
  * Can be automatically 

  
\----  


  * These cabinets should be grouped by room
  * New Room -- they would have to pick a wood species for every new room.

  * What pieces apply to the entire order?
  * What pieces apply to specific items?
  * It seems like often you want to be able to add options to ALL drawers, but sometimes you might want to be able to only modify.
  * For example, do you want to specify the drawer things for the entire order?



  


  *   * Dealer creates a new job
  * Dealer creates one more cabinets for that job
  * When creating a cabinet, they specify the type
    * Specify all the details, such as wood etc (should the wood be defaulted for the entire job?)



  


At what stage of the process, are they thinking about each specific addon?

  


  


Report of Jobs

  


Imagine a Windows explorer interface for a specific job:

  


  * Group based on Stain/Wood/Distressing (allows editing all in group, or editing individual to break into subgroup)
    * Cabinet 1 -> edit settings -> stain, wood, etc
      * Left Drawer -> can add add-ons to that
      * Right Drawer -
      * Additional Add-ons (such as frame-in door), which can have additional addons, etc
    * Cabinet 2
    * Cabinet 3
  * Group like above
    * Cabinet 4
    * Cabinet 5



  


Matthias Miller 02/04/2020: 

  * Do you use the same wood / stain for every job?
  * Should we include images?
  * Could dealer imagine sitting down w/ client to set things through -- likely to be a dealer markup -- prices would transparently include that?
  * Raymond -- should they see the prices as they select things? How much transparency about pricing? What all can the dealer see?
  * Can make that it can't print.....



  


  * Mock it up -- when you add a piece, it copies the items from the prior piece (as far as wood type, distressing, etc), or that gets applied to the entire job.
