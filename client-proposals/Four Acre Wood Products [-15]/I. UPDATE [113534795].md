1\. UPDATE

What transpired:

  


1\. Ran into a company called Cabinetry (had talked to Ian and had decided that it's not what they're looking for). At AirWorks at Mt Hope (showcase), ran into those guys, and Verlin looked at it, and it still might not be what they're looking for.

  


2\. Got exactly what they're looking for for the customer to price it, but they do not have the capability to send reports or to control who would be able to use what -- if he would pay for it and get it to the dealer, they could use it, and could pass it on to someone else.

  


3\. Should we slow down and consider it? The #1 problem with them is that they don't have live Internet there, they'd have to find someone else to do this thing for them, anyway. Crossed his mind, are we sure that we can't cabinetry -- and that we'd be the third party entering information into the cabinetry information? But would work three ways? And could we tie that together into a reporting program?

\- Built in a safety measure - daily backups up to 30 days

\- Order database is just a file, and just swap it out 

\- Track metrics around the number of times people log in, the number of orders in their system, -- bob has seen 400 orders and hasn't seen one

\- which of the designers are actually using the system -- and they're not logged in

\- we are in develop of Cabentry Cloud - the order database is cloud-based, and moving it from the here to the cloud - based on permission and security -- so that as the admin can see everyone, manufacturer can see everyone -- dealer/owner role who can see dealers in that area, or sales reps that serves these dealers

\- every single order whether you win it or not, and different statuses etc

\- 6 months out

\- building migration pass from current to cloud

  


\- caatalog is stored lcoally, then pushed to the cloud

\- when you open cabentry, looks in the cloud for an update, then downloads to the system

  


***

  


\- integration w/ QB

\- PowerBI integration - have successfully connected that to the database, will be able to create views of the database, so you can easily access the database

  


\- how many orders went out last night, and what was the sum of those.

I've got a question. How does your software work with multiple locations? When we make changes, do we need to update the catalogs for our dealers or does that happen automatically?

Myron has joined the chat!

Great question. When you say multiple locations, do you mean multiple dealers or multiple manufacturers?

Multiple dealers

Okay, and you are the manufacturer?

Yes

So you would create one catalog (which you can control), and then you can manage each specific dealers discount or multiplier to get them to their correct price.

All of your dealers access your one central catalog.

Got it. So it's a desktop application, but it shares the catalog via the Internet.

I was confused because it's a desktop application, so I wasn't sure how it was.

That is correct. We use a client based application to ensure that everything is blazing fast! And we are still able to keep your catalog current by pushing database updates.

Great! Do you all have any API available if we need to integrate with other systems?

We have integration with Cabinet Vision at this time and plan on adding more in the future.

It’s important to notes that we are a new company, we started in January 2019.

We now have a tram of 7 working full time on the product.

Ok. Are the all quotes from the dealers shared back to us, or just the ones they send over?

There are different options. Can we have a call to discuss?

Sure. 719-458-1650

Is now a good time for you or do you want to schedule a call?

Now's good.

One moment.
