Current pricing is done by the Item --

  


  * like a wall cabinet - W3042 (30 wide, 42 high) -  assume 12" deep if nothing else, $400 - basic, looking at the box, no cabinet doors, no wood ____ at this point
    * Matthias Miller 01/28/2020: Sizes -- every 3 inches from 6" through 60" \-- 
  * Flush Left/Right - /FRL
  * Flush Right - $25
  * Lighting, and those kinds of things that can be listed at that point.



  


  * SS3636
  * SR3636 -- means it's got shelves
  * etc etc



  


  * List all the cabinets, one-by-one-by-one, 



  


When you get into a large UT cabinet or Pantry cabinet - ie 24x108 - it might double or actually triple that, might 

  * It could be that you'd have to establish a SKU for each 



  


Matthias Miller 01/28/2020: 

  * Material and Labor
  * Another order sheet / catalog from another dealer
  * From another dealer - W4548-2B - the next line is finishing end L, and finishing end right - 12x48



  


  * We want to have different skus for the ends.



  


Matthias Miller 01/28/2020: 

  * This quote page gets used on a complete job
  * For example, if the wood is Walnut, space before the multiplication is after you've got all the cabinets listed, and then you list $10K * 45% = (oak, hickory, soft maple, are all base price).
  * Stain -- Glaze = 10% (no hinges, etc)
  * So some cabinets are not affected by wood type



  


Checkbox on SKUs on whether they respect WOOD and STAIN and DISTRESSING

  


  * Drawer guides -> list guides
  * Drawer Boxes - Dovetail - the drawer boxes



  


Drawer Front Raise -- might be 3-piece or might be 5-piece designs -- most times $150 for pricing, or if its a molding, it might be 200 or 250 --- could be going into thicker profiles or modlings

  


Matthias Miller 01/28/2020: They want it priced delivered, so they figure out a multiplier that's built-in.

  


Matthias Miller 01/28/2020: What he doesn't like about this system, is that they can send out pricing to a dealer, and they have cabinet number and a price out to the right -- does not include the hinges door, etc etc. -- preference 

  


  * Default to having the price of the stain, wood, and everything



  


This system has to work off-site (we have to manage some of it), he doesn't have live Internet -- his dealer has to be able to use it -- it would be awesome to be nice to have a paper for them to use -- but it's not the foremost goal -- so this can be Phase 2

  


  * The SKU is 3D is a 3-door cabinet - 3 drawers, 3 fronts, 3 sets of drawer guides



  


  * The wood species would be one of the first things to specify, if it recognizes the price of the cabinet with that wood species -- let's try hickory, and they've got $2K less, etc
  * Door hardware, and they don't do a lot of that -- some of the items, some of the things they hardly ever do...



  


  * Let's a say 48" cabinet -- 2 cabinets have 10" pulls, and another 18" base with a drawer box with a 4" pull, and the door might get a knob, maybe some of the doors get pulls  Matthias Miller 01/28/2020: Let's not add the specialty options at this point.



  


  


All of them wood have to be there -- the door hardware and the drawer hardware are not important. Drilling shouldn't be hard to add, it's not one that they use a lot, but they do use some of it, so that one should maybe stay there, and they use all the others.

  


Matthias Miller 01/28/2020: Say you have 2-3 people price the same job, because of the variables -- it would be awesome if they could overcome that in-house --
