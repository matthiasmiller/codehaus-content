1\. Overview

The Manufacturing / Production tools are required before we can integrate the sales process into Assist. This means being able to nail down the estimated delivery date, which will drive the rest of the process.

The goal is to develop the pull-through system based on Lean. When a customer purchases a building, they get an expected delivery date. If the customer can accept the delivery on that date, production continues as usual. If they can't take the building until later, it gets pushed down in the BPR so that it's built right before delivery. This puts logistics in control.

  


The BPR, referenced here, is the Builder Priority Report. It's the "source of truth" for builders to know what buildings they should build, and in which order.
