1\. Overview

  


Requirements

Tru-Haul provides delivery service to furniture stores to deliver furniture to customer homes. Tru-Haul currently uses an Access database distributed to each dealer for the pricing calculator. Tru-Haul is looking for an easy-to-use web-based interface that calculates the delivery cost based on distance, furniture value, furniture type, and dealer. 

  


Each dealer will have login access to the software. Prices should be configurable by dealer, but dealers should not be able to see other dealers' information.

  


CodeCrafters will deliver a customized software solution using the Silverloom Business Suite to provide an secure web-based portal for Tru-Haul's clients to use for shipping calculation. 

  


When dealers log in, they will be taken directly into the Calculator screen. Tru-Haul employees will have access to other settings and configuration screens.
