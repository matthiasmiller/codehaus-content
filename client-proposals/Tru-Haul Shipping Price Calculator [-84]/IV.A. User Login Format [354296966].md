4.1. User Login Format

  


Requirements

The Solution will use username / password login format. 

  


For dealers, the username and password will be specific to the dealer and can be shared across all of the dealer's locations for dealers with multiple sites.

  


Tru-Haul will control the list of user names and passwords.

  


Note that the test system uses the Google login format for easier access by CCI; if needed, this can also be changed to use the UN/PW format.
