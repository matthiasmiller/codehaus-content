4.3. Permissions

  


Requirements

The solution will include various custom permissions that control access to / visibility of various portions of the solution, including reports and records. These permissions are enabled on a per-User basis, allowing each User to only access their specific Calculator.

  


Two custom permissions are added:

  * View pricing information -- this gives access to see pricing inputs for all dealers, furniture types, and zones
  * Edit pricing information -- this allows modifying these pricing inputs



  


The table below lists the permissions in the solution and the User Groups that will have the corresponding permissions enabled.
