Ellis Miller 09/05/2024: I'm not sure we can do this. I'll have to talk with John Allan. We've had a lot of problems with resolution. Perhaps if we have very specific resolution it is an option, but I wonder about cloning these instead. We'll explore as part of implementation.

Tim Reitz 03/28/2025: Probably will need to use the new Thumbnail function. Jonathan said that this works well (we're using it for signatures for XFB).

_CCI: Tim Reitz 04/24/2025: This presumably needs to change, now that we are planning to use the new Thumbnail function. See the ZWA Multi-State feature.
