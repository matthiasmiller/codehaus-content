5.4. Deployment - Data Migration (Plan-specific)

Exiting data (clients, vehicles, etc.) is to be brought into the new Solution as part of deployment on a Plan-by-Plan basis. 

  


This section describes the process for the WI Group-specific Solution.

  


Data needed in the Solution will be hand-entered. This data migration is to be done by the WI Group, with support from CCI as needed. CCI can provide instructions for proper data entry, including the correct sequence for setting up different records. 

  


The following data is to be migrated into the Solution as part of deployment: 

  * Congregations
  * Clients
  * Agents
  * Vehicles



  


Claims will not be migrated as part of deployment, though this may be done by the WI Group if desired.
