1\. Overview

  


Requirements

The Weaverland Vehicle Aid of Wisconsin (WVAWI) organization is a self-insurance aid plan providing vehicle coverage to members of the Weaverland Mennonite Conference in the state of Wisconsin. As of the time of this proposal, WVAWI serves more than 600 member-clients with over 1,500 total vehicles, and is growing quickly in size. WVAWI currently keeps records by hand on paper, but is looking for a software solution to improve record-keeping and management. 

  


This proposal is for the work of preparing, deploying, and maintaining a WVAWI-specific "instance" of the existing Self-Insured Vehicle Management Silverloom Solution (SIVM), initially designed for and provided to the Weaverland Mennonite Vehicle Aid Plan of Pennsylvania.

Tim Reitz 03/14/2025: The main proposal for the Multi-State changes is now at [https://zch.apphosting.zone/Detail/Edit/2?RecordType=ClientProposals&NumberID=-100&](https://zch.apphosting.zone/Detail/Edit/2?RecordType=ClientProposals&NumberID=-100&).
