7\. Summary of Operating Agreement

Base Solution: 

WMVAP (the PA Group) remains the majority stakeholder client of the SIVM Solution, maintaining the final call on changes made to the portion of the Solution that is shared across all Groups (the “Base Solution”). 

  


As other Groups wish to use the SIVM Solution, CCI will work with each Group to set up their own instance of the Solution. Each Group is responsible for paying the setup fee to CCI. The PA Group may work out compensation details with the other Groups, either individually or collectively, outside of CCI's dealings with the Groups.  

  


Ongoing Use: 

  * Each Group will run off of its own instance of the SIVM Solution, accessed via their own website subdomain. 
  * CCI will work with and bill each Group individually for monthly / annual maintenance contracts, user fees, client support, etc. 
  * Regarding changes to the SIVM Solution: 
    * Changes to the Base Solution: 
      * Changes normally would be made to the Base Solution, applying to all Groups. 
      * For smaller changes, CCI will work primarily with WMVAP to design and approve the changes, then alert the other Groups as necessary. If another Group requests a minor change, CCI would work with both that Group and WMVAP. 
      * For larger changes, CCI would work with both WMVAP and representatives from other Groups as needed. 
      * WMVAP, as the primary client/partner, makes the final decision for changes to the Base Solution. 
      * CCI normally will bill WMVAP for changes to the Base Solution, and WMVAP can then work out cost sharing with the other Group(s). 
        * However, if one or more other Groups wish to make a change to the Base Solution that WMVAP does not wish to pay for, the other Group(s) may pay for those changes themselves. 
    * Changes to individual versions of the Solution: 
      * Each Group may make changes to their own version of the Solution. 
      * When a Group requests changes to their version of the Solution, CCI may determine that the change would benefit other Groups or the Base Solution, and may refer the change to WMVAP as a possible change to the Base Solution. 
      * Changes made to a Group-specific Solution are to be billed to the specific Group making the change.
