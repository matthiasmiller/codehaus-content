6.1. Adding the Silverloom Accounting Module

The Silverloom Accounting Module could be added to the Solution and customized to integrate with Invoices, etc. A user login account could be created for a CPA to perform financial audits. 

  


As with other changes, details for this are being discussed outside of this proposal.
