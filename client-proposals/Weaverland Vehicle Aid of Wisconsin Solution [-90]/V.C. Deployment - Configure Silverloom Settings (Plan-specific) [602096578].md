5.3. Deployment - Configure Silverloom Settings (Plan-specific)

The following Silverloom Settings are to be configured as part of deployment on a Plan-by-Plan basis. These are to be done as a joint effort between the CCI support team and the Plan.

  


This section describes the process for the WI Group-specific Solution.

[X] Set up / confirm the Contact Settings details

_CLIENT: Tim Reitz 08/22/2025: I see your dec page says, "We provide uninsured motorist coverage with a maximum limit of $25,000 for one person and $50,000 for two or more people for bodily injury coverage. 

TODO_TR: Ben Reitz 10/24/2025: They do have uninsured coverage, but it's set up the same as the liability coverages. So we need to figure out how the system should handle that.

[ ] Set up the New Member Card Printout details

Note: The WI group does not need the New Member Card printout at this time, so the memo in Silverloom Settings will be left blank (and the "Print" link on the Contact record will be hidden as long as the memo is blank).

[X] Set up the Claim General Release Printout details

[ ] Set up the Plan-Specific Settings details - TODO_CLIENT

[ ] Set up Guidelines Compliance questions - TODO_CLIENT

[X] Confirm the Agent Change Notice Printout details
