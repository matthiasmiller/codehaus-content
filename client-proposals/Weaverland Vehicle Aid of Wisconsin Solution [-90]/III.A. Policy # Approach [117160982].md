3.1. Policy # Approach

WVAWI functions with one policy number for each member/client. 

  


The details are configured in the System Switch by CCI before/at deployment, and an individual # is assigned to each client. 

  


The number will have the following properties:

  * Prefixed with "SI"
  * Contains 7 digits after the prefix
  * Based off of the Contact ID for the Plan member, with zeros added to the front of the ID number as needed to reach a total of 7 numeric digits.
    * Note that the numbering may start at 0 or at any other number above that (based on the "Max contact ID num:" System Switch - see the Plan-specific System Switch section of the proposal).
  * The numeric portion increases sequentially with each new member and cannot be edited.
  * The full policy # is displayed throughout the Solution and on printouts in the following format "SI0000001"
