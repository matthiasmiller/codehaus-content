5\. Deployment (All Plans)

CodeCrafters will provide support and training for users, especially the admins, throughout the deployment of the software. This may include Zoom calls, recorded video walk-throughs, phone calls, emails, technical support, in-person work, etc. 

  


Admin users may be given access to the dedicated test system prior to/during deployment to allow for practicing and learning the system.
