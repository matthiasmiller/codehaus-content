11\. Future work

The following future enhancements will be considered while implementing the initial software. They may be included in the initial work.

  


Personal storage space

Create a special storage space, limited to the user, where private information such as legal or financial documents can be stored.

  


Weather reporting

Given a zip code, the system will send a fax with the weather forecast. This can be requested on demand or sent on a schedule.

  


Automated spreadsheets

The system would allow keeping track of shared spreadsheets used for recording inventory, etc.

  


  


The following enhancements would not be included in the initial work, but would be later possibilities.

  


Contacts Rolodex

The system would allow storing, searching, and retrieving contacts. Information would include name, phone number, contact type, etc.

  


  


Production entry

The system would allow individual builders to report their daily production by entering the invoice numbers in the system.

  


Color faxes

The system would allow sending faxes not only in black & white, but also color directly. By using a service with greater capacity, color faxes would be delivered much more quickly.

  


Fax logging

The system could accept a fax to be sent to another number. It would store the fax for retrieval at another time.

  


Calendar

The system would have dated entries, and automatically add them to the users' daily checklists.

  


Business dashboard

A daily dashboard report would be sent from the software that would combine multiple metrics:

  * Sales information
  * Production information
  * Key financial information from Quickbooks.
