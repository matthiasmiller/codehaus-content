1\. Overview

  


Requirements

Golden Rule Lumber is currently using Classic Accounting (CA). However, they are running into issues with sales tax tracking. CA also does not allow them to fax or email invoices, and it does not have a streamlined way to manage inventory. Finally, CA does not allow them to expand their software for additional features and capabilites.

  


The ideal solution would be to replace CA completely with a solution that works just as well, or better. This has to fit within the bounds of what's possible with the Steward or Choreboy.

  


The "worst case scenario" (apart from things staying as they are) is having additional systems that simply feed into CA.

  


CodeCrafters provides Silverloom, a robust business software solution with customizable modules for accounting, inventory management, scheduling, and more. Silverloom is currently provided as a cloud solution. CodeCrafters has experience building a bridge between the Silverloom database solution and Classic word processors. This could be leveraged to create a full customized software solution accessible on the Steward. It would require a Raspberry Pi on the client's network with a data connection to the Silverloom servers. Because of the complexity of providing software within the LibreOffice framework, this solution is significantly more expensive than a native SIlverloom solution.

  


Development Specification

TODO_BR - If they want to talk to someone using the Silverloom bridge, let's talk about putting them in touch with Mark about it.
