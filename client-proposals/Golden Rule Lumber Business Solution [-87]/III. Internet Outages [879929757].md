3\. Internet Outages

If we end up doing any kind of bridge, we will need to handle potential Internet outages. GRL has had maybe a half day of downtime across the past 4 years. When the Internet goes down, the phones go down.

  


This can be handled a few ways:

  * Get a redundant cellular data connection (potential bandwidth issues with VOIP lines)
  * Get a redundant Internet connection with a secondary provider
  * Build in partial usability when the system is offline.



  


In the end, we may end up with #3 inherently if we do the work needed to make this be as usable as possible for data entry.
