2.4. Solution 4 - Hybrid - Classic Accounting + Silverloom

If Classic Accounting proves to be adequate for a short-term accounting solution, additional tools and features could be built out to integrate Silverloom, Classic Accounting, and LibreOffice spreadsheets.

  


In short, this solution would be a combination of Solution 1 and Solution 3, except that all accounting would be in Classic Accounting. This would allow additional features such as inventory management and scheduling to be built out alongside Classic Accounting.

  


  * Move POs and VIs into Silverloom
  * Extract items from Invoices & Sales Receipts in CA and make inventory adjustments in Silverloom



  


Pros:

  * No extensive work required to migrate accounting
  * Access to new Silverloom features
  * Access to updated Sales Tax rates
  * Lower initial investment
  * Allows a short-term, lower-cost investment that provides immediate benefit while exploring and allowing for the option of completely replacing Classic Accounting 



  


Cons:

  * Still remain dependent on Classic Accounting for changes / enhancements



  


Price:

  * Initial Development - $40k to $100k
  * Maintenance - $7k to $15k/mo
