2.5. Honorable Mentions

The following options are worth mentioning, if only for the sake of widening our perspective.

  * Build a bridge with another ERP such as ECI Spruce or Epicore (unclear how much integration is possible)
  * Build a full replacement for Classic Accounting that runs natively in LibreOffice Base (expensive option)
