2.2. Solution 2 - Silverloom-Powered Word Processor

This is very similar to Solution 1, except that it's a Word Process that is restricted to only run the Silverloom business software. It could optionally include LibreOffice and other approved software that the Classic word processors use. It would also rely on a data connection. Note that this would not have to be Windows; it could be Linux or Android.

  


Pros:

  * Access to full Silverloom suite
  * Significantly better user interface and ease-of-access than LibreOffice
  * Lower-cost for additional features
  * Lower-cost maintenance
  * Significantly less expensive than Solution 1 with the same benefits



  


Cons:

  * Requires community approval



  


Cost:

  * Initial Investment: Estimated $100k - $150k
  * Maintenance: $15k - $25k per year
