Requirements

We will enter the information for #460, which you provided. This will give you an example that you can model after. However, we will not enter information for any other pieces of furniture.

  


We will also need access to your computer via TeamViewer or a similar tool.

  


You will be responsible for maintaining a backup. Because we are entering information, we can set up your system again. However, you will not have access to old cut lists or to any updates you've made to your products.
