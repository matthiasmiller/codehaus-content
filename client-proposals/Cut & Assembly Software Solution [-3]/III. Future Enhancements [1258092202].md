3\. Future Enhancements

In the future, we would like to make some possible enhancements. These enhancements are NOT part of the proposal, and these details could change before we are ready to implement them. However, I am including these details for future reference.

  


Automatic Stops

Eventually, it would be nice to be able to integrate the software solution with the automatic stop. Whenever we choose to do this, we should evaluate not only the cost of the automatic stop but also the cost of integration with a custom software solution.

  


As part of our preliminary research, I spoke with Mike Arnott (913-660-2350) from TigerStop. While TigerStop is a more expensive solution, here are the options for integrating TigerStop into our solution.

  


TigerLink (recommended). This is a $1080 addon to your TigerStop, but it will be your least expensive solution. Here's how it will work:

  


  * Once you've set up the cut list, you will download a cut list from our software.
  * You will open TigerLink (TigerStop software installed on your computer), then open the cut list from step 1.
  * TigerLink will send this cut list to the TigerStop.
  * You will be able to use the TigerStop controller, which will show the description (size + color) of the material you're cutting.



  


As long as the TigerStop controller meets your needs, I encourage you to use this option. This allows us to add the feature to the software now, allowing you to purchase the TigerStop when it's right for you and your business.

  


Serial Connection. This allows you to connect your TigerStop to the computer and allow the software to directly control it. While this is only a $640 add-on to your TigerStop, it requires that the software directly control the TigerStop.

  


This may be a good option if you'd like to have a tablet to control the TigerStop. However, I don't recommend it as long as the TigerStop controller meets your needs.

  


TigerStop Tablet. This is a $3695 TigerStop addon, which includes both of the previous options. In addition, it allows you to control the TigerStop using the tablet. If the TigerStop controller doesn't meet your needs, we should consider whether it's more cost-effective to design our own tablet that integrates into the system, or whether it's better to use the TigerStop tablet.

  


As long as the TigerStop controller meets your needs, I recommend against purchasing the TigerStop tablet.

  


Workstations

At some point, we would like to upgrade the software to provide workstations for the assemblers. At this time, there's only a single jig for each chair, we don't need to worry about assemblers trying to build the same chair.

  


Most likely, we would assign certain pieces of furniture to be assembled primarily by a specific assembler, while allowing each assembler to view all pieces of furniture needing to be assembled.
