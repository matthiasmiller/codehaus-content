1\. Overview

CodeCrafters created the EITC system for FaithBuilders in 2018, and created a separate SPE system in 2021. Currently school data is entered in the EITC system and is subsequently exported to the SPE system for donor applications. Using separate systems makes donor recognition (postcard program) difficult and time-consuming, and prevents further integration of the system.

  


CodeCrafters will create a unified FaithBuilders scholarship system, with separate modules for EITC and SPE.

This system will provide the foundation for ongoing enhancements, such as web portals, and will reduce hosting costs by $100 per month.
