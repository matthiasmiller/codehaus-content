15.2. Website

  


Requirements

TractorHouse currently hosts the Ed's Machinery website. They do not allow other bidding platforms to be advertised on their hosted websites. Although TractorHouse has added redundant servers to mitigate this issue, it might make sense to integrate this solution into the main website.

  


Ed's Machinery would use another marketing company such as Black Anvil Creative ([https://blackanvilmedia.com/](https://blackanvilmedia.com/)) or Rosewood ([https://rosewood.us.com/](https://rosewood.us.com/)) for the majority of the website. They would provide a place on the website to embed the inventory listing, and could link to that webpage with preset filtering options.

  


This would require the following items:

  * Add the following fields to Equipment:
    * Equipment Category (i.e. Ag Equipment, Construction Equipment, Trucks & Trailers)
    * Ag Category (i.e. Tractors, Harvestors, Hay & Forage Equipment, etc)
    * Ag Subcategory (i.e. Round Balers, Square Balers, Mowers, Rakes, Other)
  * Allow sorting by price (default high-to-low, but allow low-to-high)
  * Allow filtering by:
    * Any categories
    * Location (if multiple locations are supported)
  * Allow text search



  


In addition to the standard listing information and photos, it should show an Email Seller link and form.

  


This feature is roughly ballparked at $30,000, but more work is needed to determine more details and a more accurate price.

  


Development Specification

We will price this out right away, but they might not want to do development for 2 years.

Tim Reitz 09/12/2023: Matthias's ballpark estimate: $30,000
