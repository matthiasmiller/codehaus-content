Standard Questions for Each Design: 

  


DONE_HLD: Include questions and answers that were asked in the "Various Questions" email in [[[W0312](https://zch.apphosting.zone/Detail/Edit/2?RecordType=WikiPages&NumberID=-313&)]] - 13. High-Level Design Prep Emails: 

1\. On a scale of 1 to 10, how important is it to access the software from a mobile device, such as a phone or tablet? I would say it would be a 10.

Tim Reitz 08/24/2023: I'm adding a Mobile Support section to the proposal for this discussion.

  


2\. Do you want to import data from an existing software system or spreadsheets? If yes, what data (i.e. contacts, sales items, invoices, etc.)?  Possibly will be needing to import data from Google Sheets

Tim Reitz 08/24/2023: Adding notes to Data Migration section.

  


3\. We offer two options for login format: A quick login using Gmail/Google accounts, and a username/password login. It can also be set up so that some users use one and others use the other. Which format would you prefer? We should be able to use a Gmail/Google account.

Tim Reitz 08/24/2023: Noted.

  


4\. Will you want to restrict access to certain portions of the system from some users? If so, you can be thinking through what groups of users you will want to have and what portions of the system you would like them to be able to access. Yes, we would be needing to restrict access to certain users.

Tim Reitz 08/24/2023: Noted. 

  


5\. Do you want to use time tracking for employees? Yes

Tim Reitz 08/24/2023: Noted & added sections.

  


6\. What would you like to call the software solution? Sometimes our clients refer to it with a generic term such as "CRM system" or "our software", but some clients like to give their solution a more specific name. It's nice to give it a name or description that is and easy to use. We don't need this right away, but you can be thinking about this as we get started on the design. Not sure yet
