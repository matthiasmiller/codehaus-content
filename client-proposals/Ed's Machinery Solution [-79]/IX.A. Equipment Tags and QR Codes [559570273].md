9.1. Equipment Tags and QR Codes

  


Requirements

The equipment tags need to last 2-3 years without peeling or fading.

  


Because of the commission labels and in the interest of adding the make and model, it would be best to be able to print them in-house.

  


The solution will generate a PDF that can be used for equipment tags. It will generate a PDF showing:

  


  * The Ed's Machinery logo and contact information
  * A custom QR code (linking to a URL such like [https://app.edsmachinery.com/12345](https://app.edsmachinery.com/12345)  or [https://eds.wsgi.apphosting.zone/12345](https://eds.wsgi.apphosting.zone/12345))
  * The stock number
  * The make and model
  * The auction date it's consigning for (if it's a consignment piece)



  


NOTE: We will research labels, printers, and costs during the in-depth design. If we discover that we can print them in-house, we can facilitate a workflow to print them on-demand. This would allow us to print additional information on the tag, such as the lead text.

  


Development Specification

TODO_IDD - This can either be implemented through a WSGI or through a parse function.
