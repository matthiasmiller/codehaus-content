1\. Overview

Ed's Machinery is a machine shop in Memphis, MO, that specializes in buying and selling used farm equipment. They buy the equipment from dealers and auctions, do any cleaning or repairs as needed, and then sell either from their lot or from their own auctions. They also sell some items on consignment via sales. Ed's Machinery is looking to create a better inventory management system through this solution.

  


This will create efficiency and eliminate confusion with the large amount of inventory they are managing.

  


For example, this will:

  * Allow team members to scan a QR code to quickly and easily enter information
  * Allow the team to view costs and profit margin on a per-equipment basis
  * Allow customers to view listings by scanning a QR code



  


Ed's Machinery has three primary buyers for acquiring equipment for resale. After they secure a piece of equipment, then:

  * The secretary will create an inventory item in QuickBooks, assign a stock number, and enter the best description available at the time. Then, she will enter the bill into QuickBooks and pay it. This will automatically get pushed to the AppHosting system.
  * The equipment gets a sticker with the Stock Number and a QR code. It goes through the wash bay, gets inspected, and is repaired.
  * A shop team member scans the QR code and uploads the supporting documentation (time and costs) by taking pictures of the documents with their phone. This creates an alert for the office staff. They will enter this information into the AppHosting solution.
  * The salesperson scans the QR code and uploads pictures of the equipment to the AppHosting solution. Once they're back at the desk, they upload it to TractorHouse.
