9\. Uploading Prints to the Order

Once the designer completes PDF file for an individual request, he will click an Upload link that will open a new page where he can either browse for the print or drag it onto the page. He can close the tab to return to the prior page, check the "Complete" checkbox for that request (at which point the Truss Prints memo becomes read-only), then save the page. 

  


Once a request has been marked complete, that corresponding print would be available on the main order (but the salesperson would not get the alert until the full batch of requests is complete). 

  


When the designer has completed all requests for a quote/order, the alert for the salesperson would be triggered and the order would be considered complete for the designer (it would no longer show up as incomplete on his report).
