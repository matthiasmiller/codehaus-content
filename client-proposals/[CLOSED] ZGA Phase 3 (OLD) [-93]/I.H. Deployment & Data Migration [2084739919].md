1.8. Deployment & Data Migration

CodeCrafters / CodeHaus will provide support and training for users, especially the admins, throughout the deployment of the customizations. This may include Zoom calls, recorded video walkthroughs, phone calls, emails, technical support, etc. 

  


This proposal assumes a total of up to 5 hours of deployment support & training time. No data migration is anticipated. Additional time beyond that may be billed on a per-hour / T&M basis. 

  


Admin users may be given access to the dedicated test system prior to / during deployment to allow for practicing and learning the system. 

  


Deployment details: 

The following items are to be configured by CCI/CH at deployment (see corresponding sections of the proposal for additional details): 

  * Service Location Categories list
  * Incident Stage configuration records
