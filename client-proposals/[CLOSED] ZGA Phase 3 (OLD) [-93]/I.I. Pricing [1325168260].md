Development Disclaimer 

We have done multiple levels of review to ensure that the proposal is accurate and complete. However, in cases where technical limitations are encountered for a specific detail, an alternate design may be implemented in consultation with the client.

  


Maintenance & Support

CodeCrafters provides ongoing maintenance and support for systems. This includes phone and email support, ongoing platform enhancements, as well as maintenance and fixes for the custom software solution. Standard support includes answering general questions and supporting standard use of the product. If a request goes beyond standard support, requiring additional customization or premium support, we will offer you that option. The maintenance can be paid on a monthly or an annual basis. This cost of the maintenance agreement is based on the size of the customization and the support required for the solution. Note that the Maintenance & Support cost will increase as the solution grows with additional customizations. 

  


Changes and Enhancements

When deploying the system, CodeCrafters will provide you an opportunity to use the system and provide feedback on features. CodeCrafters will attempt to integrate requested changes as part of the project. If requests (either during deployment or during ongoing use after deployment) go beyond the scope of the project, CodeCrafters will discuss with you how these should be prioritized.
