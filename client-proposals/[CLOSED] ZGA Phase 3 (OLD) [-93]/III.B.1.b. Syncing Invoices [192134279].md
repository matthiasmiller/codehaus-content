Had a meeting with our team here discussing the options we have for dealing with parts and how to sort them to fit in our invoice format. We discussed the options we had came up with on the call and took some time to brainstorm about what would really serve the purpose for us.

We came up with an idea for a third option I would like to present and see how it would look from your perspective.

 

For parts ordered specific to an incident we would like to do that inside each child incident. This would be a field similar to Shop Supplies. We would need an editable list of items to select from. A quantity field, An editable price field (price would be attached to item and would auto fill but be changeable), and a field to select the vendor.

 

To order parts we would open the incident, select part from the list(create a new item if needed), enter quantity, update price, and select vendor

 

That would put the parts directly in the incident for invoicing sorting.

 

Could we then have App hosting create a PO from all parts entered in incidents since the last PO was created for each vendor whenever we are ready to place the order? (We would need a place to select which vendor or vendors we are ready to create a PO for)

We would then send that PO to our vendor as our order. We would also need to receive the vendors bill against the PO in App Hosting since Quick Books knows nothing of the PO.

This would put all the invoice data in App Hosting. When we are ready to create an invoice we would push the invoice into Quick books.

Another feature to add would be pricing rules per vendor, to set the markup percentage from entered prices

 

We would also need to push the bills into Quick books for accounting at some point.  

 

This is an overview of what we dreamed up! Hopefully it makes at least a bit of sense. Let me know what for questions this generates! Thanks!
