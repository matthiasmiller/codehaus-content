5.1.1. Daily Service Run Numbers

  


Requirements

This is a non-editable simple list used to track Daily Service Run Numbers. It includes the following items: 

  


  * 1
  * 2
  * 3
  * 4
  * 5
  * 6
  * 7
  * 8
  * 9



  


This list is universal for all users.

  


Note that this sequence is static, so it should always be displayed in this sequence throughout the Solution.

  


This list will be set up by CCI as part of the main development. If changes need to be made to this list, it will require some coding work.

  


Ellis Miller 11/01/2023: _CH: We can delete this. We'll make it look like a list, but use a calculated list under the hood.

: Tim Reitz 11/01/2023: Ok, sure. What documentation should we have for it?

Ellis Miller 11/06/2023: Just document this on the Time Card section. "The Svc Run will display a drop list with options from 1 to 9."
