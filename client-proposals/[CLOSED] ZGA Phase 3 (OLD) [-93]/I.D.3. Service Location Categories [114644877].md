This is a non-editable simple list used to track Service Location Categories. It includes the following items:

  * Service Truck



  


This list is universal for all users.

  


Note that this sequence is static, so it should always be displayed in this sequence throughout the Solution.

  


This list will be set up by CCI as part of the main development. If changes need to be made to this list, it will require some coding work.
