2.1. Workflow for Setting up an Event

  


Requirements

*Documented 

  


The following is a basic overview for managing an Event record:

  


Creating the Event record:

  * Click one of the following, either on the Admin menu or on an Events report:
    * New Industry Forum
    * New Info Meeting
    * New Launch Meeting
    * New Annual Summit
  * Enter required details, and any other desired details, and save the new record.



  


Registering people for the Event:

  * Note that registrations are tracked on a special "Event Registration" record that is linked to both the registrant's Contact record and the Event record. This means that any registrant must have a Contact record in the Solution.
  * To create individual registrations for Events, click on one of the following to create a new Event Registration record, then manually set additional fields as desired: 
    * Click the "Add Event" link in the "Event Registration" section of the Contact record (the Contact is set on the prompt)
    * Click the "Register for Info Meeting" link in the "Lead Details" section of the Contact record (the Contact is set on the prompt)
    * Click the "Register for Launch Meeting" link in the "Lead Details" section of the Contact record (the Event and Contact name are set on the prompt)
    * Click the "Add Registrant" link in "Registration Details" section of the Event record (the Event is set on the prompt)
  * To batch-create registrations for a Launch Meeting, click on the "Create Registrations from Info Meeting" link on the Launch Meeting record. This creates Event Registration records for all registrants for the Info Meeting who need them, with multiple fields defaulted. 



  


Marking an Event as Completed: 

  * Once all Event Registrations for an Event have attendance information set, the Event can be marked as Complete.
