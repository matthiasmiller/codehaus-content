Requirements

*Documented 

  


Make the following changes to User Notifications (changes indicated with blue / strike-through):

  


Note that this proposal does not include any confirmation or reminder notifications/emails for the registrants, as these were not discussed in the design process. However, these could be added at a future date and the emails could contain the .ics calendar invites.

  


Development Specification

Tim Reitz 06/28/2024: We don't have any spec for a Registration Confirmation email to the registrant [or any reminders or cancelation notices]. We should ask the client if they want that. Maybe should save it for a future item. 

Tim Reitz 07/01/2024: CR written up: [[[IN10183](https://zch.apphosting.zone/Detail/Edit/2?RecordType=Incidents&NumberID=-10185&)]] - ZSB - User Notifications - Add Events-related Notifications. 

  


  


Tim Reitz 06/20/2024: If calendar / date based, it's a report alert. If it's record / action based, it's a real-time notification.
