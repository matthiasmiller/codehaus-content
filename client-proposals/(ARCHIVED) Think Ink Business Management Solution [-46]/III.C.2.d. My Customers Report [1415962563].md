Requirements

The My Customers report is the same as the All Customers report, simply filtered down to show all the customers for the current logged-in user (all of the customers for which this user is set as the "Sales Rep") and all customers with a blank "Sales Rep" field.

  


This is accessed from a "My Customers" menu option on the Home Menu.
