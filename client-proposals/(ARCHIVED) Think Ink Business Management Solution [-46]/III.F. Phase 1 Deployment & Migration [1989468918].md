3.6. Phase 1 Deployment & Migration

  


Requirements

TODO_CH: Tim Reitz 02/16/2023: archive this section (I think).

  


The Badger import and cleanup process will be done by Think Ink with guidance and assistance from CCI/CH. The proposal includes 4 hours of time by CCI/CH. Additional time will be billed on a per-hour basis.

  


The import of Classic Accounting Contacts is provided in a separate change by adding Classic Accounting's Unique ID for the contacts. This Classic Accounting sync will be enhanced in Phase 2.

  


Development Specification

CCI: Or should we bring the Badger migration in-house as well and charge X for it (or charge hourly) to avoid getting sucked into it? Or should we budget Y hours to help (and document that # in the proposal), and charge hourly beyond that?

  


I think we bring it in-house with X hours of migration time included (and listed on proposal) and an hourly rate for additional time.

DONE_CCI: Tim Reitz 06/21/2022: Just to clarify, are we assisting the client (as the Requirements says) or are we doing this in-house (as the Dev Spec note above says)?

Tim Reitz 06/22/2022: Per Ellis, we're doing as the Requirements says.
