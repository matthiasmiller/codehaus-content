13.2.2. Changes to Contacts for Phase 4

  * Invoices (standard section, with the following customizations): 
    * Total Uninvoiced Fees (auto-calculated and read-only; sum of all uninvoiced fees for base charges and page count overages)
    * Create Invoice for Fees (button; creates an invoice for all uninvoiced fees for the customer) 
    * more?
    * 


  


  * Customer Details (custom section): 
    * Autopay (checkbox; defaults to cleared; if filled, set the customer to automatically pay invoices; if filled, ensure that the customer has a card on file; ___



DONE_CH: thoughts on how this should work?

TODO_TR: Reply to Austin's comment in mockups. 

TODO_TR: Add an "Payments" link or something similar that allows managing cards on file, as well as running specific charges for specific invoices. This will go to an integration (specifics TBD).

  * Invoice Terms (auto-fill and read-only; synced from Classic Accounting; would automatically apply to all invoices for the that customer)



  


  * Possible future feature: Add one or more flags to track things such as
    * Top 100 customers by revenue
    * Purchased a printer last month
    * 3 consecutive months over print count allotment 



etc.

  


TODO_IDD: Tim Reitz 07/27/2023: Maybe change Contact Types away from "CUST" and "VEND" if we're not syncing with CA anymore.
