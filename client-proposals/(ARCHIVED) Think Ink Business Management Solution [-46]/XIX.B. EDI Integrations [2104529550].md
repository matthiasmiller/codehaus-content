19.2. EDI Integrations

TODO_CH: From client on 4/7: 

I am digging into integrations things a little. Below are 2 sites I marked of EDI integration partners. I am not sure have you done EDI stuff before, but I believe it is definitely something we want to look into.

Tim Reitz 04/19/2022: How far should we go with this at this point? This seems to pertain to the drop-shipping feature that he was thinking of as a future possibility (see Future Possibilities). The client was fine with simply having it be a consideration at this point.
