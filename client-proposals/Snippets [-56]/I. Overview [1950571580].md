1\. Overview

The snippets module allows creating templates that can be added to

  * Client Proposals
  * Contact Notes
  * Incidents



  


These templates can reference expressions to make them conditionally visible. They can also reference information from the record or from other records in the database.

  


Each memo has a Snippet drop list. To append, select the Snippet and click the Append button.
