2.4. Changes for the Resources Menu Section

*Documentation N/A

  


Main Menu: "Resources" section: The current "behind the scenes" format for most of the resources accessed from this menu section is changing:

  * The Handbook currently is stored in a special Handbook record. This is moving to a Wiki page, and the Handbook record and "Configure Handbook" menu option are being removed.
  * The information for Allowed Vehicles, Truck Weight Chart, and Vehicle Guideline Sheet are stored on Wiki pages. This is staying the same.
  * Admins currently can go to the Silverloom Settings to choose which Wiki page to link to each of these 3 menu options. This selection is moving to System Switches, to give more customization over the names and behaviors of the menu options:
    * Up to 10 customized menu options can be configured.
    * The following can be configured for each menu option:
      * Menu label (plain text field) 
      * Wiki page to pull from (manually set via a plain text field) 
      * Action (options for "View Page" / "Page to PDF" / "View Attached File") 
        * Note that "View Attached File" opens the top uploaded file in the Wiki page memo. 
  * The "Wiki" link opens the Wiki report. This is moving to a new "Wiki" section on the Admin menu.
  * The "Insurance Card (Back)" is stored on file in the database. This format is staying the same, and will remain as a special link at the top of the Resources list (with the customizable items below it). The label is changing to "Print Insurance Card (Back)".
