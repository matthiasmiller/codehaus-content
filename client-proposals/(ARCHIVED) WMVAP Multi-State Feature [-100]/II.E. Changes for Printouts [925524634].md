2.5. Changes for Printouts

*Documentation N/A

  


Printouts: Significant changes are being made to printout templates, to replace hard-coded details that are specific to the PA Group with expressions that conditionally display Plan-specific details based on System Switches and Silverloom Settings. This allows printouts to be configured on a Plan-by-Plan basis.
