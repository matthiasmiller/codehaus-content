3.5. Changes to Printouts

  


Requirements

*Documented. Tim Reitz 08/19/2025

  


The Solution generates various printouts, which can be either "basic" or "customized". Unless otherwise noted, all printouts contain the standard "Powered by Silverloom Business Suite" footer.

  


Basic printouts can be generated from the Advanced menu of a report. Note that the PDF versions of such printouts can be branded with the Plan logo and contact information, but do not have any additional special customizations. Basic Excel files do not include the logo/branding.

  


Customized printouts are provided for various reports and/or records. CodeCrafters will take some liberty with the design of these printouts to simplify development and to compensate for technical limitations. Customized PDFs can include a custom letterhead, and customized Excel printout/files can include the logo.

  


Development Specification

Tim Reitz 08/27/2024: Add a small "Powered by Silverloom Business Suite" footer to all printouts templates (even if not mentioned in this proposal, like the Invoice printout). Discuss with Ellis to confirm specific format/size/etc.

Ellis Miller 09/05/2024: will do in each of the jobs. Thinking it's something like 8 point font.
