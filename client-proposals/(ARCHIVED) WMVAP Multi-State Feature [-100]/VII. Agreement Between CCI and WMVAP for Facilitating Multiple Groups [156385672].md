7\. Agreement Between CCI and WMVAP for Facilitating Multiple Groups

*Documented. Tim Reitz 09/05/2025: [[[IN12152](https://zch.apphosting.zone/Detail/Edit/2?RecordType=Incidents&NumberID=-12154&)]] - Agreement Between CCI and WMVAP for Facilitating Multiple Groups 

  


Introduction: This describes the agreement between WMVAP and CCI regarding the Self-Insured Vehicle Management (“SIVM”) software solution provided by CCI via the Silverloom Business Suite, specifically regarding the licensing of the SIVM Solution by other self-insurance groups (“Groups”) within the larger Weaverland Mennonite Conference. 

  


Note that a separate agreement probably would be established if an organization outside of the Weaverland Mennonite Conference would wish to use the SIVM Solution, due to the likelihood of more differences in functionality needs. 

  


Initial Development / Changes to Facilitate Multiple Groups: 

  * WMVAP remains the majority stakeholder client of the SIVM Solution, maintaining the final call on changes made to the portion of the Solution that is shared across all Groups (the “Base Solution”). 
  * CCI is working directly with the Weaverland Vehicle Aid of Wisconsin organization (“WI Group”,) as well as the WVAMP, to code the changes to the base Solution needed to allow multiple Groups to use it. 
  * CCI will bill the WMVAP for the cost of making these changes. 
  * WMVAP may work out compensation details with the WI Group and other groups, outside of this agreement with CCI. 
  * CCI would work with the WI Group directly for setting up their copy of the Solution, including invoicing them for the initial setup fee to  CCI (currently $7,500, but the fee amount may change over time). 
  * If one or more other Groups wish to join at this point, each Group would have their own copy of the Solution and each would pay the setup fee. 



  


Ongoing Use: 

  * Each Group will run off of its own copy of the SIVM Solution, accessed via their own website subdomain. 
  * CCI will work with and bill each Group individually for monthly / annual maintenance contracts, user fees, client support, etc. 
  * Regarding changes to the SIVM Solution: 
    * Changes to the Base Solution: 
      * Changes normally would be made to the Base Solution, applying to all Groups. 
      * For smaller changes, CCI will work primarily with WMVAP to design and approve the changes, then alert the other Groups as necessary. If another Group requests a minor change, CCI would work with both that Group and WMVAP. 
      * For larger changes, CCI would work with both WMVAP and representatives from other Groups as needed. 
      * WMVAP, as the primary client/partner, makes the final decision for changes to the Base Solution. 
      * CCI normally will bill WMVAP for changes to the Base Solution, and WMVAP can then work out cost sharing with the other Group(s). 
        * However, if one or more other Groups wish to make a change to the Base Solution that WMVAP does not wish to pay for, the other Group(s) may pay for those changes themselves. 
    * Changes to individual versions of the Solution: 
      * Each Group may make changes to their own version of the Solution. 
      * When a Group requests changes to their version of the Solution, CCI may determine that the change would benefit other Groups or the Base Solution, and may refer the change to WMVAP as a possible change to the Base Solution. 
      * Changes made to a Group-specific Solution are to be billed to the specific Group making the change. 



  


Discounted Maintenance: CCI will give a discount to WMVAP’s support & maintenance contract of $1,000/year for every additional Weaverland Group that is subscribed to the Solution, for the duration of that Group’s subscription.
