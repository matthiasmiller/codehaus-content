Ben Reitz 09/04/2025: Note that the "PO Sent Date" uses the same approach as the "Sent for Approval" field on the Delivery Ticket detail screen.

  


Ellis Miller 09/04/2025: When setting the Buyer's PO # on a GemWood Purchase Order, add an OnChange that copies all other fields across, including RG fields.

Tim Reitz 09/10/2025: I think this note is irrelevant now.
