1\. Overview

GemWood would like to add a new "GemWood Purchase Order" printout to send to Members. This purchase order is created from and based on the Buyer's Purchase Order and is the new link to a Delivery Ticket. Buyer Purchase Orders can have multiple GemWood Purchase Orders linked, but only one Delivery Ticket can be linked to a single GemWood Purchase Order.

  


We are adding two new sections to the Purchase Order record, as well as adjusting some field behaviors in the Delivery Ticket record. We are also adding several new reports, a new printout, a new email, and two new notifications.
