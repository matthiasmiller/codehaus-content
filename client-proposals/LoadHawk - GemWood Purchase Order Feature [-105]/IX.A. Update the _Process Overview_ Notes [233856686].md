9.1. Update the "Process Overview" Notes

The general GemWood process is as follows:

  * Enter Buyer Purchase Order: Receive a purchase order from a Buyer and enter it into the LoadHawk Solution as a Buyer Purchase Order record.
  * Set up GemWood Purchase Order(s): Set up one or multiple GemWood Purchase Orders on the Buyer Purchase Order record, assign each to a Member, and send them to the assigned Member(s). 
  * Enter Delivery Ticket: Receive information about a delivery ticket from a Member and enter it into LoadHawk, as a new Delivery Ticket record that is linked to a specific GemWood Purchase Order. Typically this will include the Member's grade that determines the Invoice Price. In the rare situation where the Member does not grade, only the Buyer's grade determines the price.
  * Approve Invoice: Generate an Invoice printout in the LoadHawk, based on the Delivery Ticket, and email it to the Salesperson for the Delivery Ticket, for review and approval. If approval is denied, make changes as needed, then either mark it as approved or resend it to the Salesperson for final review and approval. 
  * Send Invoice: Generate the Invoice printout, and email it to the Buyer. This includes itemization and dollar amounts based on the Member's Grade. 
  * Make Preliminary Payment (In some cases): Send a preliminary payment from GemWood to the Member via ACH, based on the Delivery Ticket and the Member Payment Terms, and document it on a Member Payment record linked to the Delivery Ticket record. 
  * Settle Buyer's Payment: Receive and settle one or more payments from the Buyer (with negotiations as needed), and document it in the Solution on Buyer Payment records, linked to the Delivery Ticket record. 
  * Notify Member of Settlement: Close out the Delivery Ticket in LoadHawk (automatically or manually, depending on the conditions). Send an email to the Member to notify them that the Delivery Ticket has been closed.
  * Send Final Payment: Send final payment to the Member via ACH, based on the final Buyer's payment total, documenting it in the Solution on a Member Payment record, linked to the Delivery Ticket. 
  * Notify Member of Payment: Send an email from LoadHawk to the Member, containing the details of the Payment. 
  * Process Internal Payouts: Settle and pay the Sales Commission and Internal Fee Payouts, documenting the payment details on the Delivery Ticket record in LoadHawk.
