Work Orders Report

The work orders report will give options to view open work orders by priority, by assignee, or by location. There will also be options to see recently closed work orders as well as to search for older closed work orders.

  


New Work Order

The New Work Order option on the main menu lets you easily create a new work order.

  


Work Order Record

The work order record will have fields for:

  * Title
  * Equipment Name -- optional, can be selected from a list of available equipment. This will be a link to display the equipment record.
  * Location -- defaults to the equipment location, but can be overridable. Required.
  * Current mileage/hours displayed ("90,000 miles as-of 04/10/2017"). If this is more than a week old, show a red label "Please update the mileage/hours on the equipment record."  If the equipment piece tracks mileage/hours, don't allow completing the work order if the record is more than a week old.
  * Inspection link -- a link to the source inspection, if this originated from an inspection.
  * Priority
  * Assignee
  * Notes
  * Orig Date
  * Completion Date
