Design Notes

This design of this menu can be modified. For example, View Work Orders could be split into multiple options:

  * Create Work Order
  * My Work Orders
  * View Work Orders



  


Inspections could be modified to be:

  * Upcoming Inspections
  * Open Inspections
  * Completed Inspections



  


We can also decide whether we should first display the report with a default view, teaching users to rerun if they want other criteria, or if we should always first prompt them for the view. Alternatively we can have menu options for some of the default views and one option that prompts. The advantage of not prompting is that you are immediately launched into the desired report.
