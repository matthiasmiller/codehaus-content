The Pennsylvania Educational Improvement Tax Credit (EITC) Program has been a tremendous blessing to schools and businesses alike.  To increase the number of people and schools who can benefit from this program, Faith Builders has formed several Special Purpose Entities (FB SPEs).

  


Faith Builders will file applications for additional EITC spaces.  While there is no guarantee of any new state approvals, we are inviting applications in preparation for any approvals we may receive.  

  


We consider the following criteria when prioritizing applications for acceptance:

  * Date of receipt of application
  * Size of contribution 
  * School selection 
  * We will make an effort to benefit a variety of schools.
  * We will give priority to those applications designating 10% or more to Faith Builders as one of the school selections.



  


FB SPEs have the following operating characteristics:

  * FB SPEs require a minimum commitment of $3,000 for two consecutive years.
  * Applicants must submit their contributions within twenty days of acceptance of their application. 
  * 100% of the contribution will be sent to an approved scholarship organization.  We plan to use Faith Builders Scholarship Services, which charges a 5% administration fee and disburses the remaining 95% to schools designated by contributors.  
  * FB SPE members receive 90% of their contribution as a tax credit toward their Pennsylvania tax liability.



 

Please use this link to submit an application (Joinder Agreement): ___________.  I am attaching two documents: 

  * A copy of our operating agreement
  * A flyer with FAQs
