Member,

  


This is a reminder that your new SPE Joinder Agreement (received by mail) and payment are due soon.  To maintain your priority status for membership, we must receive the agreement and payment by September 1.  If you have already mailed them, please disregard.  If you have not received the packet, please contact me immediately.   

  


Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.
