We regret to inform you that Faith Builder’s SPE was not granted sufficient funds from the State to admit your application for the 2020 tax year.  We are optimistic that based on our history of approvals we will be granted further approvals for the 2021 tax year.

  


Be assured we are holding your request in our file of pending applications to be considered upon receiving further approvals.  

  


If check being held and no more approvals possible in year of check date:

Please amend your accounting records to reflect that your check #___ in the amount of $xx,000.00 is being shredded.  Any 2021 approvals will require a check dated in 2021.

  


You can anticipate that we will be in touch with you communicating further approvals received and opportunities to bless Christian Schools and receive state tax credits.

   

Should you have further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me at 814-789-4518 ext. 245 or at [lucym@fbep.org](mailto:lucym@fbep.org).
