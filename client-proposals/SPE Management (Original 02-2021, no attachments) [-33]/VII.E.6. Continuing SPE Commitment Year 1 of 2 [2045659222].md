  Member,

  


You have completed year one of a two-year commitment to a Faith Builders Special Purpose Entity.  We hope to continue our partnership with you and your support of Christian schools.  

  


No new paperwork needs to be filled out for the second year.

We will contact you around August 15 with a notice of payment due.

Payment due date will be September 15.

We hope to be able to have additional availability of funds.  You may wish to communicate with your tax preparer about the possibility of submitting an additional joinder agreement to increase your commitment amount for next year.  

  


Contact me with any questions at 814-789-4518 ext. 245 or at [lucym@fbep.org](mailto:lucym@fbep.org).
