The report should be grouped by member.

Member Application RepeatRG on School Designations

[ ] Subset: Admittance Status = Admitted

  


TODO_CH: Mockup says "(show in gray if selected in filter)" but there is no Active filter. Is the grouping wrong?  I think the grouping should be by member. I suspect mockup was copy/pasted from something else. Make sure it's in sync w/ Requirements.
