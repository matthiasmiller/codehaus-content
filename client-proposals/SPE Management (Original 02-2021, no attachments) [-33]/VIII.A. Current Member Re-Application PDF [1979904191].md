Faith Builders

Special Purpose Entity

  


  Member,

  


We are anticipating state approval for another two-year period for the Faith Builders Special Purpose Entity (FB SPE) in which you have been a member for the past x years.  As a current member, you have priority status for another two-year membership period.  

  


However, to confirm your continued membership, we require a new Joinder Agreement and your check by September 1.  Your contribution will be disbursed to the private school(s) of your choice.  You can continue to support the same school(s) as you have in the past or make changes.  

  


I am enclosing a joinder agreement pre-populated with current information.  The amount you contributed last year was $_________.  The Joinder Agreement lists the school(s) you designated and the percentage each received of your total contribution

  


Action Steps Required:

  * Review the pre-populated Joinder Agreement for accuracy and school designation(s) for your contribution.
  * Fill in the new contribution amount.
  * Adjust school designations and amounts if desired.
  * Sign the Joinder Agreement.
  * Make your check payable to Faith Builders Special Entity.
  * Mail completed Joinder Agreement and check in the enclosed envelope to arrive by September 1 to the following address:



       Faith Builders Special Entity

       ATTN: Lucy Miller

We remind you of FB SPE operating characteristics:

  * FB SPEs require a minimum commitment of $3,000 for two consecutive years.
  * 100% of the contribution will be sent to an approved scholarship organization.  We plan to use Faith Builders Scholarship Services, which charges a 5% administration fee and disburses the remaining 95% to schools designated by contributors.  
  * FB SPE members receive 90% of their contribution as a tax credit toward their Pennsylvania tax liability.
