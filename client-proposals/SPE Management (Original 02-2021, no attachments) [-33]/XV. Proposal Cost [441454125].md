15\. Proposal Cost

Custom Solution

CodeCrafters provides custom software solutions using AppHosting.zone's hosted software platform. There is an upfront cost for the custom application and a monthly subscription that includes hosting, a dedicated test system, ongoing support, and annual system updates.

  


Because of the size of the project, specific packages and options have been priced separately. These could be done in phases. The Base System includes requirements for a core deliverable.

* If the format of the PDF documents change, there is a risk that the PDF automation will be unable to process a PDF. This is particularly true for the Redacted PDF's. If such a change occurs, CodeCrafters will make necessary changes to the automation scripts on a Time & Material basis. It is recommended that a PDF automation is tested each November or December using a sample PDF to reduce the risk of an urgent change being required in the production system in January.

  


Support

CodeCrafters provides standard phone and email support. This includes answering general questions and supporting standard use of the product. Our team typically responds by email or phone within one business day. If a request goes beyond standard support, requiring additional application customization or premium support, we will offer you that option. 

  


Changes and Enhancements

When deploying the system, CodeCrafters will provide you an opportunity to use the system and provide feedback on features. CodeCrafters will attempt to integrate requested changes as part of the project. If requests go beyond the scope of the project, CodeCrafters will discuss with you how these should be prioritized.
