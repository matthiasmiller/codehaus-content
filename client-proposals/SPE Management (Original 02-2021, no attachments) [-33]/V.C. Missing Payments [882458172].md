5.3. Missing Payments

  


Requirements

Each SPE must apply to the state for approval of the Year 2 of 2 amount, and we are guaranteed approval for the identical amounts. We request payment from the partners for the second year before receiving the approval letter from the state. We must account for payments as they are received.   

  


Show a report of all Member Applications with an admittance status of Waiting for Payment.

  


It should prompt for:

  * SPE Application (blank = all)



  


The columns should include:

  * SPE # (Or reports for each SPE)
  * SPE Application
  * Member Name
  * Payment Due Date
  * Amount Paid
  * Amount Owed



  


It should be sorted by Due Date (oldest first).

  


This report will not group by SPE Application to avoid burying the due date. To group payments by SPE Application, simply sort the report by SPE Application.
