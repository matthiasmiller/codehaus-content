15\. Google Groups

  


Requirements

We want to be able to assign specific people access to certain calendars. We will do this by automatically adding/removing members to/from Google Groups.

  


We will be able to associate certain roles with Google groups.

  


These can be defined as one or more roles:

  * Scope - Only This Role / This Role and Downlines
  * Role - List of Roles



  


Development Specification

Great use for the triggers.
