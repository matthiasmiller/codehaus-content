8\. Personnel Information

  


Requirements

Each staff or volunteer will be entered into the database. This will include their name, email, and any relevant contact information.

  


We will store the SSN but will restrict it to the individual themselves and to the administrator.

  


We will hide/restrict the time off policy. This will be visible to the personnel and to any uplines.

  


We will have an notes field. This will be hidden from the personnel and will be visible to any uplines.

  


We will also track compensation method (hourly/salary) as well as rate. This will be restricted to the personnel and all uplines.

  


Development Specification

We will need to warn about updating the email, because they will most likely need to update their contact. (See PC?)

  


Compensation method/rate need to be accessible in surveys.
