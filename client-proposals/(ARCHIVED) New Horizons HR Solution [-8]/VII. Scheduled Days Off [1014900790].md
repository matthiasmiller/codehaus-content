7\. Scheduled Days Off

  


Requirements

We also need to track scheduled days off.

  


This will simply use an untracked time off policy.

  


USER SPECIFICATION

We will add a "Request Day Off" option that will prompt for Next Week or Two Weeks, then show an option for Day of Week.

  


We will not allow people to save overlapping time off requests. If they want to use a Scheduled Day Off as part of their vacation, they can choose that on the main vacation request.

  


Development Specification

  * How much work to add a date picker?
