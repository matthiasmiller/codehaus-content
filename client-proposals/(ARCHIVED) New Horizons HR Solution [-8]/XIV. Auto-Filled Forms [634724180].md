14\. Auto-Filled Forms

  


Requirements

We are planning to support fillable PDF forms. However, it will be your responsibility to create and maintain these PDFs. We will provide instructions on integrating these into the system.

  


Development Specification

HISTORY / OLD NOTES 

If this doesn’t work, we can perhaps pursue another (more expensive) solution.

  * Talk to Leslie about creating fillable PDFs
  * Review Worker’s agreements
  * Most of this could be tied into the onboarding…



 

For the worker’s agreement:

  * Store PDF with the contact
  * Upon completion -- you see the PDF



 

Idea for Nate:

  * We could send a task with a link to a report with the information, as well as the W2?
  * Let me brainstorm with Ellis/Josh -- could we do this with .r21s.
    * Maybe half of them are on the DOC list?
  * If not, we can store them back to the person.
    * It’s not a big deal if they have to do that....
