9\. Personnel Roles

  


Requirements

Each staff or volunteer will have a list of all current and past roles. This will track:

  * The date their role started
  * The date their role ended (if it’s active)
  * The role’s division (if relevant)
  * The "Salary vs. Hourly"



  


If the individual’s role, division, or salary/hourly changes, we will need to end the first role and start a second one on the following day.

  


We will treat it as the same role if it’s within two business days. If not, we will warn unless the roles are more than 3 months apart.

  


Their vacation time will accrue as long as all roles are within two business days.

  


Each person can be accountable to multiple people. For example, this happens if:

  * They work at the store and live in the dorm
  * They have multiple uplines filling the role and division (i.e. the housedad and housemom of their house)



  


Anyone who can modify the org chart can modify any of the roles. However, note that managers cannot transfer themselves.

  


In addition, any upline can modify roles anywhere within their org chart, but nowhere else in the organization.
