13\. HR: Online Applications

  


Requirements

We will be able to define publicly-accessible forms that are associated with an email address. The person will need to specify the email address to access. Each option on the form will include:

  * A label/formatted text
  * A type (number, date, email, phone, list). Lists can optionally allow 1 or more user-supplied items
  * A condition (can reference a prior list and include/exclude a question based on a value)



  


Individuals will be able to log in with their email address to start their application. They will work to complete their application, then submit it when it’s final.

  


Each application can be turned into a printable report with all of the answers. (We will still require paper applications for certain situations.)

  


The application can be used to generate a new Contact.
