21\. Printouts/Templates

  


Requirements

The database will need to generate multiple PDF printouts. These can then be printed as paper copies.

  


The current printouts are:

  * Building Infosheet
  * Sales Quote (Cash, RTO, ?)
  * Sales Order (Cash, RTO, ?)
  * Work Order (can have muliple types - move job, build, etc.) 
  * RTO Contract (always included with RTO Sales Order?)
  * Property Owner Release Form 
  * Customer Referral Payment Letter
  * Time Sheet Printout



Tim Reitz 12/07/2021: This would go with the check.

TODO_CH: how would it be to generate a printout of the time sheet?

  


Data access for templates in the database: Editable by Full Admin only
