27.2. Possible Future Enhancements

*Cost analysis - at least the material costs. Would be neat to include labor and transport costs... 

  


* Time Off Requests (not a big help at this point). 

  


*Online lead generation from IdeaRoom: IdeaRoom sends in a 3D visualizer, and BEB manually make a quote off that and assign it to the appropriate dealer. A possible future enhancement would be to build out integration with IdeaRoom to automatically create the quotes and assign them to the dealer.

  


* At the point that we need to handle multiple RTO Companies, we could save the RTO company name on the RTO and Repo Sales Orders, then have the Repo process copy it back onto the building. 

  


*Phase 2-3 to integrate salary, take off time, payment (but not necessarily relevant to the sales quote/building deliver process).

  


*Would be a good idea to add a reminder for quote followups (similar to sales opp followup dates)

  * Have a default number of days for followup -- with an adjustable reminder date
  * Have alerts within the system -- most intuitive
    * Sending an email would also work
    * If they have to manually pull the report, probably won’t be effective
  * The reminder would disappear??
    * Leads Needing Followup
      * Allow a way to defer another 5 days
      * Allow a way to close out quotes
    * Have buttons on the report alert



  


* NOTE: They don’t any time or cost tracking right now -- might be a good idea, but they don’t track

Product Cost / Hour -- in the shop -- what does the WHOLE product line cost per hour

  * You can figure it out by square feet produced, if they can figure out how SQFT are produced
