18.2.1. Payments

TODO_CH: Where does this belong? Under QB or its own section? 

TODO: break this down more and spec it out more. 

  


Everyone gets paid on a 2-week basis

  * Get paid every two weeks
  * It’s regardless of whether the building has been delivered
  * If cancellations happen, then that’s a chargeback that comes out of the mix



  


Payments Within Bald Eagle: 

The manufacturer (Benchmark Buildings) owns the building until it’s sold, at which point:

  * Once the building gets delivered, then Bald Eagle Barns collects all the money from the customer.
    * TODO: Is this actually at delivery? Or is the money collected sooner? 
  * When the building is marked as delivered, it will automatically invoice the companies for the predetermined percentages.
  * Benchmark Buildings sends invoice to BEB, and BEB sends checks: 
    * Benchmark Buildings for their portion
    * Bald Eagle Transit for delivery
  * On the next deposit sync, they’ll collect all the money, push the customers/invoices/payments
    * Rosewood Rentals pays for buildings they’re buying



  


The syncing happens on the days that they do deposits 

The current syncing process is very manual

  * It was supposed to have been automated, but because of slowness in the process, the automated version could not work
  * They actually have to log into their server, and manually run these macros, and wait until they’re completed, make sure there are no errors, and manually go to the next thing
    * You need to have a pretty good knowledge of how that works,
    * Training someone else to do is hard
  * They do deposits on Wednesdays and Fridays, and that’s when they do they syncs



  


Three separate companies in QB and three separate checking accounts

  * The ones who have access to accounting need to have access to all three



  


Checks for member labor are printed under Member Labor, with subcategories of the members' initials. 

  


  


Paying Dealers:

  * When they pay dealers, they need to be able to pull the sales the dealers has made, and write a check of that.
  * That is probably under the category of filtering sales by salesmen, but it may be a little different 
  * Custom percentages on a per dealer basis
