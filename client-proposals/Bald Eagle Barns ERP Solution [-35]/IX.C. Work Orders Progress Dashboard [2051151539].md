9.3. Work Orders Progress Dashboard

TODO_TR: [https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#label/C.+Design+Phase%2FBald+Eagle+Barns/FMfcgzGkZkLrnGbdwndPjsSmwzVJMChR?projector=1&messagePartId=0.1](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#label/C.+Design+Phase%2FBald+Eagle+Barns/FMfcgzGkZkLrnGbdwndPjsSmwzVJMChR?projector=1&messagePartId=0.1)

  


Only available on the office side (Office Workers, Member Salespeople, admins) 

  


As tasks/pieces are completed, they show up on the dashboard

DONE_JM: How do you envision the dashboard? Is this just a view of the order?

TODO_TR / TODO_CH: Tim Reitz 08/03/2021: He says a list of Work Orders, where you would click on a WO and see it broken down by departments; each department would show as completed as it is finished.

Tim Reitz 08/03/2021: I'm thinking a split screen report: left side has a list of WO (maybe just the ones that are in progress; or at least grouped by in progress/not in progress); right side has departments and tasks...

Tim Reitz 10/26/2021: Would be nice for the report to show progress bars for each Department...

Tim Reitz 09/16/2021: Or is this just the Work Orders report? 

Tim Reitz 08/04/2021: Note: See the screenshot Jason sent me on 8/3 (Re: workorder screen.png) for what they currently have.

  


  


Track things like: 

  * What tasks have been completed
  * Where is it at in the overall process
