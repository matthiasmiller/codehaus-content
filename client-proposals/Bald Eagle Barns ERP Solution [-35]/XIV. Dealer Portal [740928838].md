14\. Dealer Portal

TODO_TR: clean up/ remove(??) 

  


There should be a portal for dealers to access their part of the process

DONE_CH: Is this actually a portal/WSGI or are these user logins for a "Dealer" user group? 

Matthias Miller 06/11/2021: Josh likes portal/WSGI. Ellis likes restricted data. See if we can make restricted data work simply.

  


Dealers have access to some of the data, but not everything. For details, see the Permissions / Data Restriction section of this proposal. 

  


If a dealer would quit for some reason, there should be a simple way to remove the login, change the password, and add a new dealer portal time

  


  


  


  


DONE_JM: How many dealers?

Tim Reitz 12/07/2021: 8-9 for now; probably adding more in the future

  


  


TODO_TR: One of the things he doesn't want to have happen, is to create buildings that are not sold. What can we do to ensure this?
