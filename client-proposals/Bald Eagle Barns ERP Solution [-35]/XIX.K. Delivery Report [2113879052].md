19.11. Delivery Report

TODO_TR: spec this out 

  


Delivery

  * Move Jobs -- when the driver delivers a move job, they pay a % to the driver for building moves, it would be helpful if on that delivery log / calendar -- if there’d be a way for them to mark that he completed the move, and the cost value and calculate that for him



  


TODO_TR: either separate or a filtered version of this main report: have a Deliveries by Driver report
