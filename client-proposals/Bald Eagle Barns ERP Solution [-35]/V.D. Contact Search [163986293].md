5.4. Contact Search

  


Requirements

BEB would like the ability to quickly search for a contact by phone number or by address and pull up a report of the contact and any linked buildings. For example, when a person calls in, the user should be able to search by phone number to get advance information on who’s calling and what they might be wanting.

 

This is initiated by clicking on a "Contact Search" menu option (on the Main Menu). This opens a prompt/search page with the same fields as the filters for the main Contacts report: 

  * Phone Number (search by partial) 
  * First Name 
  * Last Name 
  * Street Address (search by partial)
  * City 
  * State 
  * Zip 
  * Building Serial # (search by partial; returns names for customers associated with the corresponding building(s))
  * Active Contacts Only (checkbox; default to filled) 



  


Clicking Continue on the prompt page would open the BEB Contacts split-pane report (the same one used as the main Contacts Report):

  * The left pane would show Contacts results, filtered down to show only results that match the entered search criteria.
  * The right pane would show Buildings results for the selected contact.



  


*Done.
