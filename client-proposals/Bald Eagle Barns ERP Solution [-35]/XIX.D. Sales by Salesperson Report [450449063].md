19.4. Sales by Salesperson Report

TODO_TR: finish speccing this out 

  


This is a report of sales data that could be filtered by Salesperson. If filtered by Salesperson, it would report only on sales made by that Salesperson. If filtered to include all Salespeople, it would report on all sales.

  


This would be accessed from the main menu (with a prompt for Salesperson, defaulting to blank = all) or from the Salesperson contact detail (defaulting to the corresponding Salesperson). 

  


This would not show General sales or Move Jobs, etc. 

TODO_TR: have a separate report for all sales, filtered by type.... 

  


Title: Sales by Salesperson

DONE_CH: how much extra work would it be to include the salesperson's name in the title ("Sales by Salesperson - John Doe") if it is filtered down? 

TODO_TR: Easy peasy lemon squeezy

  


TODO_CH: how would it work to also include Building Serial # and Sale Price? (and presumably SO - link to record) 

  


TODO_TR: include this as a print option when they run payroll (separate page for each member salesperson)
