Requirements

Purpose: This printout is generated if an RTO customer is not the owner of the property on which the building is to be located. The purpose is to formalize a 3-way agreement between RR, the customer, and the landowner. 

  


Printed From: RTO-type Sales Orders

  


File Format: PDF

  


Fields to be Filled: 

  * Landowner Name (FirstName LastName)
  * Address (Street Address) 
  * City 
  * State (2 letter abbreviation)

  * Building Color ("Siding / Trim / Roof" format; e.g. "Red / White / Gray") 
  * Customer Name (FirstName LastName)
  * Copyright year at bottom of form (fill with the current year) 



  


DONE_CH: since this is a fillable PDF, can we just use it and fill it? 

TODO_TR: We don't have a good way to do that. It would be easier just to go ahead annd use a template.

  


Template: Provided by BEB on 10/19/2021. 

  


Other Notes:

  * None of the lines at the bottom of the form (name, address, phone number, etc.) are to be auto-filled. These are to be filled manually by the involved parties.
