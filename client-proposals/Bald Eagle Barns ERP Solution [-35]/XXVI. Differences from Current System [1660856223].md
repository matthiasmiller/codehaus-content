26\. Differences from Current System

  * Secondary Email on the Contact record - They use these rarely enough that we are dropping this field. Thse can be saved in the Notes memo.
  * Instead of default tabs, we have Favorites. In addition, you can create a folder bookmark group in Chrome and open all tabs at once.
  * BEB currently uses a Dealer-type contact called "IN TRANSIT" to track buildings that are in transit between lots. CCI/CH will take care of setting this up. This is not relevant any more with using WOs and Location records.
