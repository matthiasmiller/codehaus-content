12\. Customer Payments & Refunds

DONE_CH: Jason said it would be handy to have printouts for payments/refunds. It might not be something that they use all the time (so don't require it or do it automatically

TODO_TR: Isn't this as simple as speccing out a template based on the information on the SO, and payments/refunds?

  * Receipts
    * Customer
    * Itemization
    * Payment/Refund Amount
    * Payment Date
    * Payment Method
    * Check # (if check)
    * PO # (if PO)
    * Notes
