7.1.3. Creating Fully Custom Buildings

To create a fully custom building, the salesperson would create a new Building SKU, using the "Fully Custom Building" style, and would spec out the building on this SKU. When the salesperson creates the SKU, the only option for "Building Style" would be the "Fully Custom Building", which limits from from being able to create other SKUs. 

  


After the custom SKU has been created, the salesperson would create a building record as usual, using that SKU. 

  


These custom SKUs would remain on the "Building Item Code" list after being created, so to avoid cluttering the list an Admin user should periodically review the Building SKUs and deactivate the custom ones so they don't continue to show up in the list for building records. A possible future customization would a background process to automatically deactivate custom SKUs, or a periodic notification to an admin of custom SKUs as a reminder.

  


*Done.
