24\. Data Migration

  


Requirements

All data from the existing database will be migrated to the new database by CodeCrafters/CodeHaus, in coordination with BEB. Because of the large volume of data and the unknowns regarding how "clean" the data will be, this will be done on a Time & Materials basis rather than fixed-price. 

  


  


TODO_TR: move these to the appropriate place: Salesperson commissions will be stored directly on the Salesperson record. The Dealer Location with be stored in the City field of the Dealer's address.

  


Development Specification

Note from early design: Jason would prefer if we'd just take the SQL database, pull what we need, and push it into the new one.
