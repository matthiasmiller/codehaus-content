7.5. Building Search

  


Requirements

This would be be the buildings' equivalent of the Contact Search.

  


This is initiated by clicking on a "Building Search" menu option (on the Main Menu). This opens a prompt/search page with the following fields:

  * Serial # (search by partial) 
  * Customer (drop list of all customer contacts, filters down as you type; looks for the current Building Contact) 
  * Sale Date Start (default to blank = all; look at all Sale Dates for all Sales Orders for the building) 
  * Sale Date End (default to blank = all; look at all Sale Dates for all Sales Orders for the building) 
  * Salesperson (drop list of all, active and inactive) 
  * Building Item Code (drop list of all, active and inactive) 
  * Siding Color (drop list of all, active and inactive) 
  * Trim Color (drop list of all, active and inactive) 
  * Roof Color (drop list of all, active and inactive) 



  


Clicking Continue on the prompt page would open the Building Search Report, which is a split pane report:

  * The left pane would show the Historical Buildings by Customer Report, filtered down to show only results that match the entered search criteria.
  * The right pane would show the standard Contacts report, showing only results for the selected Building.



  


Buttons:

TODO: If/when we pick up this design again, let's split this into 2 or 3 columns to reduce the height.
