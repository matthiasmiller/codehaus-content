25\. Deployment

TODO: Will we do a hard deploy like ZWA? Or soft like ZTD? Either way, we should plan and time it carefully since we are migrating all of their data (how to handle order numbers, etc.). Let's add notes in this proposal for documentation.

  


Tim Reitz 07/17/2021: Per the Sales Opp, there will be 20-25 users. We should take this into consideration (it takes some time to set up that many users). 

  


Tim Reitz 06/23/2021: Copied from other proposal. Needs tuning.

As part of the initial package, CodeCrafters/CodeHaus will provide a special level of support for the deployment of the software solution. This would begin before deployment and would be in effect for __ weeks after the initial deployment date. 

  


This would include:

  * Intentional planning and communication 
  * Importing of data (as noted in the Data Migration section of this proposal)
  * Training for users (approximately __ hours of CH time; via Zoom calls and/or recorded videos)
  * A basic user's guide or list of tutorial videos in the Wiki section of the software, available long-term
  * Weekly check-ins to provide opportunity to discuss questions, problems, and ideas
  * Premium-level support access (already included in the Premium Subscription type; see the Proposal Cost section of this proposal for more details)
  * An update to the software within a few weeks after the initial deployment to fix important issues or make important changes (as needed)



  


CodeCrafters/CodeHaus would also aim to provide an update to the software 3-5 months after the initial deployment to fix less urgent issues and to make additional changes to the software (as needed/desired; see the Changes and Enhancements notes in the Proposal Cost section of this proposal for more details)

  


The purpose of this is to help with a smooth transition and strong foundation for the long-term success of this software. 

  


CodeCrafters/CodeHaus can also provide access to the test system for ___ and other ___ team members prior to the deployment of the live software. The purpose of this is to allow users to become familiar with the software in a sample environment (softening the learning curve) and to help ensure that the software matches your workflow and expectations (reducing surprises and follow-up changes).
