3.1. Entities

  


Requirements

This database will handle various interactions between the entities of BEB and the RTO company. These entities will automatically be added as organization contact records in the database, and there will be limited editing capabilities for these contact records.

  


These entities are as follows: 

  * Bald Eagle Barns (this is the dealer / sales side of the business and the face of the enterprise; use the Dealer contact type)
  * Benchmark Buildings (this is the manufacturing side of the business; no contact type)
  * Bald Eagle Transit (this is the delivery / logistics side of the business; no contact type)
  * Rosewood Rentals LLC (this is the one RTO company that BEB works with at this point; use the RTO Company contact type)



  


*Done.

  


Development Specification

These are Investortools-owned contact records.

  


TODO_CH (later): what things do we need to track specially on these records? do we need to link individuals to these?

Tim Reitz 09/13/2021: From Matthias: question will probably come later in regards to payments/payroll - who is associated with which one, etc.
