30\. Inventory Management (Materials)

Phase 1 does not include tracking inventory quantities for SKUs.

  


_CH: should we get Josh involved with this? 

  


Materials: (this is tracking SKUs)  

Primary goal: 

Secondary goal: 

  


Need a way to enter materials when they arrive and track when the items leave inventory (either when used on buildings or when sold separately) 

  


DONE_JM: when should we pull materials from inventory? 

Tim Reitz 09/17/2021: Currently: 

when the salesperson sells a building, it goes to a queue, but shows "Work Order not printed"

when the foreman prints the work order, it shows "Work Order in progress" 

\- we could pull inventory at this point

  


And so as far as costing, it’s hard to figure out the cost basis on the building

  


He calls it an assembly:

  * Where it takes this many of these materials (2x4s, siding, skids, nails, etc)
  * Once the work order is printed, it would pull the inventory assigned to that building at that point
  * The end goal is being able to tell COSTING, primarily
  * With a 2-month lead time, they have the possibility of building this building under cost, because of the way this is appreciating, but if they don’t build it for two months -- the material prices rise so rapidly
  * SECONDARY goal is being able to get the inventory tracking 
  * They don’t have this, which is part of the reason for getting more in-depth reporting basis.
  * Run a report today, and this is what the cost of materials is for the materials that we have in this specified time frame
    * They can print those reports, and keep track of their cost basis
    * Know where they’re at
  * Currently have lots of excel files
  * Have a good idea where they’re at, but takes time to get there
  * 


  


Finished Goods (buildings): (this is being done with the Building Inventory Report)
