1.1. New Process

The software designed by CodeHaus/CodeCrafters would have the following main features:

  


  * Contacts: The contacts records would be used to track information for customers, members, vendors, and more.
  * Buildings: The building records would be the source of truth for information pertaining to the buildings, with a record for each building that is designed/built by BEB, tracking it from design through construction and sales, and would continue to track historical information after the building has been sold.
  * Sales Quotes/Orders: The sales quote/order record would be used to track quotes and orders for buildings and general merchandise, as well as change orders and other things as needed.
  * Work Orders: The work order record would be used to store and track the details about work being done on a building (e.g. initial construction, move job, maintenance, etc.).
  * Tasks: The task records would be used to track information about work that needs to be done (e.g. construction work on a building, general work, and possibly deliveries and more).
  * Customer Payments: These records would be used to track payments from and refunds to customers.
  * Internal Payments: These records would be used to track internal payments, such as payments between entities and to members.
  * Calendar Scheduling: The database would integrate with Google Calendar to provide scheduling for deliveries and service jobs.
  * QuickBooks Sync: The database would sync many things with QuickBooks.
  * Reporting: There would be many reports to report on things such as sales, KPIs, profitability, deliveries, and more.



  


Other smaller features would also be included, but aren't described in this overview. These include things such as time tracking, user notifications, and customer referral program handling.

  


The basic process for buildings would be as follows:

  * For lot buildings:
    * Create Building Records (normally from templates)
    * Create Work Orders for the buildings
    * Start work on the Work Orders (using Tasks)
    * Move the building to a sales lot after it is completed
    * Sell the building by creating a new Sales Quote and advancing it to Order status
  * For custom buildings:
    * Create a new Building Record and set the details
    * Create a Sales Quote 
    * Create a Work Order for the building
    * Advance the Sales Quote to Order status when the client is ready to purchase it
    * Start work on the Work Order for the building
    * Deliver the building to the customer when it is completed



  


*Done.
