13.1. Building Layout Shapes

The layout editor will have a set of shapes defined using:

  * Name
  * SVG (via document archive)
  * Width Feet (number)
  * Height Feet (number)
  * Size X (checkbox)
  * Size Y (checkbox)
  * Allow text (checkbox)



  


These shapes will include things such as:

  * Lines
  * Boxes
  * Doors (quarter circles/ovals)
  * Text



  


Each option can have a shape associated with it, along with the shape width (feet), length (feet), and text.
