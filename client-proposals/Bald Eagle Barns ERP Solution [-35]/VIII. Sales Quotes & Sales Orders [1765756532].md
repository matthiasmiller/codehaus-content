8\. Sales Quotes & Sales Orders

Sales Orders will be a custom record type that are created when a customer is ready to purchase a building (or some other item). 

  


When a customer wants to buy a building, the salesperson will first create the Building record, then create the Sales Quote record by clicking the link/button on the Building record.
