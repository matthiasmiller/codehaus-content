13\. Layout Editor

  


Requirements

Each of the base building SKUs would have their own diagrams. Each building record would create a copy of this diagram, along with any additional shapes from additional options. Both the base building SKU and the building record would have an option to create a new diagram or to copy another diagram (by ID).

  


The diagram would open in a new editor with the option to add new shapes, rotate existing shapes, and delete existing shapes.

  


TODO_CH: Research what it takes to migrate the old diagrams over as read-only versions.
