3.7. Sales Tax Codes

The software will track sales tax codes and rates, both individual jurisdictions (State, County, and City) and combinations of them. These will be tracked on separate records. 

  


These codes will normally be set up in QB and synced to this software. In the database, these will only be editable by Admins. Any changes made in the database would be overridden by the next sync from QuickBooks. 

  


The database will automatically sync all Sales Tax Groups and Sales Tax Items from QuickBooks. See the corresponding section of this proposal for more details. 

  


If a Sales Tax Code is deleted in QuickBooks, it will be deactivated in the database on the next sync.

  


*Done.
