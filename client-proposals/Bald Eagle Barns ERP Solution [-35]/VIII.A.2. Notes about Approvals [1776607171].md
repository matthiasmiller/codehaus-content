8.1.2. Notes about Approvals

Edge Case: If a non-member salesperson sells a lot building with additional custom options, and the BEB member doing the approval decides that it is better to build a completely new building: 

  * Copy the building record of the initial building
  * Set the Building Contact and any other details on the new building record, and save the new record
  * Go to the Sales Order and change the linked Building to the new building, and save the record 
  * Go back to the initial building record and clear the Building Contact and any other details as needed, and save the record
