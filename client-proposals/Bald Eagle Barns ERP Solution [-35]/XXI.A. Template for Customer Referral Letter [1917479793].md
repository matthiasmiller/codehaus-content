21.1. Template for Customer Referral Letter

  


Requirements

Purpose/Overview: The Customer Referral Letter would be printed and sent to Referring Parties who have referred customers to BEB. These would print out on a per-Referred Customer basis, with all letters from a single printing batched together in one PDF file. If a Referring Party has referred more than one customer in the same printing, there would be a separate letter for each Referred Customer. 

  


This letter would not be used for Dealer Referrals (a separate report printout would be generated for them). 

  


This should be printed on a full sheet of paper with the BEB letterhead.

  


The BEB return address and the Referring Party Address should be printed in the bottom 1/3 of the page so that the page can be folded and inserted into a #10 window envelope.

  


Note that this letter should use the "FirstName LastName" format for all of the inserted names instead of the "LastName, FirstName" format used elsewhere in the database.

  


Printed From: Customer Referrals Report
