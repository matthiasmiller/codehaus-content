16.1. Internal Payments

TODO_TR: lots of things happen between the 3 entities and RTO company. 

TODO_CH: we can probably use the Payments records with a separate category??? adjust fields? 

  


  


  * Barns should pay Transit for all Move Job SO's and all deliveries (but not for hauling new buildings from the factory to the lots) 
  * Transit would not automatically pay Barns for anything
