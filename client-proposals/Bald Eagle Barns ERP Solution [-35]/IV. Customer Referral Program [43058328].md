4\. Customer Referral Program

BEB has a referral program where a person/organization or Dealer can receive an incentive for referring someone else to BEB. This is tracked by filling a "Referring Party" field on the Sales Order. 

  


There are two main approaches to reimburse Referring Parties for referrals: 

  * Standard Customer Referrals: When the referring party is a previous customer or other such party, they are rewarded in the form of a check for a set amount (currently $40.00; configured in Financial Configurations). BEB sends a letter to the referring party along with the check. This letter would be printed form the Customer Referrals Report. See details about the template in the corresponding section of this proposal.
  * Dealer Customer Referrals: There also are times when a customer first visits an independent Dealer, then comes to the main BEB location to actually purchase a building. In cases like this, the independent dealer receives a referral check for a set amount (currently $100.00; configured in Financial Configurations). Dealers do not get the referral letter; instead they get a printout with a report of all the referred customers who are included in the check. This printout also would be printed from the Customer Referrals Report. 



  


Note that there is no limit on the number of times that a contact can be the Referring Party. 

  


Note that referral program is normally only used for new purchasing customers, so a customer will only have one "Referred By" name and date stored. If a customer has the "Referring Party" field filled in on a subsequent Sales Order, have a warning on the Sales Order: "This customer has previously been referred." If they wish to continue, the existing Referred By information will be replaced by the new.

  


*Done.
