5.3. Contacts Report

  


Requirements

This would be a customized two-pane report, which would also be used for the Contact Search results.

  


This would be accessed from a menu option on the Main menu called "All Contacts"

  


  * The left pane would show the BEB All Contacts Report, filtered down to show only results that match the entered information.
    * Columns: 
      * Name (LastName, FirstName)
      * Contact Type
      * Phone
      * Phone Type
      * Email Address
      * Street Address
      * City
      * State
      * Zip
      * Summary
    * Grouped by: Status (Active/Inactive)
    * Sorted by: Name
  * The right pane would show the Historical Buildings by Customer Report (see corresponding section of this proposal).

Development Specification

Mockup: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QDfhJsb9R2t3m7P-jnaljWfYJbscNJiLwyZCiXcOXV0/edit#gid=1619383528](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QDfhJsb9R2t3m7P-jnaljWfYJbscNJiLwyZCiXcOXV0/edit#gid=1619383528)

  


TODO_CCI: The Contacts report in the left pane probably would be a custom report that is similar to the standard Contacts report (different mainly because of the ask prompts).
