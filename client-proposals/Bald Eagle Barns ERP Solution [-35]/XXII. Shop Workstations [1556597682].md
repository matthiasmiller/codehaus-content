22\. Shop Workstations

We might need to end up doing an integration or WSGI for the shop logins... 

  


  


Currently have work stations in the shop 

Windows Surface Pro

  * Mostly the touchscreen option -- might be a couple that might be using a USB keyboard and mouse
  * All currently that
  * Had been using some Macbooks / CompuSticks -- standardized
  * The login is a 4-digit pin, 



For the framing section, there are different buildings

  * Might be 2-3 framers, it logs out after 5 minutes automatically
  * Put their PIN in, pulls up their tasks, marks what they’ve completed
  * The cut man will print off the order, with the parts on the rolling part, when the buildiner grabs the cart, that’s the serial number, when it pulls pul the building he can do, then marks the task on that building--the builder 
    * Checkin and checkout
    * The paper copy stays in the building as it goes down the line, and the person working on it,
    * Have a Work Order number and a serial number
