21.3. Sales Quote/Order Printout

TODO_TR: spec this out

  


TODO_TR: if the Status is Order, call it "Sales Order / Invoice"

  


TODO_TR: Small detail -- on the move jobs invoice, they have a little damage waiver disclaimer that gets populated on there, just a block of text that is only added to that invoice

TODO_JM: what is this text? 

  


  


  * Logo
  * BEB address
  * BEB phone number



  


  * RTO Contract Balance (note that this currently does not show on the SO printout, but it should) 
    * TODO_JM: should this be updating live, or is it just the total minus the deposit?
