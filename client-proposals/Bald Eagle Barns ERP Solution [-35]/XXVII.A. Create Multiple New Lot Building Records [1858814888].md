27.1. Create Multiple New Lot Building Records

TODO_TR: Duplicating an existing Building Record 1X is easy. Do we have a way to duplicate it 5 or 10X? 

Tim Reitz 10/11/2021: let's look into an x30 that copies the same building multiple times. Probably a field on the building if there is no customer assigned - "Create Multiple Copies" with a number field and a Continue button. 

Tim Reitz 10/18/2021: This could be a future enhancement... 

Matthias Miller 10/22/2021: Yes, we can do this. Think about what gets copied/doesn't get copied. Maybe restrict to lot buildings.
